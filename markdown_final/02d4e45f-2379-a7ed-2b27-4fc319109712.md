## Question

50 yo F with known hereditary angioedema (HAE) presents with mild urticarial rash and throat tightness after eating at a restaurant; BP 120/75, O2 98%. She has carried epinephrine autoinjector since a child, and you are asked if you should immediately administer standard IM epinephrine 0.3 mg for her symptoms while awaiting further management.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to give intramuscular epinephrine 0.3 mg immediately to a 50-year-old woman with known hereditary angioedema who now has a mild urticarial rash and throat tightness after eating out, and what the rationale should be while awaiting further management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of HAE and whether it responds to epinephrine. Then, I should verify the diagnostic implications of urticaria in HAE. Next, I will assess whether this presentation meets criteria for anaphylaxis and whether that changes management. After that, I need to check guideline-based treatment for HAE attacks, especially with airway symptoms. Finally, I will weigh risks and benefits of epinephrine in this context and outline immediate actions and documentation needs, including what to do if uncertainty persists [^6a2bb389] [^8da1f693] [^90a02d77].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and treatment response in HAE. HAE is bradykinin-mediated, not histamine-mediated, so epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are not effective for aborting HAE attacks, though epinephrine may offer only transient symptomatic relief without altering the disease course, which is why guidelines recommend against using epinephrine for HAE attacks [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499] [^21991763].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of urticaria here. Urticaria is not a typical feature of HAE; its presence makes me consider a concurrent allergic process or an alternative diagnosis, but it does not convert a bradykinin-mediated HAE attack into a histamine-mediated process that would respond to epinephrine, so I should not jump to conclusions that epinephrine will treat the HAE component itself [^92c18994] [^118f05b9].

> I need to check whether this meets anaphylaxis criteria. The current presentation includes skin findings and possible respiratory involvement with throat tightness, but there is no hypotension, no severe respiratory compromise, and no multisystem involvement yet; this does not meet diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, and importantly, a lack of response to epinephrine should not be used to diagnose anaphylaxis, so I should not rely on epinephrine response to clarify the diagnosis in this case [^90a02d77] [^4e4d52a3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about withholding epinephrine entirely. Even though HAE itself does not respond to epinephrine, if there is a concurrent IgE-mediated allergic reaction, epinephrine could still be appropriate for that component; however, in this case the skin findings are mild and there is no clear allergic trigger identified, so the balance favors not giving epinephrine for the HAE attack itself while I prioritize HAE-specific therapy and airway monitoring [^6a2bb389] [^8da1f693].

> Next, I should review what to do right now. I will administer HAE-specific on-demand therapy as early as possible because throat involvement is high risk; options include intravenous C1 inhibitor concentrate, subcutaneous icatibant, or subcutaneous ecallantide, with C1 inhibitor or icatibant generally preferred for self-administration and early treatment, and I should arrange urgent transport to a facility capable of airway management while monitoring closely for progression [^8da1f693] [^25d610af] [^92684d8e].

> I should double-check airway management principles. For progressive upper airway edema in HAE, guidelines recommend early consideration of intubation or surgical airway, and given the unpredictable trajectory, I need to ensure continuous observation and readiness to escalate airway interventions if voice changes, dysphagia, or stridor develop [^2515ed9c] [^bb6b07d3].

> Let me consider supportive care and what to avoid. I will avoid relying on epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids for the HAE attack itself, and I will avoid fresh frozen plasma unless no HAE-specific therapy is available, given the risk of exacerbation; instead, I will provide supportive care tailored to symptoms and ensure the patient has access to at least two on-demand HAE treatments going forward [^67f38499] [^148a145f].

> But wait, what if this is actually anaphylaxis masquerading as HAE. I should document the absence of multisystem involvement, the known HAE diagnosis, and the bradykinin mechanism to justify withholding epinephrine for the HAE process, while remaining vigilant; if new features emerge such as hypotension, severe bronchospasm, or multisystem involvement, I would reconsider anaphylaxis and treat accordingly with epinephrine for that entity, recognizing that this would be a separate indication rather than treatment of HAE itself [^90a02d77] [^4e4d52a3].

> In summary, I should not administer intramuscular epinephrine for the HAE attack itself because HAE is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to epinephrine; instead, I will treat immediately with HAE-specific on-demand therapy, secure urgent transport with airway-capable care, and monitor closely for deterioration, documenting the rationale for withholding epinephrine in this HAE context while remaining prepared to treat if true anaphylaxis emerges [^6a2bb389] [^8da1f693] [^90a02d77].

Do not give **epinephrine** for this HAE attack because HAE is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499]. The mild urticaria does not indicate anaphylaxis, and epinephrine will not relieve HAE symptoms or prevent airway progression [^92c18994]. Instead, **administer HAE-specific therapy** (C1 inhibitor, icatibant, or ecallantide) urgently and monitor the airway closely [^8da1f693] [^bb6b07d3]. Reserve epinephrine only if true anaphylaxis is suspected or if HAE-specific therapy is unavailable and the airway is deteriorating, recognizing it may provide only transient benefit [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499].

---

## Pathophysiology of hereditary angioedema

HAE results from **C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction**, leading to unchecked bradykinin production and increased vascular permeability [^7afa8c98]. Unlike allergic angioedema, HAE swelling is not histamine-mediated; thus, epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are ineffective [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines explicitly advise against using **epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids** for HAE attacks because they do not alter the bradykinin-driven process [^6a2bb389] [^21991763]. Recommended first-line treatments are HAE-specific agents such as C1 inhibitor concentrate, icatibant, or ecallantide, which target the bradykinin pathway and are effective when given early [^8da1f693] [^641a325b].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding epinephrine efficacy in HAE

There is **no evidence** that epinephrine meaningfully reduces HAE attack severity or duration; any benefit is transient and does not change outcomes [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499]. Case reports and series consistently show nonresponse to epinephrine, reinforcing that it should not be used for HAE attacks [^2ce6b991] [^8edebc77].

---

## Risks and limitations of epinephrine administration in HAE

While epinephrine is generally safe, in HAE it can cause adverse effects (tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety) without therapeutic benefit, potentially delaying effective care and creating a false sense of security [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499]. It should be reserved for suspected anaphylaxis or when HAE-specific therapy is unavailable and the airway is worsening [^notfound].

---

## Differentiating HAE from anaphylaxis

Urticaria with HAE is uncommon but possible; the presence of hives alone does not establish anaphylaxis in a known HAE patient [^92c18994]. Anaphylaxis requires **multisystem involvement** (respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal) or rapid progression after exposure to a likely allergen [^f7faebda]. Here, the patient has isolated throat tightness without systemic features, making anaphylaxis unlikely [^notfound].

---

## Recommended management approach

- **HAE-specific therapy**: Administer C1 inhibitor concentrate, icatibant, or ecallantide as soon as possible for laryngeal involvement [^8da1f693] [^bb6b07d3].
- **Airway monitoring**: Continuously assess for progression; be ready to intubate if airway compromise worsens [^2515ed9c].
- **Supportive care**: Provide oxygen, IV fluids, and analgesia as needed; avoid epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids unless treating a different diagnosis [^6a2bb389] [^67f38499].
- **Observation**: Monitor for several hours after treatment, as HAE attacks can evolve slowly [^eb482c41].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not administer **epinephrine** for this HAE attack; it will not help and may distract from effective therapy. Treat with HAE-specific medication urgently and monitor the airway, reserving epinephrine only for proven or strongly suspected anaphylaxis or when HAE-specific therapy is unavailable and the airway is deteriorating [^6a2bb389] [^8da1f693].

Angioedema manifests as episodes of localized swelling in the dermis and submucosa. The key to successful management is detection and avoidance of triggers, early recognition of attacks, and aggressive airway management when warranted. Review of a patient's medication list may identify drugs that include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers as the cause. Initial treatment in a patient presenting with most forms of angioedema includes antihistamines and glucocorticoids if required. Epinephrine should be administered if there is concern for laryngeal edema. Patients who have a known history of hereditary angioedema should receive C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma.

Hereditary angioedema is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States.

The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

Using EAs for suspected anaphylaxis — Guidelines recommend prompt epinephrine injection for the sudden onset of any anaphylaxis symptoms after exposure to an allergen that previously caused anaphylaxis in that patient, and early treatment before, or at the first sign of, symptoms can sometimes prevent escalation of symptoms. In a community setting with a known exposure that previously triggered anaphylaxis, generalized acute urticaria is not life-threatening yet it could be beneficial to inject epinephrine to prevent additional symptoms; when it is difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from other entities, if unsure, erring on the side of caution and injecting epinephrine, then observing the patient closely, is advised.

Urticarial/angioedema associated with signs and symptoms in organs other than the skin, such as the pulmonary tract (wheezing) and cough, gastrointestinal system (vomiting and diarrhea), nervous system (dizziness and loss of consciousness), or cardiac system (changes in blood pressure or heart rate), can occur in patients with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. (D), and physicians should prescribe epinephrine for patients with acute urticaria/angioedema when a diagnosis of anaphylaxis is suspected, including that in patients presenting with acute urticaria who might have the potential for development of anaphylaxis (eg, food allergen or insect sting), injectable epinephrine should be prescribed.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — acute attack management — states that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE, and neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs provide reliably effective treatment for acute attacks. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating HAE attacks but might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and caution is required; management can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of swelling. Guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and randomized trials demonstrate efficacy and safety for treatment of attacks with C1INH concentrate, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

ACE‑I or ARB–associated angioedema — management emphasizes drug discontinuation and airway vigilance: the management of ACE‑I (or ARB)–associated angioedema is discontinuation of the ACE‑I (or ARB), and discontinuation is the cornerstone of therapy although there might be a significant time lag before the propensity for angioedema abates. During acute attacks, patients need to be observed in a controlled environment in case they require intubation, and treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine has not been shown to be efficacious. Efficacy of icatibant and fresh frozen plasma has been described for ACE‑I–associated angioedema; however, no controlled studies have been reported.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^31418d08]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

WHEN SHOULD HAE BE SUSPECTED? PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

Evidence of the HAE-GI symptom overlap comes from both observationaland single-case studies,–(Table 2). HAE should be suspected when a patient presents with a history of recurrent cutaneous angioedema attacks. Secondary considerations include family history of HAE; onset of symptoms in childhood/adolescence; recurrent and painful abdominal symptoms; occurrence of upper airway edema; swelling that fails to respond to antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or epinephrine; presence of prodromal signs or symptoms before attacks; and the absence of urticaria. Once HAE is suspected, laboratory investigations (ie, C4, C1-INH level and function) should be carried out regardless of absence or presence of painful abdominal symptoms, as C1-INH levels (Type 1) and C1-INH function (Type 1 and 2) are consistently low during both asymptomatic and symptomatic periods. C4 levels are consistently low in most (> 85%) individuals with HAE and will be low in all patients during an angioedema attack. For a diagnosis of HAE, a history of recurrent cutaneous angioedema attacks, and a low (< 50% of normal) C1-INH result are required; a low C4 (at baseline or during attack) is also expected.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^eb482c41]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack characteristics — HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks of angioedema involving the extremities, genitourinary tract, abdomen, face, oropharynx, or larynx (C). Patients typically present with discrete episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting angioedema at these sites; HAE attacks are usually distinguished from allergic or idiopathic angioedema by their longer duration and lack of response to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. The typical HAE attack tends to progressively worsen for 24 hours and then slowly remit over the following 48 to 72 hours, although attacks can occasionally last longer, particularly if the swelling moves from site to site.

### The international WAO / EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema-the 2017 revision and update [^4b2bf278]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential. This update and revision of the global guideline for HAE provides up-to-date consensus recommendations for the management of HAE. In the development of this update and revision of the guideline, an international expert panel reviewed the existing evidence and developed 20 recommendations that were discussed, finalized and consented during the guideline consensus conference in June 2016 in Vienna. The final version of this update and revision of the guideline incorporates the contributions of a board of expert reviewers and the endorsing societies. The goal of this guideline update and revision is to provide clinicians and their patients with guidance that will assist them in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1-inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1-inhibitor (type 2). The key clinical questions covered by these recommendations are: (1) How should HAE-1/2 be defined and classified?, (2) How should HAE-1/2 be diagnosed?, (3) Should HAE-1/2 patients receive prophylactic and/or on-demand treatment and what treatment options should be used?, (4) Should HAE-1/2 management be different for special HAE-1/2 patient groups such as pregnant/lactating women or children?, and (5) Should HAE-1/2 management incorporate self-administration of therapies and patient support measures?

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^82a3099c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT SYMPTOMS SHOULD PROMPT EPINEPHRINE ADMINISTRATION?

Anaphylaxis lies along a spectrum of allergic symptoms (Figure 1), ranging from mild-moderate respiratory symptoms to circulatory shock ("anaphylactic shock"). IM epinephrine should be used to treat all anaphylaxis reactions, including those with less severe symptoms. Although fatal reactions occur despite epinephrine use, appropriate and timely epinephrine administration may buy time until patients can be resuscitated in a health care setting. This is supported by data showing that fatal reactions progress rapidly, with the median time to respiratory or cardiac arrest of 30 minutes for foods and 15 minutes for venom. The challenges of recognizing anaphylaxis and the inconsistent use of epinephrine are well documented in both health care and community settings. Even in specialist food challenge settings, underuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is common. Patients and caregivers also face challenges recognizing anaphylaxis and determining when to administer EAI. They are unlikely to have formal medical training and may be hesitant to use EAI because of needle phobia or reluctance to activate emergency medical services (EMS) or attend the ED afterward. Alarmingly, in a survey of 245 food-allergic teenagers with anaphylaxis, epinephrine was used in only 17% of cases; it was administered in only 50% of patients with loss of consciousness, 23% with breathing difficulties, and 15% with wheeze.

Inconsistencies in anaphylaxis definitions may contribute to variation in epinephrine use. Although guidelines concur that the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is IM epinephrine, they do not necessarily agree on which signs and symptoms constitute anaphylaxis (Table II).– There is general agreement that patients with cardiovascular and/or respiratory involvement should be treated with epinephrine. However, there are gray areas where the need for epinephrine is less clear — such as vocal hoarseness (signaling laryngeal edema) without respiratory compromise, mild wheeze without obvious respiratory compromise, or subjective respiratory symptoms (eg, chest tightness). In such scenarios, one approach, at least in health care settings, might be to administer epinephrine only if symptoms worsen or do not resolve. However, does this send the wrong message to patients and caregivers — that as health care professionals, we are looking for reasons not to administer epinephrine?

### Management of anaphylaxis [^c0ff345c]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic reaction that can be managed appropriately with expedient diagnosis and treatment. Intramuscular epinephrine continues to be the mainstay of treatment of anaphylaxis; however, it is still underused in the community and in the medical setting. Further education and counseling of patients and health care providers is required to prevent and manage anaphylaxis successfully. In-office management of anaphylaxis includes training of staff, preparedness with the necessary supplies and medication, and an effective action plan.

### Treatment of laryngeal hereditary angioedema [^2ce6b991]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the emergency department, patients with laryngeal swelling and an inconclusive patient history may receive treatment for allergy-mediated angioedema. Intubation may be necessary if the patient does not respond to treatment. Because angioedema subtypes respond to different interventions, a correct diagnosis is vital.

Objectives

Review the differential diagnosis of angioedema and characteristics differentiating subtypes. Discuss therapies for angioedema subtypes. Introduce therapies for prevention and acute treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE).

Case Report

A 10-year-old girl presented with laryngeal swelling unresponsive to diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, and epinephrine. It was later revealed that she had a family history of HAE, was C1 inhibitor deficient, and enrolled in a clinical study of acute HAE treatment. She was given 1000 units of nanofiltered C1 inhibitor and was able to swallow within 30 min. She was prescribed routine prophylaxis with C1 inhibitor concentrate and has had no subsequent severe HAE swelling attacks.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the need for providers to consider HAE in light of available diagnostic testing and recent Food and Drug Administration approval of specific therapies for HAE.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute management emphasizes avoidance of ineffective therapies, selective use of plasma, and access to on-demand agents: Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE; fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating attacks but might actually exacerbate some attacks and therefore requires caution; management can include symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling; neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs are likely effective for acute attacks; guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and evidence from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials demonstrates efficacy and safety for treatment with C1INH concentrates, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^f213a5cf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^ec97eca3]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

### Patient communications: why is It important to quickly use epinephrine at the onset of symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis? [^449273e8]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Delayed administration of epinephrine (adrenaline), the first-line and only effective treatment of a systemic allergic reaction (SAR) and anaphylaxis, is associated with increased mortality. However, epinephrine is underused because of a lack of consensus as to when it should be administered and an inappropriate fear of using epinephrine and potential adverse effects from the medication. The authors emphasize that SARs and anaphylaxis should be considered as a spectrum, and that affected individuals be educated on its safety and repeatedly given instructions as to when and how epinephrine should be used at the first symptoms or signs of SAR and anaphylaxis.

### On-demand therapy for hereditary angioedema [^ca4508be]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Consensus guidelines on hereditary angioedema (HAE) recommend that all patients have access to on-demand treatment of acute attacks. A recent patientcentric guideline recommended that at least 2 on-demand therapies be available because patients often have heterogeneous responses to different medications. Self-administration of therapeutic agents, or administration under supervision by a health care provider in the home setting, is the preferred treatment approach. Future studies are needed to show the benefits of acute on-demand therapies at improving quality of life and reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with HAE.

The Study

In May 2017, a 61-year-old female wildlife biologist reported onset of diffuse urticaria and lip edema (day 0) (Figure). She called a consulting nurse and was advised to take ranitidine and diphenhydramine; symptoms resolved within 24 hours. On day 29, she had itching in her groin and noted urticaria on her back. Within a few minutes, she reported that her tongue felt swollen; she called 911, noting difficulty speaking. Paramedics documented diffuse urticaria, tongue edema, dysphonia, inspiratory wheezing, systolic blood pressure at 80 mm Hg, and heart rate at 120 beats/min. Epinephrine (0.3 mg) was administered intramuscularly (IM) for anaphylaxis, and mild improvement was observed. However, within several minutes, her clinical course worsened, and notable progression of tongue edema, throat tightness, and onset of tunnel vision occurred. A second dose of epinephrine (0.3 mg IM) was administered. While enroute to the emergency department, symptoms progressed, and she was given methylprednisolone (125 mg IM) and nebulized racemic epinephrine. Upon arrival at the emergency department, her symptoms were improving, and examination revealed mild urticaria and blood pressure of 117/57 mm Hg. She was discharged after a 4-hour observation and prescribed prednisone, famotidine, diphenhydramine, and an epinephrine autoinjector.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and mucosal swelling that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Several novel therapies introduced since 2008 have dramatically transformed the approach to management. In this review we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HAE, diagnostic evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria, and the therapeutic approach to HAE.

### Hereditary angioedema… [^02192c2e]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Acute exacerbations of the disease should be treated with intravenous purified C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate, where available. Intravenous administration of fresh frozen plasma is also useful in acute HAE; however, it occasionally exacerbates symptoms. Corticosteroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine can be useful adjuncts but typically are not efficacious in aborting acute attacks. Prophylactic management involves long-term use of attenuated androgens or antifibrinolytic agents. Clinicians should keep this disorder in their differential diagnosis of unexplained, episodic cutaneous angioedema or abdominal pain. Two case reports14, 15 describe migrainelike and transient ischemic attack symptoms during acute HAE. Others9, 16, 17 have reported seizures and hemiparesis. These symptoms are thought to be caused by local cerebral edema and consequent cerebral hypoperfusion, caused by the acute HAE episode.

Fever and leukocytosis are unusual in acute HAE, and their presence during an attack in a person known to have HAE should raise suspicion that another process, such as infection or intra-abdominal catastrophe, may be the inciting event for the acute exacerbation. Recurrent abdominal pain and upper airway and facial edema occurred in 52% and 36%, respectively, of patients in one series. 9 In 39% of these cases, patients could attribute their first episode to an identifiable traumatic event. 9 Most patients with symptomatic untreated HAE experience at least 1 acute exacerbation per month, and because each attack typically lasts a few days before spontaneously subsiding, it is estimated that individual patients can be debilitated by their symptoms for 20 to 100 days per year.
3. Typical HAE attacks usually subside spontaneously after 2 to 5 days.

However, the risk of death from a vicious cycle of bradykinin and complement fragment production exists during every acute episode until appropriate therapy is administered to raise serum levels of active C1-INH or until spontaneous remission occurs. Spontaneous remission may occur because the rapid consumption of various substrates during the acute attack rapidly outstrips the body's ability to manufacture them. In patients with angioedema from causes other than heredity, urticaria is a frequent accompanying symptom. Urticaria seems to be primarily a histamine-mediated event, whereas angioedema seems to be mediated primarily by bradykinin. This explains why patients with acute HAE typically have no urticaria.

### Hereditary angioedema [^4b2831cc]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

Additional mimics include hereditary angioedema, ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema, diffuse urticaria, scombroid, mastocytosis, drug-related red man syndrome, and rare causes of pronounced flushing such as pheochromocytoma and carcinoid.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^92684d8e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute HAE on-demand pharmacotherapy and airway management — There are currently 3 medications approved in the United States for the treatment of acute attacks of angioedema: plasma-derived C1INH, the B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant, and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and on-demand treatment is most effective when administered as early as possible in an attack. Standard angioedema treatment modalities, such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, or antihistamines, do not have a significant effect on swelling; fresh frozen plasma can sometimes cause a sudden worsening and carries the inherent risk of viral transmission, and attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytic agents are not effective; the use of one of the newer specific medicines is preferred. If specific effective on-demand medication is not available, symptomatic care can include narcotic medications for abdominal pain, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and aggressive hydration; out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, should be avoided. Management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is focused on maintaining airway patency; all such patients should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy and should be closely monitored for change in voice, loss of ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^b904ead5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Management and therapeutic options for patients with mast cell disorders: Treatment of patients with MCAS is highly individualized and targeted to bothersome symptoms and the underlying pathology. Acute management of an activation attack corresponds to systemic anaphylaxis care: hypotensive episodes should be managed by patients assuming the supine position, followed by administration of intramuscular epinephrine; laryngeal angioedema requires intramuscular epinephrine; bronchospasm can be treated with intramuscular epinephrine or an inhaled rapidly acting bronchodilator, such as albuterol. Patients at risk for such events should carry an epinephrine autoinjector, and if epinephrine is used, the patient should strongly consider being taken to the emergency department by ambulance while remaining in the supine position. Prevention focuses on identifying and avoiding triggers (insect venoms, temperature extremes, mechanical irritation, alcohol, or medications such as aspirin, radiocontrast agents, and certain anesthetic agents), attenuating mediator effects, and potentially reducing MC responsiveness or numbers. A patient with SM sensitive to insect venom, particularly with a history of systemic anaphylaxis to a prior insect sting, should undergo lifelong venom immunotherapy, and using omalizumab during immunotherapy appears to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis to venom immunotherapy. Eliminating additives in drugs by compounding to treat or prevent anaphylaxis is not recommended; notably, for 100 patients with chronic urticaria, 43 of whom complained of additive allergies, single- or double-blind challenges ruled this out in all patients.

### Is epinephrine truly lifesaving, and can we prove this? [^e3b21f01]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Injectable intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is touted as "life-saving", in particular because observational studies have identified lack of prompt epinephrine treatment as a critical risk factor associated with anaphylaxis fatality. Although association is not causal, few would argue that epinephrine is not the optimal treatment for anaphylaxis, and do we have sufficient proof to suggest that epinephrine is actually "life-saving"? Epinephrine indeed works swiftly to reverse such symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. However, there are abundant observational data that many cases of anaphylaxis are inherently self-limited and may resolve within 1 to 2 hours in most cases with or without treatment. In this perspective, the intent is to address and reframe the reality of the evidence we do have for what epinephrine does and does not accomplish and provide a perspective regarding the common "dogma" regarding the drug. There is a danger in using terms such as "life-threatening" and "life-saving" for anaphylaxis and epinephrine treatment, especially under the caution of frequently cited rhetoric that subsequent reactions are likely to be progressively more severe or potentially fatal. Use of such descriptions risks negatively polarizing our patients and adversely affecting their quality of life, given these terms can potentiate unnecessary fear. Epinephrine is in fact a wonderful drug, but it is important to not lose sight of the evidence for what it actually does in anaphylaxis treatment and why it is important to use this drug in anaphylaxis, as opposed to an emphasis on what it does not do.

Clinical Features Distinguishing HAE-nC1INH from Mast Cell–Mediated Angioedema

Unlike the vast majority of mast cell–mediated angioedema, HAE-nC1INH patients have either a family history of recurrent angioedema or a genetic pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be associated with it. Attack trajectory and location are important distinguishing features. HAE-nC1INH attacks tend to progress more slowly, last longer, and are more likely to involve the abdomen or require intubation compared to mast cell–mediated angioedema. Treatment response is another important distinguishing feature between the two types of angioedema. Unlike mast cell–mediated angioedema, patients with HAE-nC1INH show no response to high-dose H1 antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or omalizumab but may respond to KKS targeted treatments such as C1INH concentrates, bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists, or plasma kallikrein inhibitors (see treatment section below). Fibrinolytic inhibitors such as tranexamic acid or anti-estrogens, such as danazol or some progestins, may also be effective in HAE-nC1INH. Mast cell–mediated angioedema is the most common diagnosis in patients with recurrent angioedema, underscoring the urgent need for a reliable biomarker to distinguish these diagnoses.

Treatment should be based on the aforementioned evaluation and suspected diagnosis. The patient should be immediately placed in a supine position if hypotensive. If hypotension improves, vasovagal syncope is the likely diagnosis and requires supportive treatment. If anaphylaxis is suspected, epinephrine should be administered promptly as first-line treatment. No other treatment should delay epinephrine because delay can lead to worse outcomes. If hypotension persists, epinephrine can be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes and intravenous fluid resuscitation can be used as an adjunctive therapy. Oxygen and airway support should be provided in case of hypoxemia, and albuterol can be used as an adjunctive therapy in case of respiratory distress. Because of delayed onset, antihistamines and corticosteroids have minimal role in the management of anaphylaxis and may help only in the treatment of cutaneous symptoms or as an adjunct treatment of respiratory symptoms; however, these agents should not be used as first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Treatment with oral antihistamines is appropriate if a nonanaphylactic cutaneous reaction such as urticaria or angioedema occurs. If suspicion is high for an acute stress response, close monitoring until symptoms improve with effective reassurance and behavioral relaxation techniques may promote a quick recovery. Vocal cord dysfunction should be suspected in a patient whose reaction manifests as an asthma exacerbation but does not improve despite albuterol inhalation. In these cases, referral to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation may be warranted.

Chronic evaluation and management of COVID-19 vaccine–induced anaphylaxis (Fig 2)

When a patient with a possible reaction is referred to an allergist, a careful history is essential to make a correct diagnosis. Supporting documentation and an acute serum tryptase level provide helpful additional information. If suspicion for anaphylaxis is high, one should consider obtaining baseline tryptase because 5% of the White population carries a recently discovered genetic trait called hereditary α-tryptasemia, which is associated with baseline elevated tryptase levels. Additional history of severe anaphylaxis due to insect venom or drugs should prompt further evaluation for a possible mast cell disorder or hereditary α-tryptasemia.

### Emergency department management of hereditary angioedema attacks: patient perspectives [^07b2b9fe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been hindered by misdiagnosis and limited treatment options. Food and Drug Administration approval of 4 on-demand HAE therapies starting in 2009 and the publication of ED guidelines for angioedema management in 2014 should facilitate improvement of HAE management in the ED.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify patient-reported areas for improvement in ED management of HAE attacks.

Methods

Patients with self-reported HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency who attended the 2015 HAE Association Patient Summit were asked to complete an anonymous 30-question survey. Questions addressed patient characteristics and HAE management in the ED.

Results

Patients indicated that understanding of HAE in the ED needed improvement (99%, 104 of 105 patients). Recognition of HAE as a diagnosis (48%, 50 of 105 patients), appreciation of HAE as a serious disease (45%, 47 of 105 patients), and medication management (59%, 62 of 105 patients) were identified as areas needing improvement. Among 39 patients who required ED care within the last year, 6 did not receive any HAE-targeted therapy, and treatment with corticosteroids (n = 3), epinephrine (n = 2), and antihistamines (n = 7) was reported. Among 68 patients whose treatment plan was to receive home on-demand therapy, 26 required ED care because of an inability to receive on-demand therapy at home as outlined in their treatment plan. Having a treatment plan was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving HAE therapy in the ED (99% vs 74%, P = 0.002).

Conclusion

HAE management in the ED can be improved with a focus on recognition of HAE attacks and administration of effective HAE therapies.

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^ba5abfe6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment.

Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of hereditary angioedema in the emergency department [^92c18994]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema (AE) is a clinical syndrome marked by localized swelling of the subcutaneous layer of the skin or the submucosal layer of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. While AE is commonly mediated by histamine (allergic AE), some types result from excessive bradykinin activity, including hereditary AE (HAE), acquired AE, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced AE. These are less common but important to consider given different treatment requirements and potentially serious outcomes, including death from laryngeal swelling.

Objective

This review describes the pathophysiology and clinical features of AE as well as the diagnosis and treatment of AE in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

Bradykinin-mediated AE does not respond to antihistamines and corticosteroids. By contrast, several targeted, effective therapies are available, including C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates, which replace the missing protein activity underlying some bradykinin-mediated AE, and medications that directly lessen bradykinin activity (eg, ecallantide and icatibant). Urticaria is generally absent in bradykinin-mediated AE and serves as a primary differentiating factor in the clinical diagnosis. Relevant laboratory assessments may include C1-INH levels, C1-INH function, and C4 complement. Patients with HAE or a family member can communicate their known diagnosis when presenting to the ED, and some may even bring their own medication(s) with them. Patients newly diagnosed with HAE in the ED should be referred for specialized outpatient care upon ED discharge.

Conclusions

There is a great need for ED clinicians to be aware of HAE, its differential diagnosis, and appropriate treatment to ensure that patients receive optimal and timely treatment.

Anaphylaxis — key considerations for EMS: When anaphylaxis is suspected, EMS personnel should always consider epinephrine as first-line treatment. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergencies, and a localized allergic reaction (e.g., urticaria or angioedema that does not compromise the airway) may be treated with antihistamine therapy. Cardiovascular collapse may occur abruptly, without the prior development of skin or respiratory symptoms, and constant monitoring of the patient's airway and breathing is essential.

Acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — treatment parallels hereditary angioedema (HAE) with notable differences: the treatment of acquired C1INH deficiency is similar to that for HAE, although with increased efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to diagnose an underlying condition; acute attacks do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids and have only a transient and nondurable response to epinephrine. For long‑term prophylaxis, androgens and antifibrinolytic drugs have been successfully used, and patients with acquired C1INH deficiency often respond better to antifibrinolytic drugs than to 17α‑alkylated androgens. Strategies to decrease anti‑C1INH antibody levels include plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and high‑dose intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 autoantibody‑positive patients treated with rituximab experienced sustained remission.

### Berotralstat effectiveness and safety in patients with hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor [^835b82f5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2026). Medium credibility.

Patients whose disease responds to antihistamines are likely to have mast cell–mediated angioedema — an important differential diagnosis for HAE. Therefore, a trial of antihistamines is recommended in the WAO/EAACI guidelines for the diagnosis of HAE and was a criterion for inclusion of patients without demonstrated genetic defects in this case series. In a United States survey, 73% of physicians reported using antihistamine response to inform diagnosis in this patient group.

In the current series, when defining the criteria for acceptance of a diagnosis of HAE-nC1-INH in the absence of genetic evidence, it was apparent that opinion varied between case contributors regarding how an adequate trial of antihistamine treatment should be defined, with national differences apparent. French case contributors would typically recommend that antihistamines should be prescribed for at least 3 months, whereas in the United Kingdom a shorter duration of 4 weeks was considered adequate. Elsewhere, the length of time during which 3 angioedema attacks might be expected has been proposed as a suitable trial of antihistamine receipt in this situation. The duration of a prophylactic trial is also influenced by the frequency of attacks, with authors more likely to accept a shorter duration if the attack frequency is very high. If disease of a patient with angioedema and no identified variant fails to show a response to 4-fold the maximum guideline-stated dose of an antihistamine, some clinicians would add in the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab as the next step; this is included in a recent expert consensus. Others may consider targeting the KKS.

Another factor that may complicate the diagnosis of HAE-nC1-INH is the co-occurrence of more common histamine-mediated disorders. Patient 6 had a preexisting diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria but had concurrent angioedema that did not respond to an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody in the same way the urticaria did. This demonstrates the importance of considering an alternative, potentially additional diagnosis if there is insufficient response to an appropriate treatment targeting the histaminergic pathway. Some centers reported routinely following a nonresponse to antihistamines or steroids by treating the next attack with icatibant to point to a diagnosis of HAE-nC1-INH before initiating LTP. Other real-world data demonstrate that similar practices are commonplace: 74% of physicians surveyed in the United States used response to a HAE-specific medication to inform diagnosis, with the majority prescribing icatibant.

### Anaphylaxis:: after the emergency department [^aaf1da3e]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

After treating the acute anaphylactic reaction, the clinician's next task is to prevent a recurrence. The patient should be observed in the ED. How long this observation period should last depends on their clinical course, risk factors, and social support. All patients should be discharged with a prescription for 2 epinephrine autoinjectors and counseled on appropriate use. The patient should also receive education on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and avoiding triggers. The patient should follow-up with an allergy specialist who can confirm triggers and provide immunotherapy as indicated.

Patient Information

EPINEPHRINE injection (ep-in-eph-rine),

for intramuscular or subcutaneous use

For allergic emergencies (anaphylaxis)

Read this Patient Information leaflet carefully before you use epinephrine injection, and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. You, your parent, caregiver, or others who may be in a position to administer epinephrine injection should know how to use it before you have an allergic emergency.

This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about epinephrine injection?

1. Epinephrine injection contains epinephrine, a medicine used to treat allergic emergencies (anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, can happen within minutes, and can be caused by stinging and biting insects, allergy injections, foods, medicines, exercise, or other unknown causes. Symptoms of an anaphylaxis may include:

trouble breathing
wheezing
hoarseness (changes in the way your voice sounds)
hives (raised reddened rash that may itch)
severe itching
swelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue
skin rash, redness, or swelling
fast heartbeat
weak pulse
feeling very anxious
confusion
stomach pain
losing control of urine or bowel movements (incontinence)
diarrhea or stomach cramps
dizziness, fainting, or "passing out" (unconsciousness)

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^e706ba3d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. – The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage — something that is not surprising given the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the treatment of acute allergic reactions. There is reasonable evidence from observational studies to support the use of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. Indeed, one might consider this scenario to be analogous to the absence of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of parachutes in reducing mortality from "gravitational challenge."However, there is an important difference: in the absence of a parachute, high-altitude falls are almost certain to result in death. In contrast, data from cohort studies including large patient registries indicate that in at least 80% of anaphylaxis events, the allergic reaction resolves despite nonuse of epinephrine. We do not want individuals at risk of anaphylaxis to attempt a version of "Russian roulette," and we cannot condone the nonuse of epinephrine when anaphylaxis occurs. At the same time, there is a need for safe, cost-effective, and evidence-based strategies to optimize patient outcomes and ensure appropriate health care utilization and resource allocation. We provide a balanced commentary on EAI prescription and usage to stimulate discussion about optimal clinical care of individuals at risk of anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS

See boxed WARNINGS at the beginning of this information sheet.

Do not administer allergenic extract injections intravenously. Patients should always be observed for at least 20 to 30 minutes after any skin test or injection. Concentrated allergenic extracts should be diluted with Sterile Diluent for Allergenic Extract prior to use for intradermal testing and for immunotherapy preparation. Systemic reactions may occur infrequently and may range from mild exaggeration of the patient's allergic symptoms to urticaria, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, angioedema, cough, wheezing, fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, or even, in extremely sensitive individuals, to anaphylactic shock and death. Have epinephrine 1:1,000 readily available in case of a reaction. Emergency measures and personnel trained for medical emergencies should be immediately available in the event of a life-threatening reaction. Patients with unstable asthma or steroid dependent asthmatics and patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are at greater risk. Patients taking beta-blocker medication may not respond to the usual dose of epinephrine.

Diagnostic testing as well as immunotherapy should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose reduced until cause of reaction is evaluated by prescribing physician if any of the following conditions exist: (1) severe symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma, (2) infection or flu accompanied by fever, (3) exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection, and (4) systemic reaction to previous injection.

### Hereditary angioedema [^df36d3fa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a C1-inhibitor deficiency. It is characterized by potentially life-threatening recurrent episodes of angioedema of the skin and mucosa. Several recent studies have further elucidated the immunology of HAE implicating bradykinin, the key mediator of the contact system. This article reviews the pathophysiology, subtypes, and clinical features of HAE. Therapeutic approaches for various clinical situations (emergency and prophylactic regimens) are also discussed.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) on-demand agents — efficacy, dosing, approvals, and use: Summary Statement 19 states, "All patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent." "Evidence from double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials demonstrates the efficacy and safety of treatment of HAE attacks with C1INH concentrates, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (A)." Plasma-derived C1INH products are approved for attacks, as "Both of the plasma-derived C1INH concentrates have been approved for use in adolescent and adult patients with HAE (Cinryze in Europe and Berinert in Europe and the United States) to treat acute attacks," while bradykinin-pathway agents are also approved, as "Ecallantide (Kalbitor; Dyax, Burlington, Mass) and icatibant (Firazyr; Shire, Dublin, Ireland) have been approved for use in the United States for treatment of acute attacks in patients with HAE who are 16 years and older and 18 years and older, respectively." Berinert dosing shown effective is "Berinert (20 U/kg)… safe and effective," whereas "the dose of 10 U/kg did not provide significant relief." Ecallantide is effective and administered as "Ecallantide (30 mg administered subcutaneously as 2–3 separate injections)," but safety requires oversight because "Two to three percent of treated patients have experienced anaphylactoid-type reactions," and "the US Food and Drug Administration requires that ecallantide be administered by a health care professional in a medically supervised setting." Icatibant is effective and user-friendly, as "Icatibant (30 mg administered as a single injection)" and "Icatibant was approved for self-administration and has a good safety profile, except for pain at the injection site." For clinical application, "Treatment with HAE-specific agents is preferred for all acute laryngeal/oropharyngeal attacks and for moderate-to-severe attacks at other anatomic locations causing patient disability," an international paper "recommended consideration of an on-demand treatment for all attacks in all locations," and "Patients with HAE should have a contingency plan for management of acute attacks."

Diagnostic Algorithm for Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

The diagnosis of HAE should be considered in all patients with recurrent angioedema without hives. Proper diagnosis utilizes four modes of investigation: (1) clinical presentation (phenotype), (2) pathomechanism, (3) biomarkers, and (4) genetics. The diagnostic process is complicated by the reality that in clinical practice, many angioedema patients will have an unknown pathomechanism while validated biomarkers and genetic studies are either unavailable or uninformative. Thus, a combination of all the above parameters is highly desired but often not attainable. In the absence of helpful laboratory data, clinicians must assess the patients' responses over time to empiric treatment with medications targeting potential pathogenic pathways. This strategy can also be challenging as it requires prolonged patient engagement in a systematic stepwise treatment approach and may lack robust objective methods to assess efficacy. The algorithm below and Fig. 1 summarize the recommended approach for evaluating these patients. This approach may need to be further adapted according to the available expertise, testing facilities and resources. Patients presenting to an emergency department with an angioedema attack of unknown cause should be referred to a physician familiar with angioedema who can undertake this evaluation.

Step 1. Is the Diagnosis Tenable?

Confirm a clinical history of documented recurrent angioedema without hives. Photos and laryngoscopic and imaging evidence of angioedema are essential to differentiate true angioedema from factitious angioedema or patients who mistakenly believe they have angioedema based on non-angioedematous symptoms, both of which are common in patients (mis)diagnosed with HAE-nC1INH (Table 4). In the case of predominant gastrointestinal attacks, obtaining abdominal imaging during an attack can be useful to evaluate for bowel wall edema and intraperitoneal fluid. A detailed family history and medication history should be obtained in all patients with recurrent angioedema.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of angioedema and angioedema mimics

Step 2. Exclude C1INH Deficiency

Measure C4, C1INH antigen, and C1INH function (if available), even if the patient is taking a medication that may cause angioedema. If acquired C1INH deficiency is suspected based on age of symptom onset, C1q level and anti-C1INH antibodies should be measured. Sequencing of SERPING1 is not routinely required, but can be helpful to distinguish acquired C1INH deficiency from HAE-C1INH, especially in patients aged > 40 years.

5	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has occurred in 4% of treated patients. Administer KALBITOR in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis and hereditary angioedema. Given the similarity in hypersensitivity symptoms and acute HAE symptoms, monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions (5).

5.1	Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis

Potentially serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients treated with KALBITOR. In 255 HAE patients treated with intravenous or subcutaneous KALBITOR in clinical studies, 10 patients (4%) experienced anaphylaxis. For the subgroup of 187 patients treated with subcutaneous KALBITOR, 5 patients (3%) experienced anaphylaxis. Symptoms associated with these reactions have included chest discomfort, flushing, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, throat irritation, urticaria, wheezing, and hypotension. These reactions occurred within the first hour after dosing.

Other adverse reactions indicative of hypersensitivity reactions included the following: pruritus (5%), rash (3%), and urticaria (2%).

Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after administration of KALBITOR, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials. Given the similarity in hypersensitivity symptoms and acute HAE symptoms, patients should be monitored closely in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

KALBITOR should not be administered to any patients with known clinical hypersensitivity to KALBITOR [see Contraindications (4)].

### Prescriptions for self-injectable epinephrine in emergency department angioedema management [^4c1b44ee]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Angioedema is often treated in the emergency department (ED). Few studies have evaluated self-injectable epinephrine (SIE) prescribing patterns for angioedema.

Objectives

To describe presentation and management of ED patients with angioedema and determine factors associated with epinephrine administration, hospital admission and SIE prescription.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all ED patients with angioedema between January 2005 and December 2006.

Results

Of 63 patients, 39 (61.9%) were female. Median age was 49 years. Precipitating factors were identified in 36 (57.1%) patients. History of other allergic conditions was seen in 37 (58.7%) patients. Seventeen (27.0%) patients received epinephrine, 55 (87.3%) received antihistamines, and 51 (81.0%) received steroids. Epinephrine was administered more commonly in patients with edema of the tongue (risk ratio [RR], 5.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95–14.33, P = 0.0003), tightness/fullness of throat (RR, 3.31, 95% CI 1.62–6.76, P = 0.006), and dyspnea/wheeze (RR, 3.04, 95% CI 1.41–6.59, P = 0.005). Hospitalization was more common in patients with dyspnea/wheeze (P = 0.028) and allergic history (P = 0.006). Thirteen patients (22.0%) were discharged with SIE. An SIE prescription was associated with younger patients (median age, 26 years [interquartile range (IQR) 15–50] vs a median age 57.5 years [IQR 43–68], P = 0.004) and patients with throat tightness/fullness (RR, 4.2, 95% CI 1.8–9.8, P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Patients with respiratory symptoms and allergic history were likely to be admitted. Epinephrine use was more frequent in patients with signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal edema. Younger patients and those with tightness/fullness of throat were likely to be prescribed SIE. Further studies are needed to determine who would benefit from epinephrine use and SIE prescription.

Three types of HAE have been. complication may lead to suffocation and death. The laryngeal attacks are, therefore, considered to be the most urgent sequelae of HAE, and their treatment involves airway protection with urgent use of medications aimed to decrease laryngeal swelling, as well as intubation when needed. The current therapies for HAE are generally grouped into the medications used to prevent attack occurrence and the medications used to treat an attack that has already started or is about to start.

The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Articles were included when the described study populations suffered ACEi-AE, AE with wheals (CSU), or idiopathic AE with normal C1INH. Furthermore, only articles describing pharmacological treatment of AE were included. This included both observational studies (case report and case series) and intervention trials (cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, RCTs). Any pharmacological treatment other than antihistamines up to fourfold, prednisolone, or adrenaline could be included. Articles were considered appropriate to be included only when sufficient details regarding type of treatment, dose, interval between doses, time to initial response, and time to maximum or complete response were described. Articles describing only ineffective therapies were described separately. For full understanding of scientific content by the authors who performed the selection of studies, only articles written in English, Dutch, or German were included. Recent articles for which only the title and abstract were available, such as congress abstracts, were included only if sufficient information about the patient(s), treatment regimen, and response were described. For icatibant only, when dose was missing, it was assumed that 30 mg was used due to the packaging of this product. Therefore, these articles could be included, although the dose was shown as "not reported" in the results. Articles regarding AE with wheals could only be included when treatment results specifically for AE symptoms could be extracted rather than only for the symptoms wheals and itch. Outcome measurements could differ for articles regarding an acute attack or prophylactic treatment: in acute settings, initial and complete responses refer to the resolution of a single attack of swelling, whereas in prophylactic or chronic settings this refers to a decrease in attack frequency or severity.

Studies were excluded when AE was caused by hereditary or acquired complement C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, coagulation factor 12 (fXII) mutation, formerly known as HAE type 3, or other known causes of AE, including allergy, or when AE was an adverse effect of any therapy other than ACEi.

Selection of Studies

Unique titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts were screened for eligibility. Articles published in or after 2013 were screened by at least two independent reviewers (ME, MG, and MB), results were compared, and disagreements were discussed and resolved. Articles published before 2013 were screened by one reviewer (ME), and for assessment of unclear articles only, a second reviewer (MB) was available.

There are many conditions that may present with swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the diagnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — management of orolingual angioedema associated with IV alteplase prioritizes airway protection, cessation of alteplase and ACE inhibitors, and staged medications. Maintain airway; endotracheal intubation may not be necessary if edema is limited to anterior tongue and lips, but edema involving the larynx, palate, floor of mouth, or oropharynx with rapid progression (within 30 min) poses higher risk of requiring intubation; awake fiberoptic intubation is optimal, with nasal-tracheal intubation carrying epistaxis risk after IV alteplase and cricothyroidotomy rarely needed and also problematic after IV alteplase. Discontinue IV alteplase infusion and hold ACE inhibitors. Administer IV methylprednisolone 125 mg, IV diphenhydramine 50 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg IV or famotidine 20 mg IV. If angioedema progresses, administer epinephrine (0.1%) 0.3 mL subcutaneously or by nebulizer 0.5 mL.

Use your epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector for treatment of anaphylaxis as prescribed by your healthcare provider, regardless of your medical conditions or the medicines you take.

How should I use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector?

Use your single-dose epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. You may need to use a second epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector if symptoms continue or come back while you wait for emergency help or if the first auto-injector is activated before the dose can be given. If you need more than 2 doses of epinephrine for a single anaphylaxis episode, more doses must be administered by a healthcare provider.
Epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector should be injected into the middle of your outer thigh (upper leg). It can be injected through your clothing if needed. Do not inject into a vein or into the buttocks, fingers, toes, hands or feet.
Read and make sure you understand the Instructions for Use at the end of this Patient Information leaflet to learn the right way to use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
Your healthcare provider will show you how to safely use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
It is very important that you hold the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector down firmly on the middle of the outer thigh (upper leg) for at least 3 full seconds. If you do not hold it in place long enough, the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector might not have time to deliver the correct dose of medicine.
Caution: Never put your thumb, fingers or hand over the orange needle end. Never press or push the orange needle end with your thumb, fingers or hand. The needle comes out of the orange needle end. Accidental injection into fingers, hands or feet may cause a loss of blood flow to these areas. If an accidental injection happens, go immediately to the nearest emergency room.
Warning: Do not flip the blue safety top off using a thumb or by pulling it sideways, or by bending and twisting the blue safety top. This may cause the device to activate by accident: a "pop" is heard, the orange needle end is extended and the medicine viewing window is blocked. A device that has been activated by accident cannot be used in an emergency. If this happens, replace it with a new epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
When you are ready to inject, pull the blue safety top straight up and away from the auto-injector.
Your epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector may come in a package with a gray trainer and separate Trainer Instructions for Use. The gray trainer contains no medicine and no needle. Keep the trainer and the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector away from young children. The real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector and trainer are not toys. For young children, use of the trainer and the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector should be supervised by an adult. Regularly practice with your gray trainer in non-emergency situations to make sure you can safely use the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector in an emergency. Always carry your 2 real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injectors with you in case of an allergic emergency. Additional training information is available at www.epipen.com.
Do not drop the protective case or epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector. If the protective case or auto-injector is dropped, check for damage and leakage. If damage or leakage is noticed or suspected, throw away (dispose of) the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector and protective case and replace it.

### Hereditary and acquired angioedema: problems and progress: proceedings of the third C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshop and beyond [^ad0915c2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare but life-threatening condition, manifests as acute attacks of facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling or abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), inhibitor of the first complement system component, attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis; despite availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States. The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized. This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment for all patients, and provide a platform for further research in this rare, partially understood disorder.

### Current and prospective targets of pharmacologic treatment of hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 [^8187f53d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Historical and Current Prophylactic Treatment

Treatment of HAE can be divided into two strategies: (1) treatment of acute attacks (on demand therapy; ODT) and (2) prevention of attacks, which includes short-term prophylaxis (STP) and long-term prophylaxis (LTP). It is notable that in the past the decision to initiate LTP used to be solely based on attack frequency, whereas it is nowadays very well recognized that not only burden of disease but also patient preferences should be taken into account. STP is indicated before all procedures that can induce an attack, such as (dental) surgery, endotracheal intubation and endoscopy.

In contrast to angioedema with urticaria, which is predominantly histamine-mediated, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine are ineffective in HAE. For LTP, progestins were occasionally used to inhibit the effects of estrogens which may increase FXII, PKa, and HK levels, resulting in (over) consumption of C1-INH. Progestins were reported to have a positive effect on the frequency of angioedema attacks in women with HAE. In most women they are well tolerated, but progestins carry the potential to cause breakthrough vaginal bleeding, pelvic discomfort, and mastalgia.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^c8637670]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

Discussion

Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

Conclusion

With access to targeted and effective treatments, emergency physicians are now better equipped for successful and rapid intervention in urgent HAE cases.

### Hereditary angioedema: diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^7afa8c98]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition. Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, eg, surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy, or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### Anaphylactic shock following minor abdominal trauma as the initial presentation of echinococcus cyst: a case report [^4cd75245]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Previously healthy 17-year-old female patient was admitted to the pediatric emergency department because of syncope and hypotension after walking into the classroom door at school when she had hit upper right side of her abdomen. Emergency medical services were noticed and she was transported to the ED via an ambulance. She seemed weak and confused. Her vital signs at admission were as follows: blood pressure 80/35 mmHg, heart rate 120 beats/min, temperature 38.5 °C. Her oxygen saturation on room air was 98%. Upon arrival, she demonstrated an urticarial rash mainly on her face and trunk together with angioedema of the eyelids and lips, and had severe abdominal pain, which occurred in approximately 15–20 min after the trauma. We treated her immediately with 0.5 mg intramuscular 1/1000 epinephrine for anaphylactic shock and initiated intravenous fluid resuscitation. Her response to the initial dose of epinephrine was poor, so that a repeated dosing was required after 15 min. Eventually, her blood pressure was maintained around 110/70 mmHg, approximately 10 min after the second epinephrine dose, with this treatment regime and her hemodynamic status was stabilized soon after. She also received intravenous prednisolone (50 mg) and diphenhydramine (50 mg) to prevent late reaction. Laboratory work-up revealed leukocytosis without eosinophilia and a high C-reactive protein level. Her bilirubin level was mildly elevated and she had hypoalbuminemia. The other laboratory tests were within normal limits (Table 1).

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^38003cef]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Summary of Key Criteria for the Diagnosis of HAE for Published Guidance

International/Canadian guidelines on the management of HAE were published in 2019. Although not the focus of the guideline, the guidance relating to diagnosis notes that "HAE-C1-INH should be suspected in patients who have recurrent angioedema without concomitant urticaria and also in patients who have recurrent abdominal pain for which no cause is identified, particularly if there is a family history." The authors encourage caution in patients who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as although these agents may cause angioedema, their use does not rule out underlying HAE.

Insights from an international expert panel that considered opportunities for improvement in the patient journey of people with HAE were split into (1) onset of symptoms and initial evaluation, (2) referral and diagnosis, and (3) management of HAE. Key findings were that readily available information for patients and health care providers, including emergency physicians, is lacking and that health care providers may refer patients to physicians other than allergists or immunologists, resulting in difficulties in formulating global guidance. However, several tools to aid diagnosis of patients with HAE and GI symptoms have been published since 2010. In a review of the role of the health care provider in diagnosing HAE in patients presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, the authors note that unexplained abdominal pain, particularly when accompanied by swelling of the face and extremities, suggests the diagnosis of HAE. A family history of HAE and radiologic imaging (Fig. 2) demonstrating edematous bowel can also support the diagnosis. An alphabetic mnemonic can also be used in cases where HAE is suspected, where A = angioedema, B = bradykinin, C = C1-INH, D = distress factors, E = epinephrine nonresponsive, F = family history, and G = glottis/GI edema.

### Outcomes after ecallantide treatment of laryngeal hereditary angioedema attacks [^d50263e1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder associated with episodic attacks of well-demarcated angioedema. Attacks that affect the larynx can result in life-threatening airway obstruction.

Objectives

To examine efficacy and safety of ecallantide treatment for laryngeal HAE attacks.

Methods

Data were combined from 4 clinical studies (EDEMA2, EDEMA3, EDEMA4, and DX-88/19) evaluating 30 mg of subcutaneous ecallantide for treatment of acute HAE attacks. Efficacy was assessed using 2 validated, HAE-specific, patient-reported outcome measures. The change in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score indicates change in symptom severity; a negative score indicates improvement. The calculated minimally important difference (MID) for change in severity is -0.30. The Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) measures treatment response. A positive score indicates improvement; the calculated MID is 30.

Results

Overall, 98 patients received ecallantide for 220 laryngeal attacks. The mean ± SD change in MSCS score was -1.1 ± 0.73 and -1.6 ± 0.68 at 4 and 24 hours, respectively. The mean ± SD TOS was 73.5 ± 35.8 and 85.5 ± 27.8 at 4 and 24 hours, respectively. Median time to significant improvement was 185 minutes (95% confidence interval, 167–226). One attack required intubation. Four treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported, including 2 HAE attacks that resulted in hospitalization and 2 anaphylactic reactions. One of these reactions required treatment with epinephrine, but both patients recovered fully. There were no deaths.

Conclusion

In this large attack series, ecallantide was effective for treatment of laryngeal HAE attacks. There is a risk of hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, consistent with product labeling. As such, ecallantide should be administered under the supervision of a health care professional.

Trial Registration
