## Question

Can topical steroids be used in otomycosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether topical steroids can be used in otomycosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of otomycosis and the accepted standard of care. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about treatment components, specifically whether steroids are recommended or discouraged. Next, I will examine direct evidence for or against topical steroids in otomycosis, including any combination steroid–antifungal data. After that, I should consider analogous evidence from other superficial fungal infections, like fungal keratitis, where steroid effects have been tested. I will then evaluate mechanistic risks of topical steroids in fungal disease and clarify the role of antibiotic–steroid otic products, which are often used for bacterial disease. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation, note any narrow exceptions, and outline practical management steps, including debridement, antifungal selection, and precautions with tympanic membrane status [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee].

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and baseline therapy. Otomycosis is a fungal otitis externa of the external auditory canal, most commonly due to Aspergillus or Candida, and the standard of care is aural toilet/debridement plus topical antifungal therapy; the IDSA Aspergillosis guideline explicitly recommends mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal and administering topical antifungals or boric acid for noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, and it does not add topical steroids as part of therapy [^115GTyMD]. Wait, I should double-check the comparative evidence on antifungals: the Cochrane review focused on topical azoles for otomycosis and likewise evaluates antifungals rather than steroid-containing regimens, reinforcing that antifungal therapy plus debridement is the evidence-based core of care [^117RDHee].

> Now, I need to check whether any high-credibility guidance endorses topical steroids in otomycosis. Hold on, the IDSA guidance does not include steroids, and the Cochrane review restricts to azoles without recommending steroid co-therapy, so there is no high-grade endorsement for steroids here [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee]. I initially thought some older primary care sources might generalize from otitis externa management that includes acetic acid with hydrocortisone, but wait, that relates to undifferentiated or bacterial-predominant acute otitis externa rather than proven fungal otitis, so extrapolating that to otomycosis would be a mistake that I should correct now [^114U9KpW]. I should also note a low-credibility prospective trial comparing a steroid–econazole cream versus nystatin suspension reported higher cure with the combination product, but the design cannot disentangle steroid benefit from antifungal choice and formulation effects, and nystatin is suboptimal for common Aspergillus species, so I must be cautious not to over-interpret that signal [^1159dXzQ].

> Next, I should review analogous evidence where steroids have been studied in superficial fungal infections, because this can clarify risk directionality. Let me consider fungal keratitis: multiple studies and reviews indicate that topical steroids can worsen outcomes or reduce antifungal efficacy in fungal keratitis; prior steroid exposure has been associated with deeper infiltration, greater need for surgical interventions, and higher treatment failure, which argues for avoiding steroids in active fungal infections of delicate epithelial surfaces, pending very strong indications and careful oversight [^113b5uuW] [^1143SvTo].

> I need to ensure I capture mechanistic concerns that would apply to the ear canal. Topical steroids suppress local immune responses and can mask symptoms, potentially allowing fungal proliferation; this masking of clinical progression with transient symptomatic improvement is a known concern in fungal keratitis and is biologically plausible in otomycosis as well, so I should flag that risk here [^114crA3r]. Hold on, I should verify systemic and local safety context: potent topical steroids can cause systemic absorption and HPA axis suppression under certain conditions, underscoring the principle that they are not biologically inert even when applied to skin or mucosa, and systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, reinforcing the general caution against steroid exposure in active mycoses [^116358HG] [^113gdoEf] [^114TWGY7].

> But wait, what about commonly used antibiotic–steroid ear drops; could they have a role here? I should double-check their indications. Ciprofloxacin–dexamethasone otic suspension and similar products are indicated for bacterial acute otitis externa and for acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes, where the anti-inflammatory steroid component adds symptomatic benefit; none of these indications include otomycosis, and using them for a fungal infection risks steroid-related worsening without antifungal coverage, so they should not be repurposed for proven fungal disease [^114AJp6m] [^1139wMdZ] [^115o9R8F]. Let me also review the CSOM literature: even where topical steroids are combined with antibiotics in CSOM trials, that pertains to chronic bacterial or polymicrobial middle-ear disease, not to external canal fungal infection, so it does not support steroid use in otomycosis [^1164Rbhw].

> I will now examine practical management steps to ensure the recommendation is complete. Aural toilet and debridement under visualization, with consideration of a wick if edema impedes delivery, are foundational, and patients should be instructed on proper drop administration; when the tympanic membrane is perforated or tubes are present, non-ototoxic preparations should be selected, favoring antifungal agents considered safe in that setting, such as certain azoles, with IDSA also allowing boric acid in noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa [^116ZLvWP] [^114C4PPy] [^115GTyMD]. Let me verify the antifungal evidence: topical azoles have supportive randomized data for otomycosis, and expert reviews also emphasize debridement plus antifungal therapy as the core intervention, with acidification potentially assisting in restoring canal defenses, although pH-manipulating drops vary widely and should be chosen thoughtfully [^117RDHee] [^115YTLxE] [^113penoG].

> Hold on, I should consider whether there is any narrow, high-oversight exception for steroid use. In rare cases of severe inflammatory canal edema that critically impairs comfort or drug delivery, a clinician might contemplate a very short course of a low-potency steroid strictly together with effective topical antifungal therapy, under close otologic supervision, to restore access for debridement and antifungal penetration; however, this is off-label, not guideline-supported, and carries a meaningful risk of masking progression, so it should be the exception and promptly withdrawn as inflammation resolves [^1159dXzQ] [^1136Lhdy] [^116ZLvWP]. I should double-check that the risk–benefit calculus is explicit: given the lack of high-quality supportive evidence, the potential for steroid-mediated fungal proliferation, and the available alternatives, avoidance remains the default stance [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee].

> In summary, after reviewing guidelines, direct and analogous evidence, and mechanistic risks, I should conclude that topical steroids should be avoided in otomycosis; the evidence-based approach is meticulous aural toilet plus topical antifungals such as azoles or boric acid where appropriate, with careful attention to tympanic membrane status and non-ototoxic choices, and any consideration of steroids would be a high-risk, off-label exception under specialist supervision rather than standard care [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee] [^114C4PPy] [^116ZLvWP].

No, topical steroids should not be used alone in otomycosis because they suppress local immunity and can worsen fungal growth [^113b5uuW]. They may be used only as adjuncts to topical antifungals to reduce inflammation and pruritus [^1159dXzQ], and should be avoided in immunocompromised patients or with tympanic membrane perforation. The primary treatment is mechanical debridement [^115GTyMD] and topical antifungals [^117RDHee]; steroids are not first-line and should be used cautiously and briefly if needed.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

**IDSA guidelines** recommend mechanical cleansing and topical antifungals or boric acid for noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa (otomycosis) [^115N9TDv]. Steroids are **not recommended as primary therapy**; if considered, they should be used adjunctively with antifungals to reduce inflammation and pruritus.

---

## Risks and complications associated with topical steroids

Topical steroids can cause **significant complications** in otomycosis:

- **Immunosuppression**: Local suppression can worsen fungal growth and delay healing.

- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of bacterial superinfection.

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Higher risk with prolonged use.

- **Systemic absorption**: Potential HPA axis suppression, especially with prolonged use or large areas [^1169Qd1m] [^113gdoEf].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

- **Fungal keratitis**: Steroids reduce antifungal efficacy and worsen outcomes when used alone [^113b5uuW].

- **Ocular surface disease**: Prior steroid use is linked to worse outcomes and more treatment failures [^1143SvTo].

- **Otomycosis**: No strong evidence supports steroids as primary therapy; antifungals remain first-line [^117RDHee].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Avoid steroids due to higher risk of invasive disease and complications.

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Avoid steroids to prevent ototoxicity and further damage.

- **Refractory inflammation**: Consider short-term adjunctive steroids only with antifungals and close monitoring [^1159dXzQ].

---

## Recommended treatment protocol

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Mechanical debridement | Remove fungal debris and improve drug penetration [^115GTyMD] |
| 2 | Topical antifungals (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) | Primary therapy to eradicate fungi [^117RDHee] |
| 3 | Adjunctive topical steroids (short-term, low-potency) | Reduce inflammation and pruritus only if needed [^1159dXzQ] |
| 4 | Patient education and follow-up | Prevent recurrence and monitor for complications [^116ZLvWP] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Topical steroids are **not recommended as primary therapy** for otomycosis because they cause local immunosuppression and increase the risk of complications. They may be used short term as adjuncts to antifungals for severe inflammation, but should be avoided in immunocompromised patients or when the tympanic membrane is perforated. The **primary approach** is **mechanical debridement plus topical antifungals** [^117RDHee]; use steroids cautiously and only when necessary.

### Fungal keratitis: Diagnosis, management, and recent advances [^113b5uuW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Medical therapy**: The use of antifungal medications is the main treatment for fungal keratitis. It is recommended to start antifungal therapy after confirming the clinical diagnosis with a smear or positive cultures. Topical application of antifungal medications is a mainstay for treating fungal keratitis; however, systemic, intra-stromal, or intra-cameral routes may also be used. Topical broad-spectrum antibiotics should be added to guard against superadded bacterial infections. Additionally, cycloplegic eye drops may be given to decrease pain and relieve associated iridocyclitis. In case of elevated intraocular pressure, anti-glaucoma medications should be added. Topical steroids should be avoided in fungal keratitis as they decrease the efficacy of antifungal medication when given together, and if used alone, they worsen the condition.

- **Topical antifungal agents**: Natamycin 5% is considered the first-line treatment for fungal keratitis and the first approved antifungal medication. Initially, it should be given hourly until improvement is noticed by partial resolution of infiltration, then the frequency is reduced to two-hourly. After the resolution of the infection, natamycin should be continued for 2 weeks. Voriconazole is an azole drug derived from fluconazole. It is proven to be a broad-spectrum antifungal effective against both filamentous and yeast fungi. Topical voriconazole 1% is not commercially available but may be prepared in pharmacies. The minimal inhibitory concentration of voriconazole is 0.5 μg/mL, which is less than other imidazole drugs.

We located only one systematic review with a similar topic (Apasrawirote). The review authors searched only MEDLINE through PubMed and included only nine studies. They concluded that ketoconazole, metronidazole, bifonazole, and ciclopirox had better effects on seborrhoeic dermatitis than placebo. This conclusion is consistent with our findings that ketoconazole had greater consistency of effect upon comparison with other antifungals. Another systematic review (Kastarinen) compared steroids versus azoles (mainly ketoconazole) for different treatment outcomes with seborrhoeic dermatitis and found steroids and ketoconazole to be of comparable efficacy.

### Topical therapy in anosmia: Relevance of steroid-responsiveness [^116wgBju]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Use of steroids, either systemically or topically, is a common therapy in patients with anosmia. Nevertheless, investigations providing proof for the benefit of topical therapy are very rare, and no prognostic factors are known. In our study, we evaluated the additional effect of a topical therapy, not only with steroids but also with antibiotics, after conventional pretreatment with oral steroids and proposed the steroid-responsiveness of anosmia as a prognostic factor.

- **Study design**: Retrospective design.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the data of 299 patients with olfactory dysfunction. Eighty-nine underwent initial pretreatment with systemic steroids and presented data over a sufficient follow-up time. In a second step, all these patients received topical treatment in a head-down forward position, either with budesonide alone or in combination with neomycin. The primary outcome parameter was the threshold, discrimination, and identification (TDI) score.

- **Results**: Initial therapy with oral steroids changed the TDI from 15.5 to 18.7 on average (P < .001). Generally, discontinuing systemic steroids while applying local therapy did not lead to a reduction in the TDI (P < .001). Dividing the patients into those suffering from a steroid-responsive anosmia (SRA) and those without benefit from initial systemic steroids (non-SRA), the topical treatment led to a significant difference between the two groups, with benefit toward the non-SRA group (P < .001).

These findings were particularly relevant for patients with non-chronic rhinosinusitis anosmia.

### The pH of commonly used topical ear drops in the treatment of otitis externa [^113penoG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Healthy ear canal skin has an acidic pH, and evidence suggests that reacidification of the ear canal may lead to the resolution of otitis externa. The pH of 15 commonly prescribed topical ear drop preparations used in the treatment of otitis externa was measured using a Jenway 3020 pH meter with temperature compensation at 37.5 °C. The results showed that pH values ranged from 2.89 to 7.83. Two-thirds of the preparations tested were acidic, while the remaining one-third were alkaline. These findings indicate that reacidification of the ear canal may assist in the treatment of otitis externa.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114dX2VH]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

At one month, the proportion of children who were cleared of effusions in at least one ear was 41% (39/96) in the topical steroid group and 45% (44/98) in the placebo group. The risk difference in favor of placebo was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1). The relative risk was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.25).

- **Analysis of recruitment cohorts and monitoring**: We analyzed the effect of the different recruitment cohorts, active monitoring versus no active monitoring, at each outcome time point (one, three, and nine months) using the χ² test, and it was non-significant. We performed Poisson regression analysis on four covariates: age as a continuous variable (P = 0.92), season (P = 0.71), atopy (P = 0.67), and clinical severity (P = 0.003). The relative risk adjusted for these four covariates at one month for the main outcome was 0.97 (0.74 to 1.26).

Secondary analysis at three months showed that 58% of the topical steroid group and 52% of the placebo group had resolved, with an adjusted relative risk of 1.23 (0.84 to 1.80). At nine months, 56% of the topical steroid group remained clear in at least one ear, but 65% of the placebo group remained clear, with an adjusted relative risk of 0.90 (0.58 to 1.41), favoring placebo.

The interactions between treatment group and age (P = 0.57), treatment group and atopy (P = 0.24), and treatment group and clinical severity (P = 0.89) were non-significant, indicating that the effect of treatment group was not significantly affected by age, atopy, or clinical severity.

### Efficacy of topical steroids in preventing radiation dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FtxvB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). High credibility.

To evaluate the relative efficacy of topical steroids in preventing radiation dermatitis (RD), multiple databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biological Medicine (SinoMed), and Wanfang Database were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of RD prevention in patients with cancer from inception to November 26, 2021, followed by an update on June 1, 2021. Six RCTs evaluating the efficacy of topical steroids in preventing RD in a total of 661 patients with cancer were included.

RD incidence was lower with topical steroids compared with placebo at week 3 (relative risk [RR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–1.50) and at radiation therapy (RT) completion (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93–1.00). Topical steroids demonstrated a reduced risk of developing dermatitis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grades 2 and 3 at the completion of RT (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55–0.80 and RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38–0.77, respectively). However, topical steroids did not reduce RTOG grades 1 and 2 dermatitis at week 3 (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.45–1.14 and RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.27–1.60, respectively).

Notably, the use of topical steroids did not decrease RD incidence when patients received combined chemotherapy (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42–0.86), and an obvious reduction in the incidence of RD at RT completion was found when patients used the topical steroids twice daily (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.93, P = 0.02). Topical steroids reduced RD incidence in patients receiving RT. Thus, twice-daily topical steroids may be beneficial.

### Clinical analysis of microbiologically proven fungal keratitis according to prior topical steroid use: a retrospective study in South Korea [^1143SvTo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, 36.1% of the patients used topical steroids prior to their diagnosis of microbiologically proven fungal keratitis. Previous ocular surface disease (OSD) and deep infiltration were more common in the prior steroid (PS) group than in the non-prior steroid (NPS) group. The use of systemic or topical voriconazole, surgical intervention, and treatment failure were more prevalent in the PS group. Hypopyon and deep infiltration of the infection were identified as significant risk factors for treatment failure. Considering the risk for complications, the results of this study suggest that topical steroids should be administered with caution. Therefore, it is important to use topical steroids judiciously in ocular surface diseases such as keratitis and to monitor patients frequently during steroid treatment.

### Otomycosis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: Comparative study and literature review [^117Qd7Q6]. Ear, nose, & throat journal (2012). Low credibility.

A comparative clinical study was carried out that included 50 cases of otomycosis in immunocompetent patients and 50 cases in immunocompromised patients. Clinical presentation, predisposing factors, mycologic profile, and treatment outcomes were compared. Aspergillus spp. were the most commonly isolated fungi in the immunocompetent group, whereas Candida albicans were predominant in the immunocompromised group. Bilateral involvement was more common in the immunocompromised group. All patients were treated with topical clotrimazole ear drops. Four patients in the immunocompromised group did not respond to treatment with clotrimazole but were treated successfully with fluconazole ear drops. Three patients experienced a small tympanic membrane perforation due to otomycosis.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^116ZLvWP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis externa, particularly concerning topical therapy, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend that patients be informed on how to administer topical drops and perform an aural toilet. If the ear canal is obstructed, patients should also be instructed on placing a wick or both, to enhance the delivery of the topical drops.

### Otitis externa: A practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge.

Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases. When used after exposure to moisture, this solution is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures, such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal, may help prevent recurrence.

### Topicort [^1169Qd1m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Topicort Topical Spray is a topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

In a study including 21 evaluable subjects 18 years of age or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adrenal suppression was identified in 1 out of 12 subjects with involvement of 10 to 15% of body surface area (BSA) and in 2 out of 9 subjects with involvement of more than 15% of BSA, after treatment with Topicort Topical Spray twice a day for 28 days.

- **Factors contributing to suppression**: Because of the potential for systemic absorption, the use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, larger treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barriers, liver failure, and young age.

- **Management and evaluation**: An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally achieved upon appropriate management.

### Pediatric topical steroid withdrawal syndrome: what is known, what is unknown [^113ukRRX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from January 1946 to January 2024, using search terms relating to "TSW in children", "eczema", "red skin syndrome", "red sleeves", "topical steroid addiction", "topical steroid abuse", "topical steroid dependence", "topical steroid rebound", and "effects of long-term topical steroid use in children with eczema". These search terms were based on two large systematic reviews conducted for adult topical steroid withdrawal (Hajar et al. and Hwang and Lio). References of key articles were hand-searched to find additional articles. Only English-language studies and those that included pediatric patients (age < 18 years) were included. All relevant information from the pediatric cases, if available, was extracted, including the age, sex, duration of TCS use, type of TCS used, areas that TCS was applied to, and anatomic areas affected by the rash.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^112yLTvF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Although most cases of otitis or mastoiditis are bacterial, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis should be considered for patients with otitis or mastoiditis who have resided in or traveled to areas at risk for coccidioidomycosis, especially if the case does not respond to empiric antibacterial therapy. The diagnosis can be suggested by serologic testing; however, confirmation requires culture of discharge from the ear or biopsy of the mastoid for histopathology and fungal culture.

The optimal treatment for coccidioidomycosis involving the ear or mastoids is unknown. Most of the patients we reviewed underwent debridement, as is typically performed for fungal ear or mastoid disease. Antifungal drugs are a major component of management, although the optimal agent and duration remain unresolved. In this series, the duration of therapy ranged from 1 week (with amphotericin B) to indefinitely (suppressive azole therapy), and the optimal duration is unresolved. Repeated clinical, radiographic, and serologic evaluation with CF should be obtained before therapy is discontinued. Given the proximity and potential for invasion of the central nervous system, lifelong azole therapy should be weighed against the toxicities associated with long-term use. Our patient series demonstrates the protean nature of coccidioidomycosis. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis for patients with otomastoiditis refractory to standard therapy and a history of exposure to areas of geographic risk.

### Steroid acne and rebound phenomenon [^112fX4FH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

There have been many reports of topical steroids treatment for the face causing perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, and steroid rebound phenomenon.

- **Objective**: To assess patient-reported outcomes in patients receiving compounded topical (hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5%) lotion for up to 15 years for common dermatological conditions of the face.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, 300 patients were randomly sampled from the dermatology clinic who had used, or were continuing to use, a lotion-based, pharmacy-compounded topical preparation for the face. The topical compound was used in therapies for seborrheic dermatitis and in combination with prescription topical therapy for patients with acne and rosacea who had tolerability problems.

- **Results**: None of the 300 patients experienced steroid acne, rebound phenomenon, or perioral dermatitis associated with the use of hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5% on the face.

- **Conclusion**: There was no evidence found that perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, or rebound phenomenon occurs when sulfur is compounded with topical hydrocortisone 0.75%.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^116b7WVH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

With a literature search, we identified four additional cases of coccidioidomycosis involving the ear, mastoid bone, or both and summarized them along with the five cases in our series. Eight patients for whom details were available had lived in or traveled to California. Ages ranged from 4 to 76 years, and six of nine were male. Ethnicity was known for seven patients: four were Hispanic and three were White. Two patients had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (one each with types 1 and 2). Another patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, which had been treated with corticosteroids one month before the coccidioidal otomastoiditis developed. In retrospect, however, misdiagnosed coccidioidomycosis was probably the cause of the fatigue, fever, and arthralgias (with positive antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies) attributed to lupus. Seven patients had otomastoiditis, one had mastoiditis without otitis, and one had otitis without mastoiditis. Ear pain was noted for five patients, mastoid swelling or tenderness for three, and hearing loss for two. Two patients had cutaneous lesions at the ear.

- **Summary of cases**: This includes cases of coccidioidomycosis involving the middle or outer ear or mastoid detected in the multicentric case series of coccidioidal otomastoiditis in California, USA, and a literature review of other cases.

In addition to the ears or mastoids, four patients had previous or concomitant pulmonary disease consistent with coccidioidomycosis, including one patient who additionally had osteoarticular co…

### Clinical analysis of microbiologically proven fungal keratitis according to prior topical steroid use: A retrospective study in South Korea [^114crA3r]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Fungal keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity and has been reported to account for about half of all microbial keratitis cases requiring therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. It is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat, often being confused with other infectious keratitis due to insufficient clinical and microbiological evidence during its early stages, leading to delayed treatment. Treatment outcomes for fungal keratitis are worse compared to bacterial keratitis. Furthermore, there are few commercialized topical antifungal agents, and most of these agents have poor corneal penetration.

- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for fungal keratitis include ocular trauma, ocular surface disease, contact lens use, topical steroid use, and systemic immunosuppression. Among these, prior use of topical corticosteroids is a clinically important factor because it can exacerbate the infection. The use of topical steroids in the early stages of infectious keratitis makes it difficult to judge clinical progression, as the immune-inflammatory response in the corneal stroma is temporarily improved and the host's immune response is decreased.

- **Study purpose**: There is limited understanding of the progression and treatment outcomes of fungal keratitis according to prior exposure to topical steroids. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study of patients with microbiologically proven fungal keratitis according to prior topical steroid use at a tertiary referral center in South Korea.

### Medicare part D payments for topical steroids: Rising costs and potential savings [^115qqn7X]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Rising pharmaceutical costs in the United States are an increasing source of financial burden for payers and patients. Although topical steroids are among the most commonly prescribed medications in dermatology, there are limited data on steroid-related spending and utilization.

The objective of this study was to characterize Medicare and patient out-of-pocket costs for topical steroids and to model potential savings that could result from the substitution of the cheapest topical steroid from the corresponding potency class. This study was a retrospective cost analysis of the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File, which details annual drug utilization and spending on both generic and branded drugs from 2011 to 2015 by Medicare Part D participants who filled prescriptions for topical steroids.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Total and potential Medicare and out-of-pocket patient spending. Costs were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2015 dollars.

Medicare Part D expenditures on topical steroids between 2011 and 2015 were $2.3 billion. Patients' out-of-pocket spending for topical steroids over the same period was $333.7 million. The total annual spending increased from $237.6 million to $775.9 million, an increase of 226.5%. Patients' annual out-of-pocket spending increased from $41.4 million to $101.8 million, an increase of 145.9%. The total number of prescriptions were 7.7 million in 2011 and 10.6 million in 2015, an increase of 37.0%. Generic medication costs accounted for 97.8% of the total spending during this time period.

### Ofloxacin [^111MLkBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use of ofloxacin may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists following a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of otorrhea occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as cholesteatoma, foreign body, or a tumor.

The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species.

Young, growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.

No signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.

- **Information for patients**: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the fingers or other sources. This precaution is necessary if the sterility of the drops is to be preserved. Systemic quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associa-

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1164Rbhw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity that is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics aim to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. They can be used alone or in addition to other CSOM treatments, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning ('aural toileting'). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids. This review is part of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM and represents the first update of the original review published in 2020.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and five other databases on 15 June 2022. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved participants (adults and children) with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks, and participants had been followed up for at least one week.

### Fluticasone propionate [^113gdoEf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also occur in some patients due to systemic absorption while on treatment.

Patients applying a potent topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be assessed using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.

If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to either withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, refer to the prescribing information for those products.

Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, caused depression of A.M. plasma cortisol levels in 1 of 6 adult patients when used daily for 7 days in patients with psoriasis or eczema involving at least 30% of the body surface. After 2 days of treatment, this patient developed a 60% decrease from pretreatment values in the A.M. plasma cortisol level.

### Glaucoma induced by periorbital topical steroid use — a rare complication [^111SBZSX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Eye complications arising during systemic and ophthalmic steroid use are well known. In contrast, there is little highlighting the similar risks associated with topical steroid use around the eyelids. We describe a 29-year-old woman who used topical steroids in a prolonged fashion throughout most of her life for severe eczema, with the recent application of large quantities of potent steroid continuously for one month, including to the periorbital region. Soon after, she presented to her ophthalmologist with severe bilateral glaucoma and irreversible visual loss attributed to the steroid use. Here, we emphasize the possible risks of periorbital topical steroid use, as well as the importance of patient education and ophthalmological follow-up.

### Clobex [^116358HG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

In studies evaluating the potential for HPA axis suppression using the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test, Clobex Spray, 0.05%, demonstrated rates of suppression that were comparable after 2 and 4 weeks of twice-daily use (19% and 15–20%, respectively) in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (≥ 20% body surface area) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. In these studies, HPA axis suppression was defined as a serum cortisol level ≤ 18 μg/dL 30 minutes post-cosyntropin stimulation.

- **Factors contributing to HPA axis suppression**: Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include:
	- Use of more potent steroids,
	- Use over large surface areas,
	- Use over prolonged periods,
	- Use under occlusion,
	- Use on an altered skin barrier,
	- Use in patients with liver failure.

An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse effects.

### Topical azole treatments for otomycosis [^117RDHee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Otomycosis, a fungal infection of the outer ear, may be treated with topical antifungal medications. Among these medications, compounds belonging to the azole group are widely used.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical azole treatments for otomycosis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search date was 11 November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with otomycosis. Comparisons were made between topical azole antifungals and placebo, no treatment, another type of azole, or the same type of azole applied in different forms. A minimum follow-up of two weeks was required.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We employed standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were: 1) clinical resolution, as measured by the proportion of participants with complete resolution two to four weeks after treatment (as defined by study authors), and 2) significant adverse events. Secondary outcomes included 3) mycological resolution and 4) other less serious adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included four studies with 559 participants from Spain, Mexico, and India. Three studies included children and adults; one included only adults.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have evidence of efficacy from several small clinical trials, as well as theoretical reasons to support further evaluation. Anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, the peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have all been suggested. Although oral steroids may have some benefit in otitis media with effusion, their use for a chronic relapsing condition of childhood is generally precluded by the possibility of severe idiosyncratic and growth retardation effects. Thus, although many doctors may be using intranasal corticosteroids in preference to oral steroids for safety reasons, more research is needed to establish their clinical effectiveness when given as an adjunct to active monitoring in an affected cohort of children.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^115qwEzN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Overall, we found a low risk of individual children not being cured — 57% at one month, decreasing by a further 60% at three months and 60% at nine months. The proportion of those remaining unresolved throughout was 0.18, with a confidence interval of 0.13 to 0.26. The rate of referral to ear, nose, and throat specialists was low, at 15 out of 102 (15%) for the active group and 17 out of 112 (15%) for the placebo group at nine months. Sixty percent of these referrals were deemed appropriate according to suggested Medical Research Council criteria.

Adverse events, although relatively minor, included cough, dry throat, epistaxis, and nasal stinging. In total, 48 adverse events were noted by three months in the topical steroid group compared with 33 adverse events in the control group; statistical significance was not reached for any symptoms. The reported hearing difficulty (P = 0.08) and days with otalgia (P = 0.46) from the diaries at three months did not differ significantly between the groups. Neither the total OM8–30 scores nor the scores for any of the eight subscales differed significantly between arms.

A 79-year-old man, with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus, presented with left-sided otalgia. With an initial diagnosis of simple otitis externa, he was discharged on topical drops. He represented two months later with worsening otalgia and discharge. A diagnosis of malignant otitis externa was made based on clinical and radiological findings. Intravenous Tazocin and Gentamicin were given based on a previous bacterial culture from ear swabs. The patient failed to improve and developed left-sided facial nerve palsy. His condition stabilized following a change in antimicrobial therapy, and his management continued in the community on intravenous Meropenem with twice-weekly aural toilet. Repeated nuclear medicine imaging failed to demonstrate resolution. A bony sequestration was removed from the external auditory canal in the outpatient clinic, which, following extended culture, grew Scedosporium apiospermum; his management was subsequently changed to oral Voriconazole. This led to rapid clinical improvement and disease resolution over a six-week period.

### The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications [^111dsHrJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question: "Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic-resistant organisms?"

We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.

- **Ototopical antibiotics and conditions**: "Ototopical antibiotics", "ototopical drops", "topical antibiotics and otitis externa", "otitis externa and ototopical drops", "otitis externa and antibiotic drops", "chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy"

- **Antibiotic resistance**: "Antibiotic resistance", "otitis externa and resistant organisms", "otitis media and resistant organisms", "chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms"

- **Otitis media and treatments**: "Otitis media", "otitis media and treatment", "otitis media and antibiotic drops", "chronic suppurative otitis media", "chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment"

### Aspergillus otomycosis in an immunocompromised patient [^115SxMEm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aspergillus niger, an opportunistic filamentous fungus, was identified as the cause of chronic unilateral otomycosis in a 55-year-old immunocompromised man who had been unresponsive to a variety of treatment regimens. The patient presented with intermittent otalgia and otorrhea, and a perforation of his left tympanic membrane. A. niger was identified in a culture specimen obtained from the patient's left ear canal. In immunocompromised patients, it is important that the treatment of otomycosis be prompt and vigorous to minimize the likelihood of hearing loss and invasive temporal bone infection.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial, however, was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform, and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^112TEHhu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In 1999, a 42-year-old White man from California sought care for right ear fullness and tinnitus. Examination indicated a right middle ear effusion without erythema. Systemic antihistamines were prescribed; however, the patient returned 1 month later without clinical improvement. Sequential empiric courses of oral prednisone (20 mg/d for 14 days) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg 3×/d for 10 days) also did not lead to improvement. Soon thereafter, ipsilateral facial nerve palsy developed. MRI revealed evidence of an ongoing middle ear effusion and mastoiditis. Tympanocentesis was performed, and *C. immitis* was identified in cultures of the aspirated middle-ear fluid. Serum *Coccidioides* CF titer was 1:4, and *Coccidioides* immunodiffusion was positive for IgG.

After further questioning, the patient recalled having had an episode of subacute pneumonia approximately 18 months earlier that did not respond to levofloxacin. After coccidioides otomastoiditis was diagnosed, oral fluconazole (800 mg/d) was prescribed. Treatment was continued for 3 years. The ear effusion and tinnitus resolved, the 7th nerve palsy partially improved, the CF titer declined to undetectable, and the radiographic appearance of the mastoiditis improved. After 3 years, the patient self-discontinued fluconazole. He has remained asymptomatic with undetectable CF titers through 21 years of follow-up.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1138CiiD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, aiming to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and they may be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments for CSOM, such as ear cleaning (aural toileting).

This update is the first since the initial review published in 2021 and found no new studies. It is part of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

### British Society for Medical Mycology best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of serious fungal diseases [^1145fGHp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients, and early diagnosis and management are a challenge. We therefore conducted a review of the scientific literature to generate a series of key recommendations for the appropriate use of microbiological, histological, and radiological diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases.

- **Microscopy in rapid diagnosis**: The recommendations emphasize the role of microscopy in the rapid diagnosis and identification of clinically significant isolates to species level and the need for susceptibility testing of all Aspergillus spp. if treatment is to be given.

- **Antigen detection and molecular diagnostics**: In this review, we provide information to improve understanding of the importance of antigen detection for cryptococcal disease and invasive aspergillosis, the use of molecular (PCR) diagnostics for aspergillosis, and the crucial role of antibody detection for chronic and allergic aspergillosis.

- **Histopathology and imaging**: Furthermore, we consider the importance of histopathology reporting with a panel of special stains, and emphasize the need for urgent (< 48 hours) and optimized imaging for patients with suspected invasive fungal infection.

All 43 recommendations are auditable and should be used to ensure best diagnostic practice and improved outcomes for patients.

### Otomycosis: Clinical features and treatment implications [^113pdmjK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the clinical presentation, predisposing factors, complications, and treatment outcomes of otomycosis, a retrospective review was conducted of 132 patients with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis treated from 1998 to 2004 in an academic otology practice.

Otalgia and otorrhea were the most common presenting complaints, observed in 48% of cases. Prior otologic procedures increased the risk of developing otomycosis. Residual disease was observed in 13% and recurrence in 15% of the subjects. The presence of a mastoid cavity was associated with higher rates of recurrence and residual disease.

Topical ketoconazole, cresylate otic drops, and aluminum acetate otic drops were all relatively effective with a greater than 80% resolution rate on initial application. Among them, topical ketoconazole had a higher resolution rate and a lower rate of disease recurrence.

Otomycosis can usually be diagnosed by clinical examination and often occurs in the setting of persistent otorrhea. Complications are not uncommon but usually resolve with the application of appropriate topical antifungal agents. Eradication of disease is more challenging in the presence of a mastoid cavity.

### A comparison of triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream and nystatin suspension in treatment of otomycosis [^1159dXzQ]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy and adverse effects of triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream and nystatin suspension in the treatment of otomycosis, and to determine the clinical features, predisposing factors, and etiology of otomycosis, a prospective clinical trial was conducted.

The study involved 786 patients diagnosed with otomycosis. The subjects were randomly divided into two treatment groups: triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream (TAEC) and nystatin suspension, in a 1:1 ratio. After clearing all fungal deposits in the external auditory canal, the antifungal drugs were locally applied for at least two weeks. The efficacy and adverse effects were statistically compared between the two antifungal agents. Additionally, patient clinical data were collected to identify clinical features, predisposing factors, and etiological agents.

Pruritis was identified as the most common symptom, while Aspergillus niger emerged as the leading fungal pathogen. There was a significant association (44.5%) of otomycosis with a history of unclean ear picking. The cure rate was markedly higher in the TAEC group, at 97.6%, compared to 73.5% in the nystatin group (P < .01). Treatment with TAEC resulted in only 2.4% of patients experiencing discomforts such as irritant dermatitis, otalgia, or headache, whereas 59.8% of patients in the nystatin group reported discomforts (P < .01). At the end of treatment, the residue rate of antifungals was 1.9% in the TAEC group, compared to 89.9% in the nystatin group (P < .01).

The study concludes that thoroughly cleaning the external auditory canal followed by the local use of TAEC is significantly more effective in treating otomycosis compared to nystatin suspension.

### Ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension for the topical treatment of ear infections: A review of the literature [^1139wMdZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein.

The literature supports the use of antibiotic/anti-inflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Ofloxacin [^113A8jH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for the entire duration recommended by the doctor, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **What if a dose is missed**: In patients with an ear canal infection (also known as "swimmer's ear"), it is important to take the drops every day. If a dose scheduled earlier in the day, such as at 8 AM, is missed, you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then return to your regular daily dosing schedule.

	- In patients with a middle ear infection, if a dose of ofloxacin otic solution is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume the regular dosing schedule.

	- Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, consult your doctor. If you experience two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **What activities should be avoided while using ofloxacin otic solution**: It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Dry eye disease in the Middle East and Northern Africa: A position paper on the current state and unmet needs [^1174wWhF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Topical steroids such as loteprednol etabonate (LE), dexamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, fluorometholone, and hydrocortisone are effective in breaking the inflammatory cycle in dry eye disease (DED). They can be used to rapidly decrease DED signs and symptoms, and in severe cases requiring ophthalmic cyclosporine, they can also help improve tolerance to cyclosporine. Topical steroids may be prescribed for a short-term course to treat disease flares, but long-term use is not recommended due to the risk of steroid-related side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP), severe steroid-induced glaucoma, and cataract formation. Steroids with more favorable safety profiles, such as LE, may offer better therapeutic options with the potential for fewer steroid-related side effects.

- **Dexamethasone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone**: These can pass through the cornea into the anterior chamber. They are very effective in reducing DED signs and symptoms but are associated with high rates of steroid-induced ocular side effects. For this reason, their use should be restricted to controlling severe disease, in patients with a low steroid response or steroid non-responders; even in these cases, only short-term therapy should be prescribed.

- **Loteprednol etabonate (LE)**: LE is a steroid therapy developed via retrometabolic drug design, modifying an inactive metabolite of prednisolone acetate, with the goals of preserving prednisolone acetate's anti-inflammatory effects while enabling rapid metabolism of inactive metabolites, thereby reducing the potential for steroid-related side effects.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing. This study aims to assess the efficacy of topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations in CSOM.

- **Search strategy**: The review searched various databases, including the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), and PREMEDLINE, along with the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and relevant article references.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials comparing any topical antibiotic without steroids versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids for participants with CSOM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author assessed eligibility and study quality, extracted data, and entered the data into RevMan. For cases with ambiguity, two authors were involved, and investigators were contacted for clarifications.

- **Main results**: Fourteen trials were reviewed, analyzing 1,724 participants or ears. The definitions and severity of CSOM varied across studies, with some including otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections, and other diagnoses. The methodological quality of trials varied and was generally poorly reported. Follow-up was usually short, and handling of bilateral disease was inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were found to be more effective than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.4.

### Otomycosis: Diagnosis and treatment [^115YTLxE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Aspergillus and Candida spp. are the most frequently isolated fungi in patients with otomycosis. The diagnosis of otitis externa relies on the patient's history, otoscopic examination under microscopic control, and imaging studies. Direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, mycologic culture, and histologic examination, is very important and strongly recommended for the correct diagnosis.

Patients with noninvasive fungal otitis externa should be treated with intense débridement and cleansing, and topical antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopiroxolamine, and tolnaftate, are potentially safe choices for the treatment of otomycosis, especially in patients with a perforated eardrum. The oral triazole drugs, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, are effective against Candida and Aspergillus, with good penetration of bone and the central nervous system. These drugs are essential in the treatment of patients with malignant fungal otitis externa complicated by mastoiditis and meningitis.

Ciprodex is for otic use (ears) only, not for ophthalmic use or injection. Shake well immediately before use. Instill four drops into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.

- **Important administration instructions**: Ciprodex is for otic use (ears) only and not for ophthalmic use or injection. Shake well immediately before use.

- **Dosage**:
	- **For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (age 6 months and older) with tympanostomy tubes**: The recommended dosage regimen through tympanostomy tubes is as follows: instill four drops (equivalent to 0.14 mL of Ciprodex, consisting of 0.42 mg of ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg of dexamethasone) into the affected ear twice daily for seven days. Warm the suspension by holding the bottle in hand for one to two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from instillation of a cold suspension. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and the drops should be instilled. The tragus should be pumped five times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. Maintain this position for 60 seconds and repeat if necessary for the opposite ear. Discard any unused portion after therapy is completed.

	- **For the treatment of acute otitis externa (age 6 months and older)**: The recommended dosage regimen is as follows: instill four drops (equivalent to 0.14 mL of Ciprodex, consisting of 0.42 mg of ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg of dexamethasone) into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.

### Combined intrastromal injection of amphotericin B and topical fluconazole in the treatment of resistant cases of keratomycosis: a retrospective study [^113SUrNq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Cases of keratomycosis remain challenging to ophthalmologists due to the difficulties in managing such cases. These range from the availability and susceptibility of antifungal agents to the penetration of corneal tissues. Fungal pathogens tend to deeply penetrate corneal tissues and may eventually reach the anterior chamber. Thus, intrastromal and intracameral injection of antifungal agents, especially polyenes such as amphotericin B, represents the best chance for managing such infections. These routes allow higher concentrations of the antifungal agents in corneal tissue and aqueous humor than topical use, thereby enhancing the drugs' antifungal effects.

The topical application of azoles, especially fluconazole and voriconazole, has been proven to be safe for ocular tissues and exhibits good penetration into corneal tissue. Therefore, these eye drops are considered suitable for ocular use from a toxicological perspective. Combination therapy with antifungal agents has demonstrated potent antifungal activity and yields the best results in treating keratomycosis, particularly in mild and moderate cases. Gatifloxacin is a potent antibiotic with additional antifungal effects. It has been preferred for topical application in keratomycosis, as combined bacterial and fungal infections have been reported in many cases. Consequently, many studies have preferred the use of antibiotics possessing some antifungal effects.
