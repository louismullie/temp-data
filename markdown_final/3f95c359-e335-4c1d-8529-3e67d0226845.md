## Question

What is the significance of FEV1 in diagnosing COPD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of FEV1 in diagnosing COPD and how to interpret it in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition of COPD and why spirometry is central. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criterion, including the fixed-ratio threshold and the requirement for post-bronchodilator testing. Next, I will examine how FEV1 (as a percentage predicted) is used to grade severity and how that relates — but does not dictate — symptom burden and exacerbation risk. After that, I should review the controversies around the fixed ratio versus the lower limit of normal and what the data show. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications, including screening versus case-finding, PRISm, and follow-up testing strategy.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition. COPD is defined by chronic respiratory symptoms and persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible; spirometry is mandatory to document that airflow limitation, making spirometry the cornerstone of diagnosis and not merely supportive testing [^114bjVtx].

> I need to check the diagnostic criterion precisely. The key diagnostic abnormality is a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70, which confirms non-fully reversible airflow obstruction and establishes COPD in the appropriate clinical context. I should confirm that GOLD explicitly requires post-bronchodilator values, not pre-bronchodilator, to avoid overcalling asthma or transient variability as COPD [^113WdzSb] [^114cNF8H] [^114bjVtx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single threshold being perfect. I initially thought the fixed ratio might systematically misclassify older adults; wait, let me verify the evidence. Large pooled cohort data show that FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 discriminates clinically important COPD outcomes as well as or better than the lower limit of normal, supporting the fixed-ratio approach despite known overdiagnosis in some elderly and underdiagnosis in some younger adults; GOLD also notes no inferiority of the fixed ratio to LLN for prognostication and continues to favor it [^1167udba] [^116Rwkyi].

> Next, I should review severity grading because this is where FEV1 enters again. Once airflow obstruction is confirmed by the ratio, severity is staged by post-bronchodilator FEV1 as a percentage of predicted: GOLD 1 (≥ 80%), GOLD 2 (50–79%), GOLD 3 (30–49%), and GOLD 4 (< 30%). Let me double-check those cut points and ensure I'm aligning with the current grading schema [^113eRQyK] [^114cNF8H].

> But wait, what if I assume FEV1 grade directly tracks symptoms or exacerbation risk? I should confirm that GOLD cautions against this. At the individual level, FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of dyspnea, exercise limitation, health status, or exacerbation risk; treatment decisions are guided by a combined assessment that includes symptoms and exacerbation history, not by FEV1 grade alone, which explains the evolution from the old ABCD tool to the current ABE approach [^116aRVSb] [^1164Dcbs] [^1136DXyW].

> I will now examine the role of FEV1 in prognosis and monitoring. Lower FEV1 and faster FEV1 decline are consistently associated with higher mortality and worse outcomes. Pharmacotherapy can modestly slow the rate of FEV1 decline, and tracking FEV1 over time remains a standard part of follow-up to gauge disease progression and risk, even though it does not dictate day-to-day symptom-directed therapy [^112YnNoS] [^113mYcBg] [^114JK64x].

> Let me consider the practical diagnostic algorithm to ensure I'm not missing steps. Suspect COPD in patients with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum, recurrent lower respiratory infections, or exposure risks; obtain spirometry; if pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is less than 0.7, confirm with post-bronchodilator testing; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC remains less than 0.7, COPD is confirmed; if the ratio normalizes post-bronchodilator, that suggests a bronchodilator response and warrants close follow-up rather than a firm COPD label; I should double-check that GOLD supports using pre-bronchodilator spirometry as an initial screen in symptomatic patients [^115Dzv9i] [^115TQgF8].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of reversibility testing. Assessing the degree of acute bronchodilator reversibility to distinguish COPD from asthma or to guide therapy is no longer recommended. Variability is high, it does not reliably predict long-term treatment response, and patients do not need to stop inhaled medications before routine spirometry during follow-up, which simplifies care and avoids misleading reversibility interpretations [^113d5NE3] [^117UbHaF].

> Next, I should review screening versus case-finding because this affects when FEV1 is measured. Population screening of asymptomatic adults is not recommended; however, active case-finding in symptomatic patients or those with risk factors improves diagnostic yield and can lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes, so spirometry should be prioritized in those contexts rather than used indiscriminately [^115CCHb3] [^114dccBd].

> I need to ensure I address PRISm and related entities. Individuals with preserved FEV1/FVC ratio but impaired spirometry (FEV1 < 80% predicted) are labeled PRISm; they have increased risks of symptoms, cardiopulmonary disease, and mortality, and about 20–30% transition to obstruction over time, so they merit follow-up even though they do not meet diagnostic criteria for COPD today [^113sCTsi] [^112Hwenb].

> Let me reconsider the fixed-ratio controversy one more time to avoid overconfidence. While LLN-based definitions may reduce false positives in older adults, they tend to underdiagnose clinically meaningful disease; adding FEV1 and RV/TLC to fixed-ratio or LLN approaches improves alignment with expert diagnosis, but robust, externally validated thresholds are still needed before routine adoption, reinforcing GOLD's current stance favoring the fixed ratio for diagnosis and prognostication [^114MvuHm] [^116Rwkyi].

> Finally, I should confirm practical quality considerations because misclassification undermines everything. High-quality spirometry requires proper equipment, trained operators, and adherence to acceptability and reproducibility criteria. Repeating measurements when the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is borderline (for example, 0.6–0.8) helps confirm persistence, and using the largest FVC and FEV1 from technically satisfactory maneuvers ensures accurate ratio calculation and grading [^117Dpbtm] [^117As1no].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: FEV1 is central to COPD in two complementary ways — first, the FEV1/FVC ratio confirms airflow obstruction post-bronchodilator to establish the diagnosis, and second, FEV1 as a percentage predicted stages severity and informs prognosis and longitudinal monitoring. However, treatment decisions hinge on symptoms and exacerbation history rather than FEV1 alone, and the fixed-ratio threshold remains the pragmatic, evidence-supported diagnostic criterion despite ongoing debates [^113WdzSb] [^113eRQyK] [^116aRVSb] [^1167udba].

FEV1 is central to COPD diagnosis because a **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70** [^113WdzSb] confirms persistent airflow limitation and establishes COPD in the right clinical context [^114bjVtx]. FEV1 is also used to **grade severity** (GOLD 1–4) [^113eRQyK] and informs prognosis and treatment decisions, but it does not capture symptoms or exacerbation risk [^116aRVSb]; therefore, management should also use symptom scores and exacerbation history [^114cNF8H]. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry alone is insufficient [^113d5NE3], and FEV1 must be interpreted with clinical context and, when needed, repeated to confirm obstruction [^117As1no].

---

## Definition and measurement of FEV1

FEV1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second [^116kMnVa]; it is measured by spirometry, the **gold standard** [^113QueU7] for diagnosing and monitoring COPD. Spirometry is non-invasive, reproducible, and widely available, making it the cornerstone of COPD assessment [^11167XJX].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for COPD using FEV1

COPD is diagnosed when **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70** [^113WdzSb] [^1167udba], indicating persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible [^117Dpbtm]. This criterion is recommended by GOLD and widely adopted in clinical practice [^114cNF8H].

---

## Role of FEV1 in grading COPD severity

FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value is used to **grade the severity** of airflow obstruction in COPD:

| **Gold grade** | **Severity** | **Fev1 (% predicted)** |
|-|-|-|
| Grade 1 | Mild | ≥ 80% |
| Grade 2 | Moderate | 50–79% |
| Grade 3 | Severe | 30–49% |
| Grade 4 | Very severe | < 30% |

---

This grading system helps **guide treatment decisions** and prognosis, although it does not fully capture symptom burden or exacerbation risk [^116aRVSb].

---

## Clinical significance of FEV1 in COPD management

FEV1 is a key **prognostic indicator** in COPD [^115JrQFj]. Lower FEV1 correlates with increased risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality [^115JrQFj]. It also guides pharmacologic therapy, with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids shown to improve FEV1 and reduce exacerbation risk [^111vrvyT].

---

## Limitations of FEV1 in COPD diagnosis and management

While FEV1 is essential, it has **limitations**:

- **Symptom correlation**: FEV1 does not fully reflect symptom severity or quality of life, necessitating additional tools like the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale [^111qBQ1r].
- **Exacerbation risk**: FEV1 alone does not predict exacerbation risk accurately, requiring consideration of exacerbation history [^1164Dcbs].
- **Heterogeneity**: COPD is heterogeneous, and FEV1 may not capture all aspects of disease, prompting use of additional tests like diffusing capacity (DLCO) and imaging in selected cases [^1155TiB7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 [^114bjVtx] as the **diagnostic standard** for COPD [^114dccBd]. They also recommend comprehensive assessment incorporating symptoms, exacerbation history, and comorbidities to guide individualized management [^1136DXyW].

---

## Conclusion

FEV1 is central to COPD diagnosis and management, providing objective evidence of airflow limitation and informing severity grading and treatment decisions. However, it **must be interpreted within the clinical context**, including symptoms and exacerbation history, to optimize patient outcomes [^116aRVSb].

COVID-19 — spirometry precautions and alternatives: During periods of high prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, spirometry should be restricted to patients requiring urgent or essential tests for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. When routine spirometry is not available, home measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) combined with validated patient questionnaires could be used to support or refute a possible diagnosis of COPD, although PEF does not correlate well with the results of spirometry, has low specificity, and cannot differentiate obstructive and restrictive lung function abnormalities. Airflow obstruction could also be confirmed by giving patients a personal electronic portable spirometers with instruction and observation in their homes using video conferencing technology, and the ATS and ERS have provided recommendations regarding testing and precautions that should be taken.

### Spirometry for the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114SZhXd]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Spirometric testing is one of the oldest clinical tests still in use today. It is a straightforward test that has the patient maximally exhale from total lung capacity. The key measurements are the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) and the maximum exhaled volume (vital capacity [VC]). Spirometric testing utility, however, depends heavily upon the quality of equipment, the patient cooperation, and the skill of the technician performing the test. Spirometry should thus be considered a medical test and not simply a vital sign that can be performed by minimally trained personnel. In obstructive lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the characteristic changes in spirometry are a reduction in the FEV(1) with respect to the vital capacity (FEV(1)/VC ratio). Using this measurement can diagnose the presence and severity of airway obstruction. This can be used to guide therapies and predict outcomes. Using spirometry to screen for obstructive lung disease, however, can be problematic, and the effect of screening on outcomes has yet to be demonstrated.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112HQBsk]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

### Strategies for screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cmA5u]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is easily detected in its preclinical phase, using office spirometry. Successful smoking cessation prevents further disease progression in most patients. Spirometry measures the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC), which is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting airflow limitation. Primary care practitioners see the majority of adult smokers, but few primary care practitioners currently have spirometers or regularly order spirometry for their smoker patients. Improvements in spirometry software have made it much easier to obtain good quality spirometry test sessions, thereby reducing the misclassification rate. Respiratory therapists and pulmonary function technologists can help primary care practitioners select good office spirometers for identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and teach staff how to use spirometers correctly.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to short-acting bronchodilators, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate regular and as-needed short-acting β-agonists or SAMAs to improve FEV1 and symptoms in patients with stable COPD. Initiate combinations of short-acting β-agonists or SAMAs for better improvements in FEV1 and symptoms.

### Population impact of different definitions of airway obstruction [^111kCswh]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on the criteria for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study evaluated the impact of different definitions of airway obstruction on the estimated prevalence of obstruction in a population-based sample. Using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, obstructive airway disease was defined using the following criteria: 1) self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema; 2) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70 and FEV1 < 80% predicted (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Stage IIA); 3) FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal; 4) FEV1/FVC < 88% pred in males and < 89% pred in females; 5) FEV1/FVC < 0.70 ("fixed ratio"). Spirometry in this dataset did not include reversibility testing, making it impossible to distinguish reversible from irreversible obstruction. Rates in adults varied from 77 per 1,000 (self-report) to 168 per 1,000 (fixed ratio). For persons aged > 50 yrs, the fixed ratio criteria produced the highest rate estimates. For all subgroups tested, the GOLD Stage II criteria produced lower estimates than other spirometry-based definitions. Different definitions of obstruction may produce prevalence estimates that vary by > 200%. International opinion leaders should agree upon a clear definition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that can serve as a population-based measurement criterion as well as a guide to clinicians.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society research statement on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outlines that the goal is to describe evidence related to diagnosis, assessment, and management; identify gaps in knowledge; and make recommendations for future research, and it is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on COPD diagnosis and management. Methods state that clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in COPD were invited to participate; a literature search of Medline was performed; the search was not a systematic review of the evidence; and existing evidence was appraised and summarized, and then salient knowledge gaps were identified. Recommendations for research that addresses important gaps in the evidence in all areas of COPD were formulated via discussion and consensus. The introduction summarizes disease burden, noting Global Burden of Disease estimates that COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and in the United States, caused more than 3 million deaths in 2010 alone, is the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost, that COPD-related mortality more than doubled among women over a 20-year observation period, and that exacerbations account for 50 to 75% of the cost associated with COPD.

### Discriminative accuracy of FEV1: FVC thresholds for COPD-related hospitalization and mortality [^1167udba]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

According to numerous current guidelines, the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires a ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity (FEV1:FVC) of less than 0.70, yet this fixed threshold is based on expert opinion and remains controversial.

Objective

To determine the discriminative accuracy of various FEV1:FVC fixed thresholds for predicting COPD-related hospitalization and mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Pooled Cohorts Study harmonized and pooled data from 4 US general population-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study; Cardiovascular Health Study; Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study; and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Participants aged 45 to 102 years were enrolled from 1987 to 2000 and received follow-up longitudinally through 2016.

Exposures

Presence of airflow obstruction, which was defined by a baseline FEV1:FVC less than a range of fixed thresholds (0.75 to 0.65) or less than the lower limit of normal as defined by Global Lung Initiative reference equations (LLN).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of COPD hospitalization and COPD-related mortality, defined by adjudication or administrative criteria. The optimal fixed FEV1:FVC threshold was defined by the best discrimination for these COPD-related events as indexed using the Harrell C statistic from unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Differences in C statistics were compared with respect to less than 0.70 and less than LLN thresholds using a nonparametric approach.

Results

Among 24 207 adults in the pooled cohort (mean [SD] age at enrollment, 63 [10.5] years; 12 990 [54%] women; 16 794 [69%] non-Hispanic white; 15 181 [63%] ever smokers), complete follow-up was available for 11 077 (77%) at 15 years. During a median follow-up of 15 years, 3925 participants experienced COPD-related events over 340 757 person-years of follow-up (incidence density rate, 11.5 per 1000 person-years), including 3563 COPD-related hospitalizations and 447 COPD-related deaths. With respect to discrimination of COPD-related events, the optimal fixed threshold (0.71; C statistic for optimal fixed threshold, 0.696) was not significantly different from the 0.70 threshold (difference, 0.001 [95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004]) but was more accurate than the LLN threshold (difference, 0.034 [95% CI, 0.028 to 0.041]). The 0.70 threshold provided optimal discrimination in the subgroup analysis of ever smokers and in adjusted models.

Conclusions and Relevance

Defining airflow obstruction as FEV1:FVC less than 0.70 provided discrimination of COPD-related hospitalization and mortality that was not significantly different or was more accurate than other fixed thresholds and the LLN. These results support the use of FEV1:FVC less than 0.70 to identify individuals at risk of clinically significant COPD.

### Burden and clinical features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^112PMVdy]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality and represents a substantial economic and social burden throughout the world. It is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide and further increases in its prevalence and mortality are expected in the coming decades. The substantial morbidity associated with COPD is often underestimated by health-care providers and patients; likewise, COPD is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. COPD develops earlier in life than is usually believed. Tobacco smoking is by far the major risk for COPD and the prevalence of the disease in different countries is related to rates of smoking and time of introduction of cigarette smoking. Contribution of occupational risk factors is quite small, but may vary depending on a country's level of economic development. Severe deficiency for alpha-1-antitrypsin is rare and the impact of other genetic factors on the prevalence of COPD has not been established. COPD should be considered in any patient presenting with cough, sputum production, or dyspnoea, especially if an exposure to risk factors for the disease has been present. Clinical diagnosis needs to be confirmed by standardised spirometric tests in the presence of not-fully-reversible airflow limitation. COPD is generally a progressive disease. Continued exposure to noxious agents promotes a more rapid decline in lung function and increases the risk for repeated exacerbations. Smoking cessation is the only intervention shown to slow the decline. If exposure is stopped, the disease may still progress due to the decline in lung function that normally occurs with aging, and some persistence of the inflammatory response.

### A STAR is born: a new approach to assessing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity [^114myXVF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The essential role of the doctor in all societies is the ability to name the illness that affects the patient; predict its natural history; and, in more recent times, intervene to reverse or ameliorate its impact. For those with what we now describe as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the last 30 years has seen significant progress in all these aspects of medical practice. After many years of debate about what to call this illness, there is now a global consensus that COPD is the best term to use, and this is reflected in its increased recognition by patients and healthcare funders. Although the precise terms used to define COPD have evolved, there is general agreement that accurate diagnosis involves the demonstration that the FEV 1 /FVC ratio is less than 0.7 or, as some advocate, below the lower limit of normal for a person of similar age, sex, and height. To exclude the individuals with significant degrees of reversible airflow obstruction, post-bronchodilator spirometry is recommended, although the need for this has been challenged.

Although COPD is defined by an abnormal ratio, the experts (myself included) who developed the current severity classifications used the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 expressed as a percent predicted (pp) to create broad groups characterized by worsening lung function. Although the ways in which individuals might find themselves in a given group are complex, the simple system that arbitrarily splits patients into mild (above 80 pp), moderate (79–50 pp), severe (49–30 pp), and very severe (below 30 pp) disease seemed to accord with clinical experience and has been shown to identify patients whose natural history of disease was different. Although no longer used as a direct guide to therapy and now renamed as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1–4, the FEV 1 grading performs better than systems based on worsening z -score.

Lung resection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — Risk factors should be identified by careful history taking including physical examination, chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests. There is consensus that all COPD candidates for lung resection should undergo a complete battery of tests, including spirometry with bronchodilator response, static lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and arterial blood gases at rest, and those at high risk for surgical complications due to poor lung function should undergo further assessment such as tests of regional distribution of perfusion and exercise capacity. The risk of postoperative complications from lung resection appears to be increased with decreased predicted postoperative pulmonary function (FEV1 or DLco < 30–40% predicted) or reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2 < 10 ml/kg/min or 35% predicted). The final decision to pursue surgery should be made after discussion with the surgeon, pulmonary specialist, primary clinician, and the patient, and surgery should be postponed if an exacerbation is present.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^114MvuHm]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a fixed post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) below 0.7. Age-dependent cut-off values below the lower fifth percentile (LLN) of this ratio derived from the general population have been proposed as an alternative. We wanted to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic capability of the GOLD and LLN definition when compared to an expert-based diagnosis.

Methods

In a prospective cohort study, 405 patients aged ≥ 65 years with a general practitioner's diagnosis of COPD were recruited and followed up for 4.5 (median; quartiles 3.9; 5.1) years. Prevalence rates of COPD according to GOLD and three LLN definitions and diagnostic performance measurements were calculated. The reference standard was the diagnosis of COPD of an expert panel that used all available diagnostic information, including spirometry and bodyplethysmography.

Results

Compared to the expert panel diagnosis, 'GOLD-COPD' misclassified 69 (28%) patients, and the three LLNs misclassified 114 (46%), 96 (39%), and 98 (40%) patients, respectively. The GOLD classification led to more false positives, the LLNs to more false negative diagnoses. The main predictors beyond the FEV1/FVC ratio for an expert diagnosis of COPD were the FEV1% predicted, and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC). Adding FEV1 and RV/TLC to GOLD or LLN improved the diagnostic accuracy, resulting in a significant reduction of up to 50% of the number of misdiagnoses. The expert diagnosis of COPD better predicts exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality than GOLD or LLN.

Conclusions

GOLD criteria over-diagnose COPD, while LLN definitions under-diagnose COPD in elderly patients as compared to an expert panel diagnosis. Incorporating FEV1 and RV/TLC into the GOLD-COPD or LLN-based definition brings both definitions closer to expert panel diagnosis of COPD, and to daily clinical practice.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^117UbHaF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fourth, while post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate COPD from asthma (except when airflow limitation disappears following bronchodilators, which is incompatible with COPD), or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Accordingly, it is not necessary nor advised to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Finally, the role of screening spirometry in the general population for the diagnosis of COPD is also controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposure to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated. By contrast, in those with symptoms and/or risk factors (e.g. > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, prematurity, or other significant early-life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high, and spirometry should be considered as a method for case finding.

Pathophysiology — airflow obstruction and gas trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually measured by spirometry and reflects both small airways disease and parenchymal destruction, leading to reduced lung elastic recoil, expiratory airway collapse, and diminished forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio that contribute to gas trapping and lung hyperinflation. Airflow obstruction is usually measured by spirometry as this is the most widely available and reproducible test of lung function. In COPD, airflow obstruction is caused by a mixture of small airways disease and emphysematous parenchymal destruction, with chronic inflammation narrowing small airways, producing luminal exudates, destroying alveolar attachments, and decreasing elastic recoil; collectively these changes limit emptying of the lungs during forced expiration, decrease FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, and contribute to gas trapping and lung hyperinflation.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Patients presenting with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are initially assessed to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been made and that relevant differential diagnoses are excluded. Although guidelines provide indicators for use, very little systematic research has been done in initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. Next, the assessment should aim at stratifying patients for risk of poor outcome. For this, predictors of poor prognosis as well as knowledge of favorable treatments can be used. However, no formal and validated staging system exists today. Given the frequency and impact of COPD exacerbations, there seems to be a need for systematic research in this area.

Staging the severity of airflow obstruction — method preference and prognosis: GOLD continues to recommend using the FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value to stage the severity of airflow obstruction. The ERS and ATS recommend using z-scores rather than percent predicted values to stage severity. For the time being GOLD recommends continuing to use this method to assess severity of airflow limitation. In patients with airflow obstruction a low FEV1 or a rapid decline in FEV1 is associated with increased mortality.

Diagnosis: Forced Spirometry

A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who complains of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (see above), but forced vital capacity maneuver during spirometry showing the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 is needed to establish the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV 1 also serves to determine the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1, 2, 3, 4 or mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Yet, several important aspects related to forced spirometry need to be considered here.

First, airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD. For instance, it may also be found in patients with asthma and other diseases, so the clinical context and risk factors (see above) must also be considered when establishing a diagnosis of COPD.

### EARLY versus MILD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^116dscjw]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is very a common, with great morbidity and mortality, disease. Since the beginning of the disease cannot be detected with precision and by using only FEV1 to monitor the evolution of the disease, the Natural History of COPD is rather obscure and sometimes controversial. Therefore, the terms EARLY COPD and MILD COPD have been used indistinguishably in the medical literature. In this review we discuss the two terms trying to clarify some of the definition issues, starting with a synopsis of the Naturel History of the disease. We recommend to use the term EARLY COPD for the pre-clinical stage of the disease (stage 0) and the term MILD COPD when the diagnosis is confirmed by spirometry and FEV1 is above 80% predicted. However, COPD is a complex disease and spirometric evaluation alone (MILD COPD, stage I), cannot fully describe the clinical status of the patient. We conclude that biomarkers to detect the starting point and been able to follow the natural history of the disease more accurately, beyond FEV, are urgently needed.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — PRISm (preserved ratio impaired spirometry) definition, prevalence, risks, and progression: "The term PRISm (preserved ratio impaired spirometry) describes individuals with preserved ratio (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 after bronchodilation) but impaired spirometry (FEV1 < 80% of reference, after bronchodilation)". Prevalence estimates include "ranges from 7.1% to 11%" in population-based studies and "from 10.4% to 11.3% in a selected population of current and former smokers such as the COPDGene cohort". PRISm is "particularly high in current and former smokers", is "associated with both high and low body mass index (BMI) values, female gender, obesity and multimorbidity", and is "associated with increased risk of: respiratory symptoms; cardiopulmonary disease; all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; hospitalization; and an increased risk of developing airways obstruction". PRISm "is not always a stable phenotype", and "around 20% to 30% of PRISm subjects transitioned to obstructed spirometry over time", with predictors including "lower baseline FEV1%, and FEV1/FVC, higher age, current smoking, female gender, and a longer FET in the second assessment".

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnostic considerations [^111djrCu]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by the gradual progression of irreversible airflow obstruction and increased inflammation in the airways and lung parenchyma that is generally distinguishable from the inflammation caused by asthma. Most chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with smoking, but occupational exposure to irritants and air pollution also are important risk factors. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease typically present with coughing, sputum production, and dyspnea on exertion. However, none of these findings alone is diagnostic. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease diagnostic criterion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio of less than 70 percent of the predicted value. Severity is further stratified based on forced expiratory volume in one second and symptoms. Chest radiography may rule out alternative diagnoses and comorbid conditions. Selected patients should be tested for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Arterial blood gas testing is recommended for patients presenting with signs of severe disease, right-sided heart failure, or significant hypoxemia. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also is a systemic disorder with weight loss and dysfunction of respiratory and skeletal muscles.

### Is there a role for screening spirometry? [^115GzvNJ]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In obstructive lung disease, the characteristic change in spirometry is a reduction in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) with respect to the vital capacity. Moreover, the severity of the obstruction can be graded by referencing spirometric measurements to age, sex, and height predicted normal values. Spirometry, however, should be considered a medical test, and not simply a vital sign that anyone can perform. Indeed, both technical issues and tester skills can profoundly affect the results and interpretations. Properly done spirometry can guide therapies and predict outcomes, but using spirometry to screen for obstructive lung disease in asymptomatic populations can be problematic, and the effects of screening spirometry on outcomes have yet to be determined. The value of spirometry is increased when it is of good quality, is interpreted properly, and is used in high-risk populations as a case-finding rather than a screening tool.

### Primary care of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-part 1: frontline prevention and early diagnosis [^11556M3h]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most important chronic respiratory illness affecting adults in the United States, yet it remains grossly underdiagnosed. This article translates key guideline recommendations for prevention and early diagnosis of COPD into the practical context of primary care. A literature review identified clinical trials with relevant information on COPD epidemiology, diagnosis, the role of primary care clinicians, the implementation of spirometry, and the impact of smoking cessation. After formal presentations to a panel of pulmonary specialists and primary care clinicians, key messages were identified and integrated to create this first report in a 4-part mini-symposium. The main points of the roundtable consensus were as follows: (1) ≥ 50% of smokers will develop some degree of COPD; (2) patients with earlier stages of COPD are often undiagnosed; (3) too many clinicians are not aware that COPD is partially reversible; (4) treatment of COPD can improve patient symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life, and health status, and prevent exacerbations; (5) diagnosis can be easily accomplished with a careful history and in-office spirometry in symptomatic patients and those at risk (e.g., present and past smokers); and (6) all smokers should be identified and targeted for smoking cessation programs. We conclude that primary care clinicians see the vast majority of patients with early or mild COPD. These practitioners must become aware that COPD is an important problem in their patient population and that they need to integrate simple questions and in-office tools into their practice to increase their diagnosis of COPD.

### Lung function decline in relation to diagnostic criteria for airflow obstruction in respiratory symptomatic subjects [^115nNAtP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that is characterized by irreversible and progressive airflow obstruction, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. COPD is predominantly diagnosed in adults aged well over 40 years. In developed countries cigarette smoking is the main risk factor, and accelerated lung function decline is the predominant clinical and prognostic hallmark of the disease. Spirometry is recommended to assess airflow obstruction, i.e. to establish the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Next, severity of obstruction is quantified by calculation of FEV1 as percentage of predicted value.

For subjects suspected of having the disease current clinical COPD guidelines recommend a fixed FEV1/FVC cutpoint < 0.70 (after administration of a bronchodilator) to decide whether or not airflow obstruction is present. However, because lung function physiologically declines with age, it has recently been advocated that a correct definition of airflow obstruction should not be based on a fixed cutpoint for all ages, but should take the physiological decline into account. One suggested approach for this is to use lower limit of normal (LLN) cutpoints based on the distribution of FEV1/FVC values in an appropriate reference population, which takes gender and age differences between individuals into account. Several recent studies have shown high rates of false-positive interpretations (especially among elderly subjects) when the 0.70 fixed cutpoint is off-set against an age-specific LLN cutpoint. Because the majority of COPD patients are diagnosed and managed in primary care and primary care doctors need to differentiate between various underlying causes for the respiratory symptoms a patient presents with (i.e. asthma, COPD, congestive heart failure, and a wide range of other causes), it is especially important for them to know which cutpoint is preferred when assessing the presence (or absence) of airflow obstruction. This is even more important because in elderly patients co-morbid conditions are often present, and misattribution of a patient's symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) to COPD could lead to inappropriate or delayed treatment.

Combined initial COPD assessment — In 2011, GOLD proposed moving from a simple spirometric grading system to a combined assessment based on the level of symptoms (mMRC or CAT™), the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4), and the frequency of previous exacerbations to guide initial pharmacological treatment, incorporating patient-reported outcomes and highlighting exacerbation prevention. The initial version relied on both the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4) and the frequency of previous exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk, but the severity of airflow obstruction was subsequently removed considering its lower precision at the individual level to predict outcomes and drive treatment decisions, while complexifying the use of the classification by clinicians. In the 2023 GOLD report, GOLD proposed a further evolution of the ABCD combined assessment tool in which the A and B groups remained unchanged and the C and D groups were merged into a single group termed "E", recognizing the clinical relevance of exacerbations; it was acknowledged that this proposal would have to be validated by appropriate clinical research.

Assessment after diagnosis — disease severity predictors and multidimensional assessment indicate that classification of COPD severity by spirometry alone predicts patient-centered outcomes but is primarily intended for populations and is not a substitute for clinical judgment; body mass index (BMI) values less than 21 kg/m2 and increased modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea levels are associated with increased mortality, and exacerbation frequency, health status, and level of physical activity also predict mortality; the GOLD Global Strategy proposed a multidimensional assessment including high/low symptoms using the mMRC dyspnea score, the COPD Assessment Test, or the clinical COPD questionnaire, the severity of airflow limitation, and the number of yearly exacerbations, with high symptoms described as mMRC dyspnea score ≥ 2, COPD Assessment Test score ≥ 10, or clinical COPD questionnaire score ≥ 1.

Diagnosis of COPD according to the GOLD and LLN criteria

A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 established the diagnosis 'GOLD-COPD'. The 'GOLD-COPD' was graded using post-bronchodilator % of predicted FEV1 values: GOLD stage 1 (mild): ≥ 80%; stage 2 (moderate): 50–79%; stage 3 (severe): 30–49; stage 4 (very severe) < 30%.

A FEV1/FVC ratio below the lower fifth percentile of healthy reference groups (similar age) established the diagnosis 'LLN-COPD'. From several LLN equations provided by[-] we selected three LLN reference equations on the basis of sample size, popularity and comparability with the age of our study population. These equations were derived from the following populations:

1. Enright et al.: USA; healthy Caucasians with no respiratory symptoms, N = 1,227, 26% male, age range 65–85 years, non-smokers or all-time smoking duration < 5 years.

2. Quanjer et al. (ECCS/ERS): Europe; healthy never-smokers with no respiratory symptoms, N = 1,204, 27% male, age range 20–70 years.

3. Falaschetti et al. (Health Survey for England): Great Britain; healthy never-smokers with no respiratory disease, N = 6,053, 41% male, age range 16–85 years.

The aforementioned reference equations of the LLN-COPD definitions are based on pre-bronchodilator values, and the GOLD-COPD definition on post-bronchodilatory FEV1/FVC values. We analysed both pre- and post-bronchodilator cut-off values for both definitions. Because the results were similar, we only present the post-bronchodilator results.

Prognostic outcomes

Exacerbations of COPD (need for short course of oral steroids), hospitalization for COPD, and all-cause mortality were assessed blinded to the diagnostic classification.

Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic algorithm for COPD: Measure pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, classify as not COPD, with consideration to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC if a volume responder is suspected (e.g., low FEV1 or high symptoms). If pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, interpret as flow response needing follow-up with repeat assessment, and if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, COPD is confirmed. If the pre-bronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post-bronchodilator measurements, and individuals whose pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC shows obstruction but whose post-bronchodilator ratio does not show obstruction have an increased risk of future development of COPD and should be followed closely.

### The challenges of defining early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population [^1173MH5g]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a huge global health burden that is projected to become the third-leading cause of mortality by 2030. Established COPD is highly heterogeneous with a lack of disease-modifying treatments. A clearer understanding of the condition is often impeded by the high rate of comorbidities that patients typically exhibit at the point of diagnosis. It is now apparent that there are a range of subpopulations at risk for accelerated disease progression. The mechanisms underpinning these varying trajectories that lead to the development of COPD are highly complex but are significantly influenced by early life exposures. Furthermore, it is now understood that at the point of diagnosis, individuals with COPD have been symptomatic for at least 5 years, underlining the critical need for detection of the disease and efficacious interventions at the early stage.

To date, the majority of COPD studies attempting to examine the concept of early COPD have included populations with mean ages older than 60 years. As Martinez and colleagues highlight in a recent review, these studies therefore inform on late "mild disease" as opposed to "early disease". Although the initial events responsible for ultimate development of pathology currently cannot be described, this expert group proposed an operational definition for early COPD based on surrogate end points that encompasses lung pathology unequivocally associated with subsequent accelerated lung function decline leading to objectively confirmed incompletely reversible airflow obstruction and other COPD-related manifestations (Table 1).

Table 1.
The Operational Criteria for Early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Characterizing the mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis is a pivotal step toward understanding individuals at risk of COPD and will hopefully lead to novel targets for treatment. However, to validate this hypothesis requires serial sampling in well-powered, long-lasting prospective cohorts.

In this issue of the Journal, Çolak and colleagues (pp.) investigate the relationship between early COPD and subsequent development of clinical COPD. This well-designed Danish study leveraged the large contemporary Copenhagen General Population Cohort to investigate lung function changes in 20- to 50-year-olds over a 10-year period. The authors identified those with early COPD by applying age and spirometric criteria (FEV 1 /FVC ratio less than lower limit of normal), in line with the operational definition proposed by Martinez and colleagues in 2017, to investigate the risk of subsequent clinical disease.

### Pulmonary function testing in COPD: looking beyond the curtain of FEV1 [^114Vwmci]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remains challenging due to the high heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and the complex pathophysiological basis of the disease. Airflow limitation, diagnosed by spirometry, remains the cornerstone of the diagnosis. However, the calculation of the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) alone, has limitations in uncovering the underlying complexity of the disease. Incorporating additional pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the everyday clinical evaluation of COPD patients, like resting volume, capacity and airway resistance measurements, diffusion capacity measurements, forced oscillation technique, field and cardiopulmonary exercise testing and muscle strength evaluation, may prove essential in tailoring medical management to meet the needs of such a heterogeneous patient population. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the available PFTs, which can be incorporated into the primary care physician's practice to enhance the efficiency of COPD management.

### Beta2 agonist reversibility testing in COPD diagnosis [^1127WCRR]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

The place of testingthe reversibility of airway obstruction with an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has caused some confusion in primary care. When reviewing the management of patients with stable COPD, in 2001, we stated that "to help rule out asthma, reversibility testing should be undertaken by measuring FEV1 [forced expiratory volume in 1 second] before and after the patient inhales a short-acting beta2 agonist". In keeping with this idea, the current general medical services (GMS) contract for GPs in the U.K. requires confirmation of the diagnosis of COPD with both spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction and reversibility testing of such obstruction. Other national and international guidelines have also recommended this approach. However, the National Institutefor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on COPD statesthat, in most patients, routine spirometric reversibility testing is not necessary in the diagnostic process, and that it should only be used when there is diagnostic uncertainty or if the patient is thought to have both COPD and asthma. Here we reconsider the role of reversibility testing with a short-acting beta2 agonist in the diagnosis of COPD.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) acknowledged the importance of FEV1 as distinct parameter to diagnose COPD, and defined airflow obstruction if both the FEV1/FVC ratio is < 0.7 and the FEV1 < 80% of predicted, and thus 'starting' the diagnosis of COPD from GOLD II onwards. Application of the NICE definition (post-bronchodilator values) in our cohort as compared to the expert panel diagnosis of COPD led to very high specificity (99%; only two false positives) but low sensitivity (66%, 82 false negatives). Incorporating a second PFT parameter as FEV1 into a FEV1/FVC-based definition might effectively reduce false positive test results, however for correction of false negative results at least a three parameters approach is needed.

Certain limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of our findings. PFT was only performed once at baseline, and secular trends could have been missed. Second, information on graphical PFT results as the flow volume curve or the flow pressure curve also enhance the diagnostic ability of the expert panel, but we could not quantify how much these graphs added to the final decision of the panel.

Another limitation in our study is incorporation bias when assessing the added value of other PFT variables to improve the diagnosis of GOLD or LLN. PFT parameters play an important role in the diagnosis of the expert panel. Thus, overoptimism of the diagnostic performance of PFT variables such as FEV1 and RV/TLC should be considered. Robust external validation and accurate cut-off calculations are still needed before the proposed algorithm of including FEV1 and RV/TLC in the GOLD or LLN definition may be adopted in routine practice. Our intention, however, was not to create a new definition of COPD, but to raise the awareness of some of the shortcomings of the single fixed cut-off value of FEV/FVC 0.7 and the age-adjusted LLN definitions.

In conclusion, both the conventional GOLD criteria and some of the most frequently used LLN-based diagnoses of COPD share major shortcomings as compared to the expert panel diagnosis of COPD. While GOLD definition tends to overdiagnose COPD, LLN-based definitions tend to underdiagnose COPD in symptomatic patients. Adding the information on FEV1 and RV/TLC to the GOLD definition reduced the number of misdiagnoses substantially for either definition. Further studies are needed to explore the usefulness of 'an upgraded' COPD or LLN diagnosis with determination of the optimal cut-off values for RV/TLC and DLCO.

Physiological tests — lung volumes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show that COPD patients exhibit gas trapping (a rise in residual volume) from the early stages of the disease, and as airflow obstruction worsens, static hyperinflation (an increase in total lung capacity) occurs, particularly during exercise (dynamic hyperinflation). These changes can be documented by body plethysmography, or less accurately by helium dilution lung volume measurement. These measurements help characterize the severity of COPD but are not essential to patient management.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Issues in pulmonary function testing for the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Bo2iE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review article is to provide an up-to-date summary on the current evidence for or against the use of lung function tests as screening and diagnostic tools for airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to consider the relevant issues in context.

Recent Findings

COPD is characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation with only partial reversibility on lung function testing. However, screening on a population basis or of an enriched 'at-risk' subset like chronic smokers is not supported by findings from previous epidemiological studies, screening trials or in currently published clinical management guidelines by professional societies and review bodies. The definition of airflow obstruction and the classification of disease severity of COPD also differ slightly between guidelines and statements from different professional societies.

Summary

Given the experience from previous screening trials and controversial classification of airflow obstruction by severity, it is impossible to have accurate screening results for COPD based on lung function tests alone. Clinical respiratory symptoms should be taken into consideration in terms of the diagnosis and management of COPD, as well as in any screening trial or programme that is to be attempted or implemented.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk — lung function trajectories and early-life determinants: Lung function trajectories vary across life, with trajectories above normal linked to healthier aging and those below normal linked to higher disease burden, and spirometry is framed as a global health marker. Reduced maximal attained lung function by spirometry identifies individuals at increased COPD risk, while early-life factors including birthweight and other "childhood disadvantage factors" are key determinants of adult lung function. In three independent longitudinal cohorts, approximately 50% of COPD development was attributed to accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the other 50% to abnormal lung growth and development with normal decline over time.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### From GOLD 0 to pre-COPD [^115JrQFj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) currently requires the demonstration of poorly reversible airflow limitation, defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7. Although some have argued that the lower limit of normal rather than a fixed value to define obstruction may be more accurate and theoretically more appropriate, recent pooled data from multiple NIH cohorts demonstrate that the fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.70 provides discrimination of COPD-related hospitalization and mortality that is equal to or better than other thresholds and the lower limit of normal.

At present, FEV 1 /FVC remains the most robust and widely available marker of airflow limitation, although it may be less sensitive than some other measures (e.g. forced oscillometry). Likewise, FEV 1 is one of the most powerful predictors of clinically relevant outcomes, including symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality. Spirometry is inexpensive and widely available, even in many developing countries. Yet, at the same time, at an individual level, FEV 1 may not fully indicate the extent of disease severity and progression, which may instead be manifest by symptoms, exacerbations, and increased risk of death. Furthermore, significant lung damage may have already occurred before abnormalities in FEV 1 are evident. Identifying individuals who will eventually develop airflow obstruction consistent with a diagnosis of COPD may enable therapeutic interventions with the potential to modify the course of disease.

### The effect of a post-bronchodilator FEV / FVC [^115RFvbR]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis

Our exploratory subgroup analysis suggested that physician specialty and the history of a COPD diagnosis may both impact the role of spirometry in COPD diagnosis (Table 3). While the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 did not have a significant effect on COPD diagnosis by pulmonologists (9.8%, 95% CI −4.9 to 24.4%) or other internal medicine physicians (4.5%, 95% CI −3.8 to 12.7%), it did increase the probability of a COPD diagnosis in encounters with emergency medicine physicians (29.3%, 95% CI 7.3–51.3%). Notably, in patients with a prior diagnosis of COPD, the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 had no effect on the diagnosis of COPD (0.9%, 95% CI −6.1 to 7.9%), with a probability of diagnosis of 84.8% above the cutoff and a probability of 85.8% below the cutoff.

Validity assessment

The validity of the RDD was supported by the absence of evidence of manipulation of the continuous variable (P = 0.186, e-Figure 2) and by the negative results of all placebo tests (e-Figure 3). Assessing the effect of different post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC cutoff values on COPD diagnosis we found that cutoffs of 0.58 and 0.67 were associated with a significant increase in the probability of diagnosis, while cutoffs of 0.60, 0.66, and 0.67 were associated with a significant decrease in the probability of diagnosis (e-Figure 4). These results likely reflect Type I errors as these cutoffs are not expected to have an effect on COPD diagnosis and the directionality of these effects were roughly even.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^116yybYv]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:

- **Definition**: COPD is a chronic lung disease characterized by non-reversible airflow obstruction and persistent symptoms of dyspnea and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: COPD is caused by airway inflammation and remodeling due to environmental exposures, primarily tobacco smoke. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway, alveoli, and pulmonary microvasculature causes destruction of lung parenchyma, and loss of elastic recoil in the lung tissue.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of the COPD is estimated at approximately 12,000 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: These pathologic changes lead to manifestations of irreversible airflow obstruction, as well as a progressive decline in lung function, which can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality rate of patients with COPD is estimated at 2.7 (95% CI, 2.5–3.0) in men and 4.8 (95% CI, 4.2–5.4) in women, respectively.

### Epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Ydz2v]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of world-wide mortality and disability. On average approximately 5–15% of adults in industrialized countries have COPD defined by spirometry. In 1990, COPD was considered to be at the twelfth position world-wide as a cause of combined mortality and disability but is expected to become the fifth cause by the year 2020. COPD has a chronic long-lasting course characterized by irreversible decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), increasing presence of dyspnoea and other respiratory symptoms, and progressive deterioration of health status. After diagnosis the 10-yr survival rate is approximately 50% with more than one-third of patients dying due to respiratory insufficiency. Several environmental exposures such as air pollution increase the risk of death in COPD patients. The aetiology of COPD is overwhelmingly dominated by smoking although many other factors could play a role. Particular genetic variants are likely to increase the susceptibility to environmental factors although little is known about which are the relevant genes. There is clear evidence about the role of the alpha-1-antitrypsin but the fraction of COPD attributable to the relevant variants is only 1%. Phenotypic traits that are considered to play a role in the development of COPD include sex, with females being at a higher risk, bronchial responsiveness and atopy. There is strong causal evidence regarding the relationship between smoking and COPD with decline in FEVI levelling off after smoking cessation. Passive smoking has been found to be associated with a small though statistically significant decline in FEV1. Other risk factors that are likely to be relevant in the development of COPD are occupation, low socioeconomic status, diet and possibly some environmental exposures in early life. Although there is accumulating evidence that oxygen therapy, pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation may improve the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preventing smoking continues to be the most relevant measure, not only to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also to arrest its development.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^115f3G1E]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In our study we show that false positive diagnosis of COPD occurred more often with the GOLD definition, while false negatives were more common with the LLN definitions as compared to an expert panel diagnosis as the reference test. Adding FEV1 and RV/TLC improved the GOLD and LLN approach, reducing misdiagnosed COPD by up to 50% depending on the cut-points applied. The expert panel diagnosis predicted best the occurrence of exacerbations of COPD, pulmonary hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality, followed by the GOLD and LLN definitions.

The choice of a fixed cut-off point for the GOLD-COPD definition was made for reasons of generalization and simplification. Although even lower FEV1/FVC ratios than 0.7 can be expected in the elderly without a pathological correlate, a spirometric test result of > 0.7 does not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of COPD in these patients. Especially elderly patients tend to incompletely empty their lungs during the performance of the FVC manoeuvre, resulting in a lower FVC value and thus an increased FEV1/FVC ratio, rendering false-negative COPD diagnoses more likely.

Multiple studies already showed that fewer patients are diagnosed as COPD positive when LLN definitions are applied instead of GOLD, especially in the elderly (e.g. 36 vs. 15% in a healthy Dutch cohort of patients aged ≥ 50 years). The present study confirms the aforementioned differences in prevalence rates of COPD according to GOLD or LLN. Importantly, however, all previous studies involved in the discussion whether LLN or GOLD should be applied, compared both methods without application of a reference test. Without a reference, however, it is impossible to answer which method performs better. This lack of evidence and the resulting diagnostic uncertainties have not been adequately appreciated. Application of the LLN will increase the chance of classifying COPD patients as having no COPD and thus the risk of undertreatment of especially elderly patients (Figure 2).

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^114naw24]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States.

Objective

To systematically review literature on the accuracy of screening questionnaires and office-based screening pulmonary function testing and the efficacy and harms of treatment of screen-detected COPD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through January 2015.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and studies. The search yielded 13,141 unique citations; 465 full-text articles were reviewed, and 33 studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers rated the quality of each study using USPSTF criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]; treatment efficacy (COPD exacerbations, all-cause mortality, quality of life, and dyspnea); and treatment harms.

Results

All screening questionnaires were based on symptoms as well as risk factors such as age and smoking history. The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire was the most extensively studied (5 studies, n = 3048), with moderate overall performance for COPD detection: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.65 to 0.72; sensitivity, 80% to 93%; and specificity, 24% to 49%, at a threshold of greater than 16.5. Positive predictive value and NPV ranged from 17% to 45% and 76% to 98%, respectively. For pulmonary function-based screening tools, FEV1/FEV6 was the best studied (3 studies, n = 1587), with AUC ranging from 0.84 to 0.85. Sensitivity ranged from 51% to 80%. Specificity (range, 90%-95%) and PPV (range, 63%-75%) appeared better than questionnaires. There was not strong evidence to support that screening and supplying smokers with spirometry results improves smoking cessation rates. Treatment trials were unavailable for screen-detected patients. Trials that reported outcomes in patients with mild to moderate COPD included 2 trials of long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) (n = 3174), 1 RCT of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (n = 1097), 5 RCTs of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist tiotropium (n = 4592), and 6 RCTs of ICS (n = 3983). They suggested no benefit in all-cause mortality, but a decrease in annual rates of exacerbations with pharmacologic treatments. Few trials reported harms for any individual drug class. Adverse effects were generally mild (eg, dry mouth and cough).

Conclusions and Relevance

There was no direct evidence available to determine the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults for COPD using questionnaires or office-based screening pulmonary function testing or to determine the benefits of treatment in screen-detected populations. Indirect evidence suggests that the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire has moderate overall performance for COPD detection. Among patients with mild to moderate COPD, the benefit of pharmacotherapy for reducing exacerbations was modest.

### Screening for and early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113QueU7]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a substantially underdiagnosed disorder, with the diagnosis typically missed or delayed until the condition is advanced. Spirometry is the most frequently used pulmonary function test and enables health professionals to make an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and assess the degree to which it is reversible. As a diagnostic test for COPD, spirometry is a reliable, simple, non-invasive, safe, and non-expensive procedure. Early diagnosis of COPD should provide support for smoking cessation initiatives and lead to reduction of the societal burden of the disease, but definitive confirmation of both proves elusive. Despite substantial effort and investment, implementation of quality spirometry is deficient because of several hurdles and limitations, described in this Review. All in all, spirometry is recognised as the essential test for diagnosis and monitoring of COPD.

We recommend: Studies that relate potential biomarkers of disease activity to patient-centered outcomes to validate the biomarkers as clinically useful measures of disease activity. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the impact of disease activity on treatment response and, conversely, the effects of treatment on disease activity.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116aRVSb]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^111oBrck]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the leading causes of disability and death in developed countries. The prevalence of COPD is still on the rise, and costs for the health system are substantial. Airflow limitation that is not fully reversible after bronchodilator application is a key feature of COPD, and spirometry is the routine diagnostic procedure of choice recommended to diagnose COPD. However, the degree of obstruction that establishes the diagnosis of COPD is still under debate. The Global Initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defined COPD as a fixed post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC ratio) of less than 0.70. This definition is widely accepted, mainly because of its practicability.

Since the FEV1 value decreases more quickly with age than the (F)VC, the GOLD definition tends to overdiagnose COPD in the elderly. Therefore, some authors suggested using the lower limit of normal (LLN) procedure to diagnose COPD. The LLN is based on age-stratified pre-bronchodilator cut-off values of the FEV1/FVC ratio, and a value below the lower fifth percentile of an aged-matched healthy reference group is considered abnormal and consistent with a diagnosis of COPD. Multiple studies showed that application of any population-derived LLN will result in lower prevalence estimates of COPD compared to the GOLD definition in the elderly. The question remains however which method should be preferred. Another question is, whether there are other pulmonary function test variables that could improve the diagnostic accuracy of GOLD or LLN. The final question is, which definition predicts best prognosis and thus is useful for treatment decisions in COPD. To answer all three questions, the two criteria should be compared with an alternative, and acceptable reference standard, applied in the relevant domain, that is, a population suspected of COPD. An expert panel diagnosis of COPD, based on all available diagnostic information from the clinical assessment, smoking habits, and a complete pulmonary function test (PFT) could be regarded as such a reference standard.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to validate GOLD and LLN criteria against an expert panel diagnosis in patients suspected of COPD and to assess their prognostic ability.

Since, in daily practice, establishing the diagnosis of COPD is usually not based on a single PFT parameter, we furthermore assessed whether the addition of other PFT parameters to the GOLD or LLN criteria increases diagnostic accuracy compared to either definition alone.

### The value of forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline in the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression [^113XGm8y]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) declines normally with aging by approximately 30 mL/yr, but in susceptible smokers, the decline is greater (about 60 mL/yr), resulting in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking cessation usually restores the normal or near-normal rate of FEV1 decline, whereas intermittent quitting provides less benefit. Thus, smoking cessation is a critical component for the prevention of COPD progression. FEV1 is central to the definition of COPD and classification of its severity. FEV1 is a good predictor of exercise tolerance and correlates with survival and quality of life. More rapid FEV1 decline is also predictive of morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization rates. Risk factors for accelerated decline in FEV1, in addition to smoking, include frequent exacerbations, airways reactivity, and possibly chronic systemic inflammation. Genetic components of the decline in FEV1 are being actively explored, but none has been extensively validated other than alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. To date, only smoking cessation has been definitively shown to be effective in reducing the rate of FEV1 decline, but other therapeutic strategies are under active research. Consequently, FEV1 and its change over time are important outcomes in COPD and valuable measures for the assessment of disease progression.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116Rwkyi]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometric criteria to define airflow obstruction — For diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), GOLD uses a post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7. The fixed FEV1/FVC ratio (< 0.7) may lead to over-diagnosis in the elderly and under-diagnosis in approximately 1% of young adults, especially in mild disease. If COPD is suspected in younger adults (age < 50 years) who have a repeated fixed ratio ≥ 0.7, comparing the ratio to a predicted lower limit of normal (LLN) or using z-scores may help. LLN classifies the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal, and a z-score of −1.645 is equivalent to the 5th centile. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) found that classification using z-scores versus a fixed ratio can differ and its clinical relevance remains uncertain; GLI predicted values are based on pre-bronchodilator measurements, and postbronchodilator reference values were more successful at identifying individuals with mild COPD than prebronchodilator values in SCAPIS. There are no longitudinal studies validating LLN, and using the fixed ratio is not inferior to LLN regarding prognosis; thus, GOLD favors using the fixed ratio over LLN.

Practice considerations — population and diagnostic definitions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — state that this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms and does not apply to persons with a chronic cough, sputum production, difficulty breathing, or wheezing; a postbronchodilator spirometry ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.70 confirms the presence of persistent airflow obstruction and a diagnosis of COPD in persons with appropriate symptoms and significant exposures to noxious stimuli; airflow obstruction is classified by postbronchodilator FEV1% predicted as 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe, and symptoms are categorized using scoring from standardized tools assessing symptom burden and history of exacerbations.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^117HTau4]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

The effects of a false negative diagnosis is undertreatment of patients with COPD at a point in time when they probably would benefit most (GOLD stages I and II). Table 5 summarizes the effect of classifying the presence or absence of 'COPD' according to the different methods. LLN tends to categorize elderly with mild obstruction as 'no COPD' (high specificity and low sensitivity). In absolute numbers, LLN identified fewer patients with clinically relevant prognostic events (COPD exacerbation, hospitalization, mortality) than the GOLD or panel definition. As a clinical consequence, fewer elderly patients would receive therapy targeted at reducing these events, when the clinician would apply LLN instead of the GOLD or panel diagnoses. Table 7 shows that the prognostic abilities of LLN, GOLD and panel were compatible with clearly overlapping 95% confidence intervals of the hazard ratios. Early diagnosis and identification of false negatives may enable intervention strategies as counseling for smoking cessation and exercise training when pulmonary compromise is still mild. Initiation of pharmacotherapy can reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease the number of acute exacerbations. Guidelines therefore advocate early detection of airflow limitation.

A multiple test result approach with incorporating bodyplethysmographic data seems a reasonable way to establish a more reliable diagnosis of COPD, although, we have to consider that bodyplethysmography is costly, with an average prices of 75 to 200 US Dollars per performance.

FEV1 is probably the most important determinant of obstruction, and RV/TLC is known to be highly and inversely correlated to FEV1% of predicted. Normal values of FEV1 and RV/TLC in subjects with a FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 should motivate re-evaluation of a positive diagnosis of COPD based solely on the conventional GOLD criteria. An approach many pulmonologists apply in clinical practice. As an alternative, DLCO could be used instead of RV/TLC, although more missing and indecisive results with this method were seen in our analysis and might be generally be expected (data not shown).

### The role of pulmonary function testing in the diagnosis and management of COPD [^117RW4Sb]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary function testing (PFT) has a long and rich history in the definition, diagnosis, and management of COPD. For decades, spirometry has been regarded as the standard for diagnosing COPD; however, numerous studies have shown that COPD symptoms, pathology, and associated poor outcomes can occur, despite normal spirometry. Diffusing capacity and imaging studies have called into question the need for spirometry to put the "O" (obstruction) in COPD. The role of exercise testing and the ability of PFTs to phenotype COPD are reviewed. Although PFTs play an important role in diagnosis, treatment decisions are primarily determined by symptom intensity and exacerbation history. Although a seminal study positioned FEV 1 as the primary predictor of survival, numerous studies have shown that tests other than spirometry are superior predictors of mortality. In years past, using spirometry to screen for COPD was promulgated; however, this only seems appropriate for individuals who are symptomatic and at risk for developing COPD.

Common risk factors for the development of lung cancer — age > 55 years, smoking history > 30 pack-years, presence of emphysema by computed tomography (CT) scan, presence of airflow limitation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7, body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m^2, and family history of lung cancer.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

### Should the diagnosis of COPD be based on a single spirometry test? [^111PWdM4]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines indicate that a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis is made from a single spirometry test. However, long-term stability of diagnosis based on forced expiratory volume in 1s over forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) ratio has not been reported. In primary care subjects at risk for COPD, we investigated shifts in diagnostic category (obstructed/non-obstructed). The data were from symptomatic 40+ years (ex-)smokers referred for diagnostic spirometry, with three spirometry tests, each 12 ± 2 months apart. The obstruction was based on post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < lower limit of normal (LLN) and < 0.70 (fixed ratio). A total of 2,352 subjects (54% male, post-bronchodilator FEV 1 76.5% predicted) were studied. By LLN definition, 32.2% were obstructed at baseline, but 32.2% of them were no longer obstructed at years 1 and/or 2. By fixed ratio, these figures were 46.6 and 23.8%, respectively. Overall, 14.3% of subjects changed diagnostic category by 1 year and 15.4% by 2 years when applying the LLN cut-off, and 15.1 and 14.6% by fixed ratio. Change from obstructed to non-obstructed was more likely for patients with higher body mass index (BMI) and baseline short-acting bronchodilator (SABA) users, and less likely for older subjects, those with lower FEV 1% predicted, baseline inhaled steroid users, and current smokers or SABA users at year 1. Change from non-obstructed to obstructed was more likely for males, older subjects, current smokers and patients with lower baseline FEV 1% predicted, and less likely for those with higher baseline BMI. Up to one-third of symptomatic (ex-)smokers with baseline obstruction on diagnostic spirometry had shifted to non-obstructed when routinely re-tested after 1 or 2 years. Given the implications for patients and health systems of a diagnosis of COPD, it should not be based on a single spirometry test.

Initial assessment of COPD — The goals of the initial COPD assessment are to determine the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), to guide therapy. Additional clinical assessment, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, exercise testing and/or lung imaging may be considered in COPD patients with persistent symptoms after initial treatment.

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

### Bronchodilator reversibility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: use and limitations [^113zY8n4]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

The change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator has been widely used to identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have a potentially different disease course and response to treatment. Despite the apparent simplicity of the test, it is difficult to interpret or rely on. Test performance is affected by the day of testing, the severity of baseline lung-function impairment, and the number of drugs given to test. Recent data suggest that the response to bronchodilators is not enhanced in patients with COPD and does not predict clinical outcomes. In this Review we will discuss the insight that studies of bronchodilator reversibility have provided into the nature of the COPD, and how the abnormal physiology seen in patients with this disorder can be interpreted.

Airflow obstruction assessment — post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC thresholds: Assessment of the presence or absence of airflow obstruction based on a single measurement of the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio should be confirmed by repeat spirometry on a separate occasion if the value is between 0.6 and 0.8. If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.6 it is very unlikely to rise spontaneously above 0.7.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

Screening and case-finding — indications and approaches: The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be considered as a method for early case finding. Both FEV1 and FVC predict all-cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, but data to support that population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. An randomized controlled trial (RCT) using community case-finding reported that symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD who received treatment by a pulmonologist and an educator had fewer respiratory events over one year and showed improvements in symptoms, lung function, and disease-specific quality of life, and these results suggest that such an approach, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic COPD results in better clinical outcomes. GOLD advocates active case finding, i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, but not screening spirometry, and systematic active case-finding in a primary care setting via mail-out of a screening questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients.

COPD screening of asymptomatic individuals using spirometry is described as controversial, with evidence that screening detects undiagnosed COPD but no data showing that outcomes improve among individuals identified before developing symptoms, that early treatment provides any benefit in asymptomatic individuals, or that screening is cost effective; we recommend studies that measure the accuracy of tools to detect symptoms using spirometry as the reference standard, compare outcomes for diagnostic definitions based on an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70 versus FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal, compare outcomes among symptomatic individuals with spirometry-confirmed airflow limitation and exposure history versus alternative diagnostic approaches, evaluate case-finding strategies using questionnaires, mini-spirometers, and office spirometry, examine the impact of ascertainment approach on outcomes, and evaluate the impact of age on the importance of identifying an airflow limitation (e.g., 30-yr-old vs 80-yr-old).

### Diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116F28fZ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects more than 26 million adults in the United States. Family physicians provide care for most of these patients. Cigarette smoking is the leading risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although other risk factors, including occupational and environmental exposures, account for up to one in six cases. Patients presenting with chronic cough, increased sputum production, or progressive dyspnea should be evaluated for the disease. Asthma is the disease most often confused with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is based on clinical suspicion and spirometry confirmation. A forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio that is less than 70 percent, and that is incompletely reversible with the administration of an inhaled bronchodilator, suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease severity is classified by symptomatology and spirometry. Joint guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society recommend a single quantitative test for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who remain symptomatic despite bronchodilator therapy. Other advanced testing is usually not necessary.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1119hqok]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis — spirometric criteria and thresholds emphasize that diagnosis requires confirmation of an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible via spirometry and the history of a potentially causative exposure, with airflow limitation defined by a low post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. The threshold FEV1/FVC ratio to confirm airflow limitation is described as uncertain; a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has traditionally been the criterion, which may identify airflow limitation more often in the elderly and less among young adults less than 45 years of age compared with a threshold based on the lower limit of normal of FEV1/FVC. The page notes that advocates for the fixed ratio argue it identifies patients with significant pulmonary pathology not detected by the lower limit of normal, whereas advocates for the lower limit of normal argue the fixed ratio is more likely to yield false-positive results.

For patients with COPD, specified groups include those with "elevated serum eosinophils (> 150 cells/μl or > 300 cells/μl)" and those with "frequent exacerbations (> 2/year or one hospitalization for COPD)", as well as "mucopurulent bronchitis", "severe obstruction and/or lung hyperinflation or predominant dyspnea without exacerbations", and "low level eosinophils (< 100 cells/μl) and/or pneumonia". Additional populations are "Adults ≥ 18 years who have a diagnosis of COPD and clinical indications for beta-blockers", "Adults ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of COPD who have only hypoxemia during exercise or nocturnal hypoxemia", and "Adults ≥ 18 years with COPD and an acute exacerbation". High-risk definitions include "BODE Index: Approximate 4 years survival by using BMI, FEV1, mMRC, 6MWT", use of the "Refined ABCD assessment tool in COPD: Use GOLD standard, adverse events history in 1 year, COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and mMRC", and "Patients with frequent exacerbations (> 2/year or one hospitalization for COPD)", and the table also lists "Adults with stable COPD on long-term inhaled corticosteroids".
