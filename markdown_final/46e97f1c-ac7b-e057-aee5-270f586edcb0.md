## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain, bloating, and shortness of breath. She reports undergoing ovarian stimulation as part of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment at a local fertility clinic one week ago. On examination, she is tachycardic and has evidence of ascites. The emergency department staff are unsure of the best approach to her management and whether to admit her under gynecology or medicine. There is no clear local protocol for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the unit, and the staff have difficulty contacting the fertility clinic for further information about her treatment.

Based on current guidelines, what key steps should this acute unit take to improve the assessment and management of patients presenting with suspected ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in the future?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what key steps an acute unit should take to improve the assessment and management of patients presenting with suspected ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), given that there is no local protocol and difficulty contacting the fertility clinic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and stabilization. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and severity classification. Next, I will consider disposition and admission criteria. After that, I need to outline inpatient management principles, including fluids, thromboprophylaxis, and procedural interventions. Finally, I will address system-level quality improvement, prevention, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities in triage and stabilization, because OHSS can deteriorate rapidly. I need to ensure airway and breathing are addressed, recognizing that severe ascites and pleural effusions can cause dyspnea and respiratory compromise, and that critical patients warrant resuscitation bay placement and early involvement of gynecology and, if unstable, critical care teams [^111FZP2g] [^111DtS6P]. Hold on, I should verify hemodynamic status and start isotonic crystalloids for intravascular depletion, while remembering that over-resuscitation can worsen third-spacing; hematocrit helps gauge hemoconcentration and guide fluids, and I should repeat labs if the patient worsens to track trends [^113oWcUz] [^1141vhci].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and not jump to conclusions. OHSS is a clinical diagnosis supported by history of recent ovarian stimulation, exam findings such as ascites, and imaging that shows enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles and free fluid; ultrasound is first-line, with CT or MRI reserved for complications or tumor differentiation when needed [^111b7xeH] [^113HxrSB]. Wait, let me verify severity classification because it drives disposition; standardized schemes categorize mild, moderate, severe, and critical based on symptoms, ovarian size, and laboratory derangements, and I should explicitly classify this patient given the ascites and tachycardia, which suggest at least moderate to severe disease [^111cvGkh] [^113pw2fS].

> I will now examine disposition and admission criteria, since this is where uncertainty often arises. I should confirm that admission is indicated for severe or critical OHSS, for inability to control pain, for inability to maintain fluids, for failure of outpatient management, or for unreliable follow-up; critically ill patients need intensive care and multidisciplinary input, and daily reassessment is required for inpatients with escalation for critical disease [^113wwpdW] [^111DtS6P] [^114SKaex] [^116UJrbL]. Hold on, I should verify outpatient options too; mild to moderate cases can be managed outpatient with close follow-up every 1–2 days and clear safety-netting, but this patient with ascites and tachycardia does not fit outpatient care today [^113KBSbn] [^116QAudQ].

> Let me think about inpatient management principles, starting with fluids. Isotonic crystalloids are first-line for intravascular depletion, and I should titrate to urine output and clinical perfusion while watching for fluid overload; hematocrit guides the degree of hemoconcentration and response, and I should repeat labs if the patient deteriorates [^1141vhci] [^113oWcUz]. I should double-check thromboprophylaxis because OHSS confers a hypercoagulable state; LMWH is recommended for severe or critical OHSS and for hospitalized patients, with duration individualized to risk and pregnancy status, and I must maintain vigilance for VTE even weeks after apparent recovery [^116pGqqR] [^114BeGBB] [^113rYy8d].

> For symptom control, I need to ensure adequate analgesia and antiemetics, and I should remember that NSAIDs are generally avoided if there is renal compromise or bleeding risk; dopamine agonists like cabergoline are not routinely recommended for treatment once OHSS is established, so I should not start them in this acute setting [^117A6gUk] [^111hTmd2]. But wait, what if tense ascites is driving respiratory compromise? Therapeutic paracentesis is indicated for large-volume ascites causing significant discomfort or respiratory distress, and culdocentesis can be considered when appropriate; I should coordinate with gynecology for procedural planning and safety [^113AKhFe] [^113pH4oQ].

> Next, I should review system-level quality improvement steps that would prevent future confusion. Establishing a local OHSS protocol in every acute unit that might see these patients is a key recommendation, with clear pathways for triage, diagnostics, disposition, and escalation; this should be paired with ensuring access to clinicians experienced in OHSS management and structured liaison with fertility centers to streamline communication and transfers [^114XhNpU] [^116szdLF]. Hold on, I should verify education and training needs; ED staff should receive targeted education on OHSS recognition and management, and units should maintain a roster of gynecology consultants available for urgent input, ideally with 24/7 access or a rapid-response pathway [^notfound].

> I need to ensure prevention strategies are embedded upstream, because mitigating risk before it happens reduces ED burden. For high-risk patients, GnRH antagonist protocols with GnRH agonist trigger are first-line to reduce moderate-to-severe OHSS, and elective freeze-all strategies further lower risk; individualized gonadotropin dosing based on ovarian reserve testing also decreases OHSS, and patients should be counseled on personal risk factors such as PCOS, high AMH, or prior OHSS [^113xyWJK] [^116Ehme8] [^112LaMWP] [^111rvnKS] [^115Rcqrt]. Let me reconsider adjuncts; cabergoline can be considered in high responders, and metformin in PCOS may reduce risk, though these are preventive rather than acute treatments, and cycle cancellation remains an option when risk is extreme after weighing patient-centered trade-offs [^116X2dsD] [^115sF4u2] [^113KJyJb].

> For special populations, I should confirm that pregnancy status alters risk and trajectory. Late-onset OHSS driven by endogenous hCG is more severe and prolonged, so I must ask about early pregnancy and adjust monitoring and thromboprophylaxis duration accordingly; if pregnancy is confirmed, I should coordinate obstetric follow-up and consider the maternal-fetal implications of interventions [^114D9rFE]. Hold on, I should verify that neurologic symptoms warrant a low threshold for imaging given rare but serious thromboembolic complications, including stroke, in severe OHSS [^112KgWL1].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical, reference-aligned approach for this patient and future cases. Immediate actions include resuscitation bay evaluation, IV crystalloids guided by hematocrit, analgesia and antiemetics, bedside ultrasound to confirm ascites and ovarian enlargement, and early gynecology involvement; given ascites and tachycardia, I would classify as at least moderate to severe and admit under gynecology with medicine co-management as needed, initiate LMWH, and plan daily reassessment with a low threshold for ICU transfer if respiratory or hemodynamic status worsens [^111FZP2g] [^113wwpdW] [^116pGqqR] [^116UJrbL]. Within 24 hours, I should establish a local OHSS protocol, create an ED–fertility clinic communication pathway, and schedule training for ED and nursing staff to close the loop on future presentations [^114XhNpU] [^116szdLF].

The acute unit should implement a **standardized OHSS protocol** aligned with RCOG and SOGC guidance, including severity classification, admission criteria, and multidisciplinary care pathways [^114XhNpU] [^115huf2v]. Key steps include: **establishing a local protocol** with clear severity tiers and triggers for admission; ensuring **24/7 access to gynecology and ultrasound** for rapid diagnosis and monitoring; and creating a **direct communication line** with fertility clinics for treatment details and follow-up [^116szdLF]. Staff should be trained to recognize severe features (ascites, tachycardia, dyspnea, hemoconcentration) and to initiate thromboprophylaxis, fluid management, and therapeutic paracentesis when indicated [^116pGqqR] [^113AKhFe]. Regular audits and simulation drills should be used to maintain readiness and close care gaps [^notfound].

---

## Establish a standardized OHSS protocol

- **Severity classification**: Adopt RCOG/SOGC-compatible classification (mild, moderate, severe, critical) to standardize triage and management decisions [^111cvGkh] [^113pw2fS].

- **Admission criteria**: Define clear triggers for admission, including severe or critical features, inability to control pain, vomiting preventing oral intake, or failure of outpatient management [^113wwpdW] [^115huf2v].

- **Multidisciplinary pathway**: Specify roles for gynecology, emergency medicine, critical care, and nursing, with daily inpatient assessments and escalation triggers [^114SKaex] [^116UJrbL].

---

## Ensure rapid access to diagnostics and expertise

- **Ultrasound access**: Guarantee 24/7 pelvic ultrasound to confirm diagnosis, assess ovarian size, and detect ascites or pleural effusions [^notfound].

- **Laboratory support**: Provide rapid hematocrit, electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation studies to guide fluid and thromboprophylaxis decisions [^113oWcUz].

- **Gynecology consult**: Ensure same-day gynecology input for all suspected OHSS presentations [^notfound].

---

## Implement effective communication strategies

- **Fertility clinic liaison**: Establish a direct line to fertility clinics for treatment details, medication history, and coordinated follow-up [^116szdLF].

- **Patient information**: Develop patient education materials on red flags, fluid monitoring, and when to seek care [^115oX2p9].

- **Handover tools**: Use standardized forms to communicate severity, labs, imaging, and plan to inpatient teams and clinics [^notfound].

---

## Provide targeted staff training

- **Recognition training**: Educate ED and ward staff to identify severe features (ascites, tachycardia, dyspnea, hemoconcentration) and escalate promptly [^111FZP2g].

- **Management training**: Train on fluid management, thromboprophylaxis, and indications for paracentesis or ICU transfer [^116pGqqR] [^113AKhFe] [^111DtSKd].

- **Simulation drills**: Run regular OHSS simulations to reinforce protocol use and teamwork [^notfound].

---

## Monitor quality and outcomes

Regular audits should track **admission rates, length of stay, complications, and readmissions**, with feedback to teams to drive improvement. Establish a **continuous quality improvement** process to update the protocol as evidence evolves and to address identified gaps [^notfound].

---

## Address specific challenges identified in the case

- **Protocol absence**: Develop and ratify a local OHSS protocol urgently, endorsed by gynecology, emergency medicine, and nursing leadership [^114XhNpU].

- **Communication barriers**: Create a dedicated fertility liaison role and a 24/7 hotline for treatment details and follow-up [^116szdLF].

- **Admission uncertainty**: Clarify that severe OHSS with ascites and tachycardia warrants gynecology-led admission with medicine co-management as needed [^115huf2v].

---

By implementing a **standardized protocol**, ensuring rapid diagnostics and expertise, improving communication, training staff, and monitoring outcomes, the acute unit can reliably deliver safe, timely, and coordinated OHSS care.

Individuals undergoing In Vitro Fertilization must undergo controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to produce enough quality eggs for fertility treatment. Ovarian follicular responsiveness to COH with gonadotropins is extremely variable between patients and even from cycle to cycle for the same patient. Achieving an ideal follicular response is critical to the success of assisted reproduction treatment. Patients have been classified as 'poor', 'normal' or 'high' responders, which dictate the amount of gonadotropins that they receive. It is still important to develop treatments with high efficacy, lower multiple birth rates, and a lower complication rate for each of these groups. In an era of evidence-based medicine and with special emphasis on reducing IVF risks, it is very important to find optimal and safe ovulation induction and triggering regimens for each patient population.

Detailed Description Ovarian follicular responsiveness to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins is extremely variable between patients and even from cycle to cycle for the same patient. Achieving an ideal follicular response is critical to the success of assisted reproduction treatment. Since the early years of ART, patients have been classified as 'poor', 'normal' or 'high' responders. Poor responders, in general, exhibit an inadequate response to hormonal stimulation and diminished reproductive outcome. In contrast to poor responders, high responders are characterized by an exaggerated ovarian responsiveness, accompanied by a higher risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. In most IVF clinics, "normal responders" comprise the majority of their patients. These patients are characterized by an adequate response to gonadotropins stimulation, a relatively low risk for OHSS, and a low cancellation rate.

However, even with their relatively good prognosis, it is still important to develop treatments with high efficacy, lower multiple birth rates, and a lower complication rate. In addition, ovum donors are a unique population of patients with special characteristics and challenges. These researchers emphasized the fact that pre-stimulation classification as a high responder does not optimally correlate with actual response to hormonal stimulation. Therefore, there is a need to distinguish between a) pre-stimulation assessment based on clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic parameters and antral follicle count, respectively) and b) the actual response evaluated by the number and size of recruited follicles and serum estradiol concentration. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the effect of dual triggering on IVF outcome among poor responders or OHSS occurrence in ovum donors.

become large and painful. It can affect women who are recovering from the effects of the medication given during their fertility treatment, and those who have become pregnant after treatment. Symptoms are often more severe in pregnant women. OHSS can range in severity and can be categorised as mild, moderate or severe. Mild symptoms. are common, whereby the woman feels unwell and experiences shortness of breath, abdominal pain and bloating. This is usually resolved quickly, but for 3–8% of women undergoing IVF, these symptoms can worsen to moderate or severe OHSS. Severe OHSS can lead to serious health complications needing treatment in hospital for several days or weeks, and in a small number of. women can be life-threatening. Current management of OHSS is conservative; fertility teams monitor the condition, and if severe symptoms develop the woman is admitted to hospital for intensive monitoring and/or treatment.

Introduction

A great deal of literature has recently evaluated the prevention and management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the outpatient setting, but there remains a dearth of research evaluating OHSS in the emergency department (ED) and its management.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the underlying pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of OHSS and discusses approaches to patient care in the ED based on current literature.

Discussion

OHSS is an iatrogenic complication caused by an excessive response to controlled ovarian stimulation during assisted reproductive cycles (ART). OHSS complicates up to 30% of ART cycles, and many of these patients seek initial care in the ED. Risk factors for the development of OHSS include age < 35, history of polycystic ovarian syndrome or previous OHSS, and pregnancy. Emergency physicians will be faced with several complications including ascites, abdominal compartment syndrome, renal dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic disease, and hemodynamic instability. Critical patients should be evaluated in the resuscitation bay, and consultation with the primary obstetrics/gynecology team is needed, which improves patient outcomes. This review provides several guiding principles for management of OHSS and associated complications.

Conclusions

OHSS occurs in up to 30% of IVF cycles and carries a high morbidity. Effective care of the OHSS patient begins with early diagnosis while evaluating for other diseases and complications. Understanding these complications and an approach to the management of OHSS is essential to optimizing patient care.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) staging and onset classification — OHSS is staged (mild, moderate, severe, or critical) by the severity of symptoms and laboratory findings and is further classified by timing of onset (early or late). Early-onset OHSS occurs after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), with symptoms beginning in the 4–7 days after the hCG trigger and usually resolving with menses. Late-onset OHSS typically begins at least 9 days after the hCG trigger in response to the rising hCG of pregnancy, is more severe, and significantly lengthens the course of OHSS. Severe OHSS can lead to life-threatening complications, including pleural effusion, acute renal insufficiency, and venous thromboembolism.

High-risk identification and counseling for OHSS: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome could theoretically occur in any woman undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins; however, evidence indicates that there are some women who are at a much higher risk, and it is important to identify individuals at increased risk for OHSS to facilitate implementation of strategies and appropriate counseling in advance regarding risk.

### Multiorgan failure associated with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome due to inadequate protocol optimisation: a rare but avoidable complication [^112EaNdB]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a well-recognised iatrogenic complication following controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). Mild to moderate cases are mostly managed conservatively. Severe cases of OHSS can be potentially fatal. For this reason, UK clinics providing licensed fertility treatment are obliged to follow Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority guidelines for reporting severe incidents. We present an unusually severe complication of OHSS resulting in significant morbidity. A nulligravida woman aged 25, with a 4-year history of subfertility and multiple risk factors for the development of OHSS, underwent COS. Immediately following oocyte retrieval, the patient developed symptoms of early-onset severe OHSS. The subsequent clinical deterioration of the patient precipitated multiple organ failure, including renal and hepatic dysfunction. Despite supportive management in an intensive care unit, the patient required transfer to a tertiary liver centre for specialist treatment. OHSS is a preventable complication; therefore, such an uncommon presentation of the syndrome provides important clinical lessons to be discussed.

### Emergency department utilization for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^111HSBDi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a rare, but serious, risk of assisted reproductive technologies. In severe cases, patients may present to the emergency department (ED) for assessment, treatment of related complications, and even in-patient admission. Significant effort has been made to reduce the incidence and complications of OHSS; however, it is unknown if these strategies have decreased patient presentation for treatment in the ED.

Purpose

To assess ED utilization for OHSS over time and to examine admission rates, patient demographics, and charges.

Methods

Retrospective longitudinal study utilizing data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample Database and the National ART Surveillance System. All ED visits between 2006 and 2016 with an ICD-9 or -10 diagnosis of OHSS were included. Demographics including age, geographic location, and income quartile and alternative diagnoses, admission rates, overall charges, and number of stimulation cycles annually were assessed.

Results

The number of ovarian stimulation cycles steadily increased from 2006 (n = 110,183) to 2016 (n = 157,721), while the number of OHSS-related ED visits remained relatively stable (APC 2.08, p = 0.14). Admission rates for OHSS decreased from 52.7% in 2006 to 33.1% in 2016 (APC -4.43%, p < 0.01). The average charge for OHSS-related ED visits almost doubled from 2006 to 2016 (APC 8.53, p < 0.01) and was significantly higher than charges for non-OHSS-related visits for age-matched controls (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Despite an increase in total stimulation cycles, there was no significant change in the estimated number of patients presenting to the ED; however, admission rates significantly declined. These observations suggest a possible shift in the severity and/or management of OHSS during the study period.

We present the case of a patient who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) 48 h after successful in vitro fertilization with abdominal pain, hypotension, and free fluid on an ED-focused abdominal sonogram for trauma study. This presentation is typical of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a diagnosis that may be unfamiliar to many Emergency Physicians. With the increasing frequency of in vitro fertilization procedures, this disease process is becoming more common. Numerous complications can occur with OHSS, including third-space fluid accumulation, hemoconcentration, renal failure, and thromboembolic phenomena. Vigilance is required as these patients are at increased risk of ovarian torsion, ovarian rupture with internal hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and infection. This case report provides an overview of clinical features and emergent management of OHSS.

### Prevention of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a guideline [^117NBHfs]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions — Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a known complication of controlled ovarian stimulation. Ideally, women at risk for this disorder should be identified before stimulation, and stimulation protocols should be selected that minimize the risk of OHSS. The use of GnRH antagonist protocols with a GnRH agonist to trigger final oocyte maturation is a particularly effective strategy and should be considered first-line for OHSS prevention, and other strategies that show some benefit include the use of cabergoline and cryopreservation of embryos rather than fresh transfer.

### Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome as a growing diagnostic problem in emergency department settings: a case report [^1123Pe5x]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a common complication of an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure, which is usually clinically insignificant. However, without monitoring, it can progress into a life-threatening condition. With the increasing popularity of IVF technology, patients with OHSS may begin visiting emergency departments (EDs) more frequently.

Case Report

We report the case of a patient admitted to the ED presenting with severe abdominal pain, cough, and nausea. An ultrasound examination was inconclusive. Computer tomography revealed enlarged ovaries and fluid in the pleural cavities, around the liver and spleen, between the bowel loops, and in the pelvis. This prompted physicians to review the patient's fertility issues. Consequently, the diagnosis of OHSS was made. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? When the physician knows that the patient is undergoing IVF, the diagnosis of OHSS can be straightforward; without this information, it can be difficult. Having in mind the growing demand for infertility treatment, we present this case to increase awareness of possible clinical findings and complications of OHSS as a rare consequence of IVF. OHSS diagnosed via ultrasound can reduce the emotional, financial, and health burden of infertile couples and help them to fulfill their procreation plans without unnecessary delay.

2. First Invasive Breast Cancer Risk According to IVF Treatment Characteristics by Parity Status eTable 3. Risk of First Invasive Breast Cancer or Ductal Carcinoma in Situ According to Patient Characteristics eTable
4. Risk of First Invasive Breast Cancer According to Fertility Treatment and Reproductive Characteristics Among Women Starting Fertility Treatments From 1989. cWomen in this category contributed person-time from the first IVF treatment or first gynecological visit until date of death. dFor unknown reasons, these women had originally not been identified as belonging in the IVF group; the women did not contribute person-time to the non-IVF group because IVF treatment was administered before 1989. Importance Previous studies of breast cancer risk after in vitro fertilization treatment were inconclusive due to limited follow-up. Objective To assess long-term risk of breast cancer after ovarian stimulation for IVF.

Design, Setting, and Participants. Exposures Information on ovarian stimulation for IVF, other fertility treatments, and potential confounders was collected from medical records and through mailed questionnaires. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of invasive and in situ breast cancers in women who underwent fertility treatments was obtained through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Breast cancer risk in the IVF group was compared with risks in the general population and the non-IVF group. Results Among 25 108 women, 839 cases of invasive breast cancer and 109 cases of in situ breast cancer occurred after a median follow-up of 21. 1 years. Breast cancer risk in IVF-treated women was not significantly different from that in the general population and from the risk in the non-IVF group. Because of the high incidence of breast cancer and the large numbers of women undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF, even a small risk increase would have important public health implications. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the long-term risk of breast cancer in a nationwide cohort of women treated with ovarian stimulation for IVF or other fertility treatments. A secondary aim was to examine the separate associations of subfertility diagnosis and of IVF treatment components with breast cancer risk. Question What is the long-term risk of breast cancer after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization. Findings In this cohort study that included 25 108 women who underwent fertility treatments with a median follow-up of 21. 1 years, breast cancer risk in IVF-treated women was not significantly different from that in the general population or in women who underwent other fertility treatments.

Meaning These findings are consistent with the absence of a significant increase in long-term risk of breast cancer among IVF-treated women. Most women in the non-IVF group underwent tubal surgery, intrauterine insemination, hormonal treatments, or withdrew from the waiting list for IVF. Women in the non-IVF group were included with similar subfertility diagnoses as women in the IVF group. The institutional ethical committee of each of the IVF clinics approved the study procedures, which have been previously described. 10–12. Dose-response associations were examined with total number of IVF cycles, number of follicle-stimulating hormone and human menopausal gonadotropin ampules, and numbers of oocytes collected.

### Prevention of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a guideline [^1127fK8U]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) risk — demographics and baseline characteristics: Baseline patient characteristics are helpful when assessing risk for OHSS and may allow for early counseling and risk mitigation before treatment, and a Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology database study of > 210,000 IVF cycles investigated risk factors for OHSS. Younger age, Black race, and infertility because of disorders of ovulation, tubal factor, or unexplained infertility were associated with increased risk for OHSS. Compared with white women, the risk of developing OHSS was increased for Black women (any OHSS, 1.88; severe OHSS, 2.93) and decreased for Hispanic women (any OHSS, 0.79). Although younger age has been associated with an increased risk of OHSS, among individuals hospitalized with severe OHSS, age > 40 years has been associated with an increased risk for life-threatening complications. Ovulation disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have been consistently associated with a higher incidence of OHSS, and among women with PCOS those with metabolic syndrome appear to be at lower OHSS risk than those without. Data are mixed regarding body mass index (BMI), with some studies revealing an inverse association between BMI and OHSS risk, whereas others have failed to demonstrate a relationship. Genetic predictors have been explored, with the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor N680S variant associated with increased odds of developing OHSS (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.025–2.839) in a small case-control study, and a case series of 4 individuals describing an association between variants in the FLT4 gene and OHSS.

### Critical illness in pregnancy: part I: an approach to a pregnant patient in the ICU and common obstetric disorders [^116gBgpt]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Managing critically ill obstetric patients in the ICU is a challenge because of their altered physiology, different normal ranges for laboratory and clinical parameters in pregnancy, and potentially harmful effects of drugs and interventions on the fetus. About 200 to 700 women per 100,000 deliveries require ICU admission. A systematic five-step approach is recommended to enhance maternal and fetal outcomes: (1) differentiate between medical and obstetric disorders with similar manifestations, (2) identify and treat organ dysfunction, (3) assess maternal and fetal risk from continuing pregnancy and decide if delivery/termination of pregnancy will improve outcome, (4) choose an appropriate mode of delivery if necessary, and (5) optimize organ functions for safe delivery. A multidisciplinary team including the intensivist, obstetrician, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, anesthesiologist, neonatologist, nursing specialist, and transfusion medicine expert is key to optimize outcomes. Severe preeclampsia and its complications, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome, and amniotic fluid embolism, which cause significant organ failure, are reviewed. Obstetric conditions that were not so common in the past are increasingly seen in the ICU. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of pregnancy is being diagnosed more frequently. Massive hemorrhage from adherent placenta is increasing because of the large number of pregnant women with scars from previous cesarean section. With more complex fetal surgical interventions being performed for congenital disorders, maternal complications are increasing. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is also becoming common because of treatment of infertility with assisted reproduction techniques. Part II will deal with common medical disorders and their management in critically ill pregnant women.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1166Mcnz]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a condition that can occur after ovarian stimulation, often in the context of fertility treatments. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and assessing the severity of OHSS. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality used to evaluate the ovaries, where findings typically include enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, ranging from small to large, representing enlarged follicles or corpus luteum cysts (Fig. 5). In severe cases, free fluid may be seen in the pelvis or abdomen due to capillary leakage. In more advanced stages, CT or MRI scans may be employed to assess complications such as ovarian torsion, ascites, pleural effusions or other signs of severe OHSS. Particularly, MRI is very helpful in differentiating OHSS from ovarian tumours, including choriocarcinoma, which can also produce high hCG levels, by demonstrating markedly bilateral symmetrically enlarged ovaries with simple cysts of different size, separated by thin septa and lacking inhomogeneous solid tissue consistent with malignancy (Fig. 5).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1): Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing's Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

### Prevention of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a guideline [^112LaMWP]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) — freeze-only cycles: Elective cryopreservation of all embryos and subsequent transfer in nonstimulated cycles is used to avoid the endogenous hCG rise of a fresh transfer cycle. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 125 patients showed fewer OHSS events with cryopreservation (0 vs 4) without differences in pregnancy (46% controls vs. 48% cryopreservation) or live birth (39% controls vs. 40% cryopreservation). A large multicenter RCT (n = 2,157) found similar live birth with frozen versus fresh transfer (48.7% vs 50.2%; P = 0.50) but significantly lower OHSS with cryopreservation (0.6% vs 2.0%; P = 0.005). A meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 4,712) reported reduced OHSS with a "freeze-only" strategy (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17–0.39) and likely no difference in cumulative ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75–1.19; I² = 31%). There is strong evidence that avoiding a fresh embryo transfer and cryopreserving embryos (freeze-only cycle) significantly reduces moderate-to-severe OHSS (Grade A). It is recommended to consider a freeze-only cycle and subsequent frozen embryo transfer in patients at risk for OHSS on the basis of high ovarian response or elevated serum estradiol levels, with strong strength of recommendation and A-level evidence.

### Ischemic stroke associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^112KgWL1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the most serious complication of assisted reproductive technology. Severe OHSS may be accompanied by thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary thromboembolism or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ischemic stroke may occur in rare cases.

Case Report

We report a 32-year-old woman with a recent medical history of OHSS who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of impaired consciousness. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 (E3V3M4). History taking and a thorough physical examination were impossible because of the patient's mental status. Additional medical history was obtained with the assistance of the patient's husband. Ischemic stroke was confirmed on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging performed after a basic examination and confirmation of normal findings on a noncontrast brain computed tomography scan. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although the incidence of cerebral infarction is low in younger patients, emergency physicians treating young women in the ED who have recently undergone fertility treatment or have been diagnosed with OHSS should be aware of the possibility of complications caused by OHSS. Specifically, if these patients complain of traditional or nontraditional neurologic symptoms during an ED visit, stroke should be strongly suspected. This awareness will reduce the incidence of sequelae through prompt examination and treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full guideline and the technical reports and outlined in Figure 1 and available at. The process aligns with all elements of the AGREEII tool for quality guideline assessment. This involved extensive evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework covering evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice. Categories include evidence-based or consensus recommendations with accompanying clinical practice points (Table 1).

Terms include "should", "could", and "should not", are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and quality of the evidence and are independent descriptors reflecting the judgement of the multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG), including consumers. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms, and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. "Could" is used where either the quality of evidence was limited or the available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. "Should not" is used where there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms may outweigh the benefits.

The GRADE of the recommendation is determined by the guideline development group based on comprehensive structured consideration of all elements of the GRADE framework, including desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, resource requirements and cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility and includes:

* Conditional recommendation against the option;
 Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison;
* Conditional recommendation for the option;
 Strong recommendation for the option.

Quality of the evidence is categorized according to: the number and design of studies addressing the outcome; judgments about the quality of the studies and/or synthesized evidence, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and any other considerations that may influence the quality of the evidence; key statistical data; and classification of the importance of the outcomes (Table 2). The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence in an estimate of the effect to support a particular recommendation and was largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111eWN1T]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — assisted reproduction with in vitro maturation (IVM) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): The use of in vitro maturation (IVM) and ICSI could be considered in women with PCOS as an alternative to a stimulated IVF/ICSI cycle; where an embryo is frozen and replaced in a subsequent embryo transfer cycle, acknowledging there is no risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but a lower cumulative live birth rate. The use of IVM and ICSI could be considered prior to stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles acknowledging both benefits and limitations. IVM should only be considered in services with sufficient expertise, and advocacy is needed for regional or national centres of expertise. IVM could be offered as an option in women with prior severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and where the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is deemed unacceptably high, provided that expertise in IVM techniques exists. Evidence suggests that IVM/ICSI is less effective than standard IVF/ICSI in terms of clinical pregnancy per patient and live birth rate per patient.

### Preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: guidance for the clinician [^114Ymqu5]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To reevaluate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) prevention techniques and provide a classification system for grading OHSS and evidence-based treatment strategies for preventing OHSS.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles published in the last 5 years using the keywords "controlled ovarian stimulation", "controlled ovarian hyperstimulation", "ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome", "OHSS", "prevention", "chorionic gonadotropin", "hCG", "GnRH agonist", "GnRH antagonist", "coasting", and "cryopreservation". We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective studies, pilot studies, case studies, reviews, and meta-analyses.

Result(S)

There is a shortage of large, prospective RCTs reporting OHSS prediction and prevention strategies. Our review showed that risk factors such as antral follicle count and baseline anti-Müllerian hormone level may identify women at high OHSS risk. Preventative strategies that appear highly effective at reducing or preventing OHSS include GnRH antagonist protocols and the use of GnRH agonists to trigger final oocyte maturation. Moreover, alternative therapies, such as dopamine receptor agonists (Cabergoline), have also emerged as potential new treatment modalities in the management of this disease.

Conclusion(S)

These findings suggest that current treatment guidelines should be updated to incorporate findings from recent literature that show that GnRH antagonist protocols consistently reduce OHSS and that GnRH agonist triggering has considerable promise in preventing OHSS, although further RCTs will be needed to confirm this.

### An unusual cause of tachycardia, hypotension, and intraabdominal free fluid: ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^113zb9Sp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report a case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in a 37-year-old female who had recently underwent assisted reproductive technology involving oocyte retrieval. Her emergency department (ED) presentation, clinical course, and a discussion of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are also presented. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a critical diagnosis in emergency medicine, and emergency physicians must consider it in the differential for any female nontrauma patient presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal pain.
