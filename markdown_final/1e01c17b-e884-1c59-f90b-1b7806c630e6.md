## Question

Muscle Spams

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about muscle spasms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and distinguishing spasm from cramp, spasticity, and contracture. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology across neurogenic, musculoskeletal, and drug-induced etiologies. Next, I will review diagnostic evaluation, including history, exam, and when to order labs or imaging. After that, I need to examine treatment by etiology, starting with nonpharmacologic measures, then pharmacologic options, and finally interventional therapies. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety, and synthesize a practical algorithm with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Muscle spasms are involuntary contractions that can be brief or sustained, and they overlap with but are not identical to cramps, which are typically sudden, painful, and self-limited; spasticity reflects velocity-dependent hypertonia from upper motor neuron lesions; and contractures are fixed shortening of muscle or soft tissues that limit range and can mimic spasm, so I need to keep these distinctions in mind during evaluation and treatment planning.

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, because mechanism drives therapy. Neurogenic spasms arise from hyperexcitable motor neurons or circuits, including peripheral nerve hyperexcitability in cramps and central mechanisms in spasticity and painful tonic spasms; musculoskeletal spasms often reflect protective splinting, ischemia, or electrolyte shifts; and drug-induced spasms, such as with hedgehog pathway inhibitors, involve calcium-mediated excitability and cytoskeletal disruption, which explains why magnesium and dose modification can help [^3fb1e3c5] [^76b02b73] [^b6be28e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without a structured evaluation. I need to check the history for triggers, timing, distribution, and associated symptoms; the exam for hyperreflexia, clonus, fasciculations, or fixed contractures; and selectively order labs such as electrolytes, renal, hepatic, thyroid, and glucose when indicated; imaging is reserved for focal deficits, trauma, or red flags, and I should remember that many musculoskeletal spasms are non-specific and do not require extensive testing [^72827615].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic foundations because they are first-line and often sufficient. Stretching reduces cramp severity in older adults, though effects on frequency are uncertain; hydration and electrolyte optimization are prudent; physical therapy improves range, strength, and function; and thermotherapy can transiently reduce tone and spasm, though long-term benefits are unclear, so I need to set expectations accordingly [^723eb7e1] [^23f4aba6] [^1e120b31].

> Let me consider pharmacologic options for acute musculoskeletal spasm, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Cyclobenzaprine 5–10 mg three times daily improves pain and spasm versus placebo, with 5 mg offering comparable efficacy and less sedation; tizanidine is reasonable when sedation is undesirable; and tolperisone 200 mg three times daily shows promise with low somnolence in phase 2 data, though I should confirm availability and labeling before recommending it routinely [^dd423176] [^26f2bb9a].

> Wait, I initially thought skeletal muscle relaxants were broadly effective for chronic low back pain, but I should correct that. High-quality evidence shows limited or no benefit of SMRs for chronic nonspecific low back pain, whereas short-term use may help acute spasm; long-term SMR use carries risks of sedation, falls, and misuse, so I need to limit duration, reassess frequently, and deprescribe if goals are not met [^48cd4327] [^29caf2e7].

> For spasticity from upper motor neuron injury, I need to ensure I escalate thoughtfully. Oral baclofen, tizanidine, and benzodiazepines can reduce tone and spasms, but sedation and weakness limit titration; intrathecal baclofen is appropriate for severe, refractory cases with careful selection and monitoring; botulinum toxin is first-line for focal spasticity; and cannabinoids have moderate-quality evidence for MS-related spasticity and can be considered as adjuncts when other therapies are inadequate [^1250d97c] [^9d3bf7e3] [^8df1cee6] [^ed9bdfd5].

> But wait, what if the spasms are drug-induced. With hedgehog pathway inhibitors, I should confirm early onset, monitor creatine kinase, and try hydration, magnesium, dose reduction or alternate-day dosing, and gabapentin; case series suggest these strategies reduce severity and discontinuation, though evidence quality is limited, so I should individualize and document response [^f06c44fb] [^400eea0b].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In older adults, most SMRs are on Beers lists; tizanidine is relatively better tolerated, and benzodiazepines should generally be avoided; in pediatrics, management is multimodal with emphasis on function and caregiver training; in ALS, stretching and oral antispastics are reasonable, but intrathecal baclofen evidence is insufficient; in pregnancy, quinine is avoided and stretching is preferred; and in trauma, short-course SMRs may reduce spasm and opioid requirements, but I must monitor for sedation and falls [^a872170f] [^99715e7e] [^065b65f7] [^3d12d077] [^c23c15f7].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and monitoring. Sedation, dizziness, and anticholinergic effects are common with SMRs; falls and fractures are a particular concern in older adults; combining SMRs with opioids increases overdose risk; and for spasticity, I should use standardized measures and goal attainment scaling to track function and adjust therapy iteratively [^fb221442] [^a872170f] [^48cd4327] [^0272966a] [^da914ef0].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check that it aligns with evidence. Start with education, stretching, hydration, and activity modification; for acute musculoskeletal spasm, consider a short course of cyclobenzaprine 5 mg three times daily or tizanidine 2–4 mg at bedtime, reassessing within 1–2 weeks; for spasticity, optimize oral agents and consider botulinum toxin for focal symptoms; for refractory cases, evaluate for intrathecal baclofen; for drug-induced spasms, modify the offending agent and add magnesium or gabapentin; and throughout, set measurable functional goals and reassess at each visit to decide on continuation, tapering, or escalation [^fb221442] [^1250d97c] [^8df1cee6] [^f06c44fb] [^0272966a].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and deprescribing triggers. Reassess efficacy and adverse effects within 2–3 weeks of initiating SMRs, discontinue if no meaningful benefit, and avoid chronic use unless there is a compelling, documented indication; for spasticity, schedule regular reviews to align interventions with evolving goals and comorbidities, and document objective changes to justify ongoing therapy [^48cd4327] [^0272966a].

Muscle spasms are **involuntary, often painful contractions** of skeletal muscle, commonly due to overuse, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or nerve irritation [^823f89a7]. Most spasms resolve with stretching, hydration, and correction of electrolytes; persistent or severe spasms warrant evaluation for underlying causes such as neuropathy, metabolic disturbances, or medication effects [^72827615]. For acute relief, **short-term use of muscle relaxants** (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine) is reasonable, but long-term use is discouraged due to limited efficacy and CNS side effects [^48cd4327] [^fb221442]. Nonpharmacologic measures — stretching, massage, and heat — are first-line, and quinine may be considered for refractory nocturnal leg cramps after weighing risks [^723eb7e1] [^3d12d077]. Management should be individualized, with attention to triggers, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^28180920].

---

## Pathophysiology

Muscle spasms arise from **abnormal motor neuron excitability** and sustained muscle fiber contraction; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia increase excitability and precipitate spasms [^2b9747a5].
- **Neuromuscular fatigue**: Overuse or prolonged activity alters neuromuscular transmission and promotes cramping [^3b48422e].
- **Neurological disorders**: Upper motor neuron lesions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) cause spasticity and spasms via disinhibition of spinal reflexes [^00abbc40].
- **Medication-induced spasms**: Drugs such as statins, diuretics, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors can provoke cramps via metabolic or neuromuscular effects [^9f979f03] [^df84f215].

---

## Clinical presentation

Muscle spasms typically present with:

- **Sudden onset**: Involuntary, often painful contraction of a single muscle or muscle group [^823f89a7].
- **Duration**: Seconds to minutes, occasionally longer in pathological states [^823f89a7].
- **Associated symptoms**: Localized pain, tenderness, and transient loss of function [^823f89a7].
- **Triggers**: Exercise, fatigue, dehydration, cold exposure, or specific movements [^3b48422e].

---

## Common causes and risk factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Physiological | - Dehydration <br/> - Electrolyte imbalance (Na, K, Mg, Ca) <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Overexertion [^2b9747a5] [^3b48422e] |
| Neurological | - Multiple sclerosis <br/> - Spinal cord injury <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy <br/> - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^00abbc40] [^2b9747a5] |

| Medication-induced | - Statins <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors <br/> - Hormone therapy [^9f979f03] [^df84f215] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Muscle strain <br/> - Overuse injuries <br/> - Poor posture <br/> - Myofascial pain syndrome [^ce1cb70e] [^f4c5bbd8] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Most muscle spasms are benign and self-limited; persistent, severe, or recurrent spasms warrant a focused evaluation:

- **History**: Onset, duration, frequency, triggers, associated symptoms, medication use, and comorbidities [^823f89a7].
- **Physical examination**: Inspection for muscle bulk, tone, fasciculations; palpation for tenderness or trigger points; neurologic exam for weakness, sensory loss, or reflex changes [^notfound].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes (Na, K, Mg, Ca), renal and liver function, thyroid panel, glucose, and CK if rhabdomyolysis is suspected [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Reserved for suspected structural lesions or when red flags are present (e.g. MRI for spinal cord or nerve root compression) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are **first-line** and effective for most patients:

- **Stretching**: Gentle stretching of the affected muscle, especially for nocturnal leg cramps, reduces frequency and severity [^723eb7e1].
- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake, particularly with electrolyte replacement, prevents cramps associated with dehydration or electrolyte loss [^df84f215].
- **Massage and heat**: Local massage and heat application relax muscle fibers and relieve spasms [^notfound].
- **Physical therapy**: Targeted exercises to improve flexibility, strength, and posture reduce recurrence [^99715e7e].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacotherapy is reserved for **persistent or severe spasms** unresponsive to conservative measures:

- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use of cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, or methocarbamol provides symptomatic relief in acute musculoskeletal spasms; long-term use is discouraged due to limited efficacy and CNS side effects [^48cd4327] [^fb221442].
- **Quinine**: Modestly effective for nocturnal leg cramps but associated with rare serious adverse effects (e.g. arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia); use is restricted and requires careful risk-benefit assessment [^3d12d077].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Diazepam or clonazepam may be used short-term for severe spasms, particularly in neurological conditions, but caution is advised due to sedation, dependence, and fall risk [^1250d97c] [^39a1be3c].
- **Botulinum toxin**: Effective for focal spasticity and dystonia-related spasms, providing sustained relief with repeated injections [^8df1cee6] [^52d683c5].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Most muscle spasms resolve spontaneously or with conservative care; chronic or severe spasms can cause **muscle injury, reduced function, and impaired quality of life**. Persistent spasms may signal underlying pathology requiring targeted therapy [^72827615].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **addressing modifiable risk factors**:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte balance, especially during exercise or heat exposure [^df84f215].
- **Stretching**: Regular stretching, particularly before and after exercise, reduces cramp frequency [^723eb7e1].
- **Ergonomics**: Optimize workplace and posture to reduce repetitive strain and overuse [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Identify and adjust drugs that predispose to cramps when feasible [^notfound].

---

Muscle spasms are common, usually benign, and often self-limited; **most respond to stretching, hydration, and electrolyte correction**. Persistent or severe spasms warrant evaluation for underlying causes, and management should be individualized, prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies and reserving medications for refractory cases.

### The management of pain in spasticity [^f840e556]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is a common feature of spasticity and muscle spasms and the reasons for this are discussed in this article. However, the causes of this spasticity have to be determined and for successful management, knowing the underlying mechanisms, which produce spasticity, is necessary. In addition to knowing the range of available treatments, one has to know their particular contribution to the overall management of the patient. The assessment and management of the spastic patient is multi-disciplinary and painful spasticity changes over time. This therefore requires repeated assessments and the direction of the treatment may also change. Pain may be a dominant feature, but is rarely the sole symptom. This article looks at a strategy for the overall management of the patient with the focus on managing pain.

### Muscle cramps [^b9116cd0]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle. These true cramps, which originate from peripheral nerves, may be distinguished from other muscle pain or spasm. Medical history, physical examination, and a limited laboratory screen help to determine the various causes of muscle cramps. Despite the "benign" nature of cramps, many patients find the symptom very uncomfortable. Treatment options are guided both by experience and by a limited number of therapeutic trials. Quinine sulfate is an effective medication, but the side-effect profile is worrisome, and other membrane-stabilizing drugs are probably just as effective. Patients will benefit from further studies to better define the pathophysiology of muscle cramps and to find more effective medications with fewer side-effects.

### Muscle cramps and contractures: causes and treatment [^72827615]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps are painful, sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that are generally self-limiting. They are often part of the spectrum of normal human physiology and can be associated with a wide range of acquired and inherited causes. Cramps are only infrequently due to progressive systemic or neuromuscular diseases. Contractures can mimic cramps and are defined as shortenings of the muscle resulting in an inability of the muscle to relax normally, and are generally myogenic. General practitioners and neurologists frequently encounter patients with muscle cramps but more rarely those with contractures. The main questions for clinicians are: (1) Is this a muscle cramp, a contracture or a mimic? (2) Are the cramps exercise induced, idiopathic or symptomatic? (3) What is/are the presumed cause(s) of symptomatic muscle cramps or contractures? (4) What should be the diagnostic approach? and (5) How should we advise and treat patients with muscle cramps or contractures? We consider these questions and present a practical approach to muscle cramps and contractures, including their causes, pathophysiology and treatment options.

Common Causes for LBP

Common causes for LBP include muscle spasm, disc pathology, nerve root impingement (resulting in radiculopathy), spinal stenosis (with or without neurogenic claudication), and joint issues involving the intraarticular facet or sacroiliac joints. More advanced pathological causes of acute and chronic LBP include vertebral fractures, axial spondyloarthropathies, cancer metastases, and spinal infections. However, most people suffer with CLBP that has no recognized specific cause. The cervical and lumbar paravertebral region contain many muscle groups, which control nearly all spinal motions and posture. Physical and mental stressors contribute to spasm of these muscles, with resulting postural changes and non-specific pain. There are a multitude of treatments available for nonspecific CLBP, some of which will be reviewed below. Chemical radiculitis may be the source of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic disease without radiographic evidence of disc herniation. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently document asymptomatic findings, including disc herniations in 20% of patients without LBP less than age 60 years and 36% above age 60. Symptomatic findings on MRI may include disc herniation or high-intensity zone lesions which are often considered as pain generators. While exact mechanisms are poorly understood, evidence indicates that multiple pathophysiological pathways are associated with non-specific LBP. For example, gluteal muscle spasm can lead to symptoms suggestive of radicular pain, or "pseudo-sciatica" symptoms often referred to as piriformis syndrome. Another challenging fact is that discogenic pain may only be axial in nature; studies have shown a correlation between vertebral endplate (Modic) changes seen on MRI scans and LBP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-back pain because of paraspinous muscle spasm: a physician roundtable [^29e6f57b]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines to diagnose and treat acute low-back pain, practical application is nonuniform and physician uncertainty regarding best practices is widespread.

Objective

The objective of this study was to further optimal treatment choices for screening, diagnosing, and treating acute low-back pain caused by paraspinous muscle spasm.

Methods

Four experts in pain medicine (three family physicians and one physiatrist) participated in a roundtable conference call on October 18, 2010, to examine current common practices and guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute low-back pain and to offer commentary and examples from their clinical experience.

Results

Participants discussed the preferred choices and timing of diagnostic and imaging tests, nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid and opioid medication use, biopsychosocial evaluation, complementary therapies, and other issues related to treatment of acute low-back pain. Principal clinical recommendations to emerge included thorough physical exam and medical history, early patient mobilization, conservative use of imaging tests, early administration of muscle relaxants combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and spasm, and a strong emphasis on patient education and physician-patient communication.

Conclusions

Early, active management of acute low-back symptoms during the initial onset may lead to better patient outcomes, reducing related pain and disability and, possibly, preventing progression to chronicity.

### The athlete with muscular cramps: clinical approach [^3b48422e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, spasmodic contractions of the skeletal muscle. Although cramps are a common clinical complaint, their etiology and management have not been well established. Exercise-associated muscle cramps occur during or immediately following exercise, and they are associated with muscular fatigue and shortened muscle contraction. The main challenges for treating physicians are to identify whether the complaint represents a true muscle cramp as well as to rule out the presence of an underlying serious clinical condition. Muscle cramps may be a symptom of any of several conditions, including radiculopathies, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, vascular problems, electrolyte disorders, and metabolic myopathies. Cramps also may occur as a side effect of certain drugs (eg, lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensives, beta-agonists, insulin, oral contraceptives, alcohol). Most athletes who experience exercise-associated muscle cramps are healthy individuals without systemic illness. Therapy should focus on preventing premature fatigue by means of appropriate nutrition and adequate training.

### A summary of spasticity management – a treatment algorithm [^4c7169ec]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The muscle overactivity seen in spasticity results in limb stiffness and muscle spasm, to which there is both a neurogenic and a biomechanical component. Spasticity does not always cause harm and can assist in the rehabilitation process enabling a patient to stand when their limb weakness would not otherwise allow it. When it does cause harm, however, treatment is required. This aims to (i) prevent provocative factors (ii) treat muscle overactivity; and (iii) prevent complications. Untreated, limb contracture, pain and other complications occur and early management can be most effective. Treatment is essentially physical, but, when this is inadequate, pharmacological intervention may be required. A strategy has been devised which shows that the first choice pharmacological treatment of focal spasticity is botulinum toxin. Over the past decade, the choice of treatment has become more ambitious with the establishment of new technologies. Good management now depends on an understanding of their role and application in relation to the needs of individual patients. To this end, a treatment algorithm which covers the salient facts in patient assessment and gives the indications for the range of available treatments, is the best approach. The indications and limitations of the available treatments are discussed, along with their place in the overall management of the patients. The evidence base for much of what is done is not strong and this summary examines the activities of proven value and of consensus view.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — muscle spasms, cramps, or musculoskeletal pain during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy: Patients should monitor and report symptoms. Supportive care interventions are to evaluate levels of potassium, calcium, and phosphate; correct serum electrolyte abnormalities and consider potassium and calcium supplements; consider non-pharmacologic interventions (eg, adequate hydration, stretching/gentle exercise, and tonic water); and assess serum creatine kinase (CK) levels.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^7a6c953c]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for muscle cramps, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation (muscle spasticity), AAPMR 2024 guidelines recommend to reassess spasticity throughout the treatment course, particularly before or at the time of each treatment to determine whether to maintain or modify treatment.

### A mechanism-based classification of pain in multiple sclerosis [^76b02b73]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Painful tonic spasms

This type of pain is specific to MS. Painful tonic spasms are unilateral or bilateral, stereotyped, involuntary muscle contractions that last less than 2 min and may manifest several times a day. These spasms usually continue for weeks or months and then disappear. They can be triggered by touch, movement, hyperventilation, or emotions, and are, though seldom, preceded by a "somesthesic aura". They may start from the face, arm, or leg, and spread to the adjacent part of the body. Their prevalence ranges from 6 to 11%. Painful tonic spasms are more common in primary and secondary progressive forms of the disease and their presence correlates positively with age, disease duration, and disability. The spasms originate in the central nervous system from hyperactivity in the central motor fibers, caused by lesions in the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, medulla, or spinal cord.

Although no direct evidence exists, the typically spasmodic muscle contraction suggests ectopically generated high-frequency discharges. Hence, the ideal drugs would be frequency-dependent, voltage-gated, sodium-channel blockers. Accordingly, one controlled trial reported the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine and oral mexiletine. Because of simultaneous activation of adjacent motor units as in muscles cramps, the spasmodic muscle contraction induces extreme vasculature compression, ischemia, and thus activates the muscle nociceptors sensitive to ischemia, eventually giving rise to nociceptive pain (ischemic muscle pain). As soon as the spasm ends the blood flow returns to normal and pain quickly recedes. Cannabinoids, theoretically effective on both neuropathic and nociceptive components, are indeed efficacious, and are more efficacious in painful tonic spasms than the purely neuropathic pains in patients with MS.

### Muscular cramp: causes and management [^3ca0b9cd]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Muscular cramp is a common symptom in healthy people, especially among the elderly and in young people after vigorous or peak exercise. It is prominent in a number of benign neurological syndromes. It is a particular feature of chronic neurogenic disorders, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A literature review was undertaken to understand the diverse clinical associations of cramp and its neurophysiological basis, taking into account recent developments in membrane physiology and modulation of motor neuronal excitability. Many aspects of cramping remain incompletely understood and require further study. Current treatment options are correspondingly limited.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^00abbc40]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R spasticity guidance — definitions and scope outlines evolving definitions and mechanisms of spasticity and frames the guidance's intent. Lance's 1980 consensus defined spasticity as "a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome". Subsequent work redefined it as "disordered sensorimotor control, resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion, presenting as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles", and a more recent definition states it is "manifested as velocity- and muscle length–dependent increase in resistance to externally imposed muscle stretch" due to "hyperexcitable descending excitatory brainstem pathways", with related impairments that "coexist with spasticity". The text emphasizes that "abnormal excitability of the stretch reflex is still the central mechanism" and that spasticity "may also be defined as a type of hypertonia as part of the upper motor neuron syndrome", which can manifest as "hyperreflexia, clonus, co-contractions, spreading of reflexes, spastic dystonia, associated reactions, motor overflow, and muscle spasms". It positions this as an American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R) guidance providing "consensus-based recommendations", and advises that "every care team member should continuously measure and analyze outcomes to adjust care pathways to optimize outcomes aligned with patient goals".

### Evaluation of the tolerability of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors in the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma: a narrative review of treatment strategies [^b6be28e3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Muscle Spasms and Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations

Muscle spasms usually occur early in treatment with HHIs, worsen with length of therapy, and are a common reason for patient discontinuation. Two underlying mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between HHIs and muscle spasms (Fig. 2). In the first mechanism, HHI-induced Smoothened inhibition activates noncanonical Hedgehog signaling pathways, which enhances calcium influx into myocytes and increases muscle contractility. The other proposed mechanism involves myofibroblasts, which act as a scaffold for skeletal muscle cells. Hedgehog pathway inhibition decreases the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and production of E-cadherin by myofibroblasts, leading to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and to muscle contraction. This hypothesis is particularly relevant to aggressive BCC subtypes, which have increased α-SMA expression correlating with tumor invasiveness.

### Latest approaches for the treatment of spasticity and autonomic dysreflexia in chronic spinal cord injury [^a8d62e36]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Two of the most prevalent secondary complications following spinal cord injury (SCI), besides loss of function and/or sensation below the level of injury, are uncontrolled muscle spasticity and hypertensive autonomic dysreflexia. Despite the desires of the SCI community, there have been few advances in the treatment and/or management of these fundamental impediments to the quality of life associated with chronic SCI. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to focus on current drug treatment strategies that alleviate symptoms of spasticity and autonomic dysfunction. Subsequently, looking ahead, we discuss whether individuals suffering from autonomic dysreflexia and/or muscle spasms can take certain compounds that specifically and rapidly block the neurotransmission of pain into the injured spinal cord to get rapid relief for both aberrant reflexes for which painful stimuli below the level of SCI are common precipitants.

### Positive muscle phenomena – diagnosis, pathogenesis and associated disorders [^3fb1e3c5]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Positive muscle phenomena arise owing to various forms of spontaneous muscle hyperactivity originating in motor neurons or in the muscle itself. Although they are common in a wide range of neurological and non-neurological diseases, clinical and scientific data on these phenomena are limited, and their presence is sometimes overlooked. This gap in our knowledge hampers effective diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we review the clinical characteristics and approach to diagnosis of the various positive muscle phenomena, and discuss their genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological mechanisms. Finally, we outline an algorithm to discriminate between the different positive muscle phenomena.

### Tolperisone for the treatment of acute muscle spasm of the back: results from the dose-ranging phase 2 STAR study (NCT03802565) [^26f2bb9a]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

Acute muscle spasm of the back, the leading cause of disability worldwide, is a common reason for seeking medical care. The use of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) for acute muscle spasm is common but is confounded by central nervous system adverse events, such as somnolence. Tolperisone, an SMR being developed in the United States, does not appear to be associated with somnolence. In the STAR (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03802565), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, the safety and efficacy of tolperisone compared with placebo was evaluated in subjects with acute muscle spasm of the back. Subjects (tolperisone, n = 337; placebo, n = 78) were enrolled at 38 US clinical sites. Tolperisone was well tolerated, with adverse events in 18.1% of subjects receiving tolperisone compared with 14.1% of subjects receiving placebo. Importantly, the rate of somnolence was comparable between tolperisone-treated subjects (1.2%) and subjects receiving placebo (2.6%). Linear test of trend on the least-squares mean difference (treatment-placebo) for the mean change from baseline in day 14 numeric rating scale score of pain "right now" (the primary efficacy endpoint) approached statistical significance (p = 0.0539). In an analysis of pairwise estimates (treatment-placebo), the greatest numerical difference and significance were observed for tolperisone 200 mg TID (p = 0.0040). Several secondary endpoints trended toward significance for the tolperisone 200 mg group versus placebo. Given the lack of somnolence and the effective relief of pain, tolperisone 200 mg TID may be promising for the treatment and management of acute muscle spasm.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^c57db218]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Spasticity, muscle spasms, and dystonia in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system (SNI) may coexist with or be influenced by chronic pain sources, and a multimodal approach may be beneficial. In children with SNI and recurrent pain behaviors, it can be unclear whether associated spasticity or dystonia are the direct cause of pain behaviors or if a chronic pain source is triggering observed changes in tone and movement, and when pain behaviors coexist with spasticity or dystonia, children with SNI may benefit from a multimodal approach, including interventions directed at chronic pain sources as well as spasticity or dystonia. Spasticity is defined as hypertonia in which stretching the muscle at increasing speed results in higher tone or resistance to externally imposed movement, is often not painful but over time can result in painful musculoskeletal injury, and intense muscle spasms can result in intermittent pain, with spasticity and muscle spasms increased by acute illness and pain. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that lead to repetitive twisting movements and/or abnormal postures, is not typically painful, and pain from any source can increase movements associated with dystonia.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^0272966a]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^9f979f03]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

We were able to minimise biases by restricting our analyses to large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy versus placebo in which there was systematic and unbiased event reporting. To overcome the potential bias arising from the selected publication of results, we obtained details of all adverse events related to muscle recorded in each individual trial participant, and coded them using the common nosological standard (from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). The availability of individual participant data permitted more detailed analyses of risk for each statin than have previously been possible, including analyses examining the effects on particular symptoms, the timing of any excess risk, and the variation in treatment effects in different types of patients. Statin regimens caused a small relative increase (3%) in the number of first reports of muscle symptoms, but the excess of reports due to statin therapy was largely confined to the first year of treatment, during which there was an absolute excess rate of 11 (95% CI 6–16) events per 1000 person-years. Statins had similar effects on a range of reported muscle symptoms, including myalgia, muscle cramps or spasm, limb pain, and other musculoskeletal pain. There was no evidence for variation in the relative effects of different statins. The relative increase in the rate of muscle symptoms was similar in a wide range of trial participants, and was irrespective of the variation in the methods used to ascertain symptoms, suggesting that the observed relative effects of statins on muscle symptoms are likely to be generalisable. Overall, for the regimens studied in these trials, the increase in symptoms was greater for more intensive statin regimens, and a small excess risk was likely to persist for longer, than for less intensive or moderate-intensity regimens. Based on previous analyses of these trials, this excess risk of muscle symptoms is greatly outweighed by the known cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy.

### Epileptic spasms: a variety of etiologies and associated syndromes [^d4a9d82d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Epileptic spasms have been described as a paroxysmal epileptic seizure type that consists of a series of motor movements, involving sudden flexion or extension predominantly of axial and/or proximal limb muscles, occurring with a noticeable periodicity, outside the age of infantile spasms, but have otherwise not been well characterized or described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with epileptic spasms to describe the etiology and best treatment regimen for this seizure type. Twenty-eight children fit the selection criteria for this study, and their charts and electroencephalography (EEG) results were reviewed. Data regarding onset of seizures, characteristics of seizures, duration of seizures, activity at onset, treatments tried and/or failed, genetic or metabolic workup, and results of any imaging studies were collected. The results indicate that the genetic and metabolic workups that were done were most often negative or unrevealing. In addition, treatment regimens varied greatly from patient to patient, and it is evident that these seizures are refractory to many standard anticonvulsants, as well as the ketogenic diet. The results of imaging from this series point to a variety of structural abnormalities that could possibly explain a structural versus metabolic etiology for epileptic spasms. In conclusion, epileptic spasms remain an elusive seizure type to classify, diagnose, and treat. The results of the current series show a relationship between structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resultant epileptic spasms, which has further implications regarding surgical treatment of these seizures as opposed to the traditional treatment with anticonvulsants, to which epileptic spasms remain refractory.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^2420456b]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Introduction — evolving definitions and mechanisms of spasticity summarize that terminology has progressed from a 1980 consensus definition to broader neuroanatomical concepts. In 1980, Lance and colleagues defined spasticity as a motor disorder with a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes and exaggerated tendon jerks due to stretch reflex hyperexcitability within the upper motor neuron syndrome; it was later redefined as disordered sensorimotor control from an upper motor neuron lesion with intermittent or sustained involuntary muscle activation. A more recent definition describes spasticity as a velocity- and muscle length–dependent increase in resistance to externally imposed muscle stretch that results from hyperexcitable descending excitatory brainstem pathways, with related motor impairments that coexist with spasticity. The page emphasizes that abnormal stretch reflex excitability is the central mechanism and notes spasticity may also be defined as a type of hypertonia within the upper motor neuron syndrome with manifestations including hyperreflexia, clonus, co-contractions, spreading of reflexes, spastic dystonia, associated reactions, motor overflow, and muscle spasms.

What are the possible side effects of MAXALT?

Like all prescription drugs, MAXALT can cause side effects. In studies, MAXALT was generally well-tolerated. The side effects were usually mild and temporary. The following is not a complete list of side effects reported with MAXALT. Do not rely on this leaflet alone for information about side effects. Ask your doctor to discuss with you the more complete list of side effects.

In studies, the most common side effects reported were:

dizziness
sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue
pain or pressure sensation (e.g., in the chest or throat)

If you experience dizziness, sleepiness, tiredness or fatigue, you should evaluate your ability to perform complex tasks such as driving or operating heavy machinery.

Other, less common side effects reported in studies or general use were related to the:

Heart and blood vessels - Alterations in heartbeat, increased blood pressure and spasm of blood vessels of the extremities including coldness and numbness of the hands or feet.

Muscles - Muscle weakness, stiffness, and spasm; and muscle and bone pain.

Nervous system - Nervousness, decreased mental sharpness, tremor, headache, abnormal sensation, vertigo, sleep disturbance, mood and personality changes, alterations in speech and movement, memory impairment, confusion, dream abnormality and seizure.

### Tolperisone for the treatment of acute muscle spasm of the back: results from the dose-ranging phase 2 STAR study (NCT03802565) [^a5873a12]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute muscle spasm is associated with a wide range of conditions, including back pain. Back pain is common and has a global lifetime prevalence of approximately 38.9%; it is a frequent reason for seeking medical care and represents a leading cause of disability.

Treatment approaches for acute muscle spasm include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs).SMRs have been commonly prescribed for decades, and while they do provide meaningful short-term pain relief, their use is confounded by high rates of central nervous system (CNS) adverse events (AEs), primarily somnolence. Consequently, SMRs carry warnings about the risk of driving and operating heavy machinery while using them. Opioids are also used but are associated with addiction and public health issues.

Tolperisone, a centrally acting, nonopioid, oral SMR, has been available in Europe and Asia for decades; at doses up to 900 mg/day, it has been used to treat acute and painful muscle spasm and spasticity in adults and elderly individuals. In contrast with other centrally acting SMRs, tolperisone use does not appear to be associated with somnolence or cognitive impairment.

An ultra-pure formulation of tolperisone has been developed for use in the United States using a synthetic pathway that has reduced the impurity and degradant levels below International Council for Harmonisation guidelines. Based on prior clinical studies in the United States and clinical experience in Europe and Asia, doses of tolperisone 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg three times daily (TID) were selected to be evaluated versus placebo for the treatment of acute muscle spasm in this phase 2 dose-ranging study.

### Treatment algorithms for continuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the management of musculoskeletal pain: an Italian position paper [^1e120b31]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain (MSP), which impacts bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments, is a substantial worldwide pain disorder, characterized by muscle soreness, fatigue, inflammation, muscle spasms, sleep disruptions, and functional limitations. MSP is predominantly managed within the primary care setting. Recent consensus recognizes that heat therapy (HT) may provide potential benefits, especially in treating chronic MSP. To develop shared algorithms for the treatment of MSP through local superficial HT (SHT) using continuous low-level heat wrap therapy, a four-member board of experts was designated. Three anatomical sites have been deemed of particular interest regarding potential response to exogenous SHT. Neck and shoulder pain are commonly attributed to traumatic experiences, muscle spasms, postural defects, or poor posture as common potential causes. HT may be helpful for painful contractures, although treatment should be limited in duration to prevent instability. Low back pain, the leading cause of disability, may have either specific or non-specific etiology. SHT, physical therapy, instrumental therapy, manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, motor activity, and trunk orthoses are all potential treatment options. SHT should be considered in chronic degenerative disc disease, non-specific LBP with muscle spasm or contracture, postural and overuse myalgia, and osteoarthritis (OA), excluding the inflammatory phase. Assessment of knee pain includes both a review of the patient's medical history and a careful physical examination. SHT of the knee should be considered in case of muscle spasms, overuse pathology, early OA, and indirect muscle lesions. Patients who receive SHT may experience a reduction in pain, restoration of muscle strength, loosening of stiffness, and an overall improvement in their quality of life. This expert opinion proposes shared algorithms for MSP treatment via local SHT with the aiming to provide practical guidance on its proper application, highlighting specific potentialities as well as contraindications.

### Non-drug therapies for the secondary prevention of lower limb muscle cramps [^723eb7e1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower limb muscle cramps are common and painful. They can limit exercise participation, and reduce quality of sleep, and quality of life. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps; some are controversial or could cause harm, and often, people experience no benefit from the interventions used. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. We updated the review to incorporate new evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive therapies for lower limb muscle cramps.

Search Methods

In August 2018 and May 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of included studies. We imposed no restrictions by language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-drug, non-invasive interventions tested over at least four weeks, for lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people, except pregnant women. The primary outcome was cramp frequency. Secondary outcomes were cramp pain severity, cramp duration, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living, proportion of participants reporting lower limb muscle cramps, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and cross-checked data extraction and analyses according to standard Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included three trials, with 201 participants, all 50 years of age and older; none had neurological disease. All trials evaluated a form of stretching for lower limb muscle cramps. A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps (measured on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 10 cm = worst pain imaginable) in people aged 55 years and older, compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) -1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.74 to -0.86; 1 RCT, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was very low for cramp frequency (change in number of cramps per night from week zero to week six) comparing the stretching group and the no intervention group (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.6; 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Calf stretching alone for 12 weeks may make little to no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older (stretching group median number of cramps in the last four weeks (Md) 4, interquartile range (IQR) 8; N = 48; sham stretching group Md 3, IQR 7.63; N = 46) (U = 973.5, z = -0.995, P = 0.32, r = 0.10; 1 RCT, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence). This trial did not report cramp severity. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome (N = 24). It was not possible to fully analyse the frequency data and the scale used to measure cramp severity is not validated. No study reported health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, or participation in activities of daily living. No participant in these three studies reported adverse events. The evidence for adverse events was of moderate certainty as the studies were too small to detect uncommon events. In two of the three studies, outcomes were at risk of recall bias, and tools used to measure outcomes were not validated. Due to limitations in study designs that led to risks of bias, and imprecise findings with wide CIs, we cannot be certain that findings of future studies will be similar to those presented in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 55 years and older, but the effect on cramp frequency is uncertain. Calf stretching alone compared to sham stretching for 12 weeks may make little or no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome. Overall, use of unvalidated outcome measures and inconsistent diagnostic criteria make it difficult to compare the studies and apply findings to clinical practice. Given the prevalence and impact of lower limb muscle cramps, there is a pressing need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well-designed RCTs across all types of lower limb muscle cramps. A specific cramp outcome tool should be developed and validated for use in future research.

### Nonsurgical approaches for the treatment of anal fissures [^89018a20]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic anal fissure (CAF) is usually associated with internal anal sphincter spasm, the relief of which is central to provide fissure healing. The treatment for CAF has undergone a transformation in recent years from surgical to medical. Both the approaches share the common goal of reducing the spasm. Though surgical treatment has a high success rate, it can permanently impair fecal continence in a large number of patients. Smooth muscle relaxation seems to be a novel way by which more than 60% of the patients can be cured with the topical use of the agents. This treatment is in addition to the normalization of stools mostly. Smooth muscle relaxation is well tolerated, can be administered on an outpatient basis, does not cause any lesion of the continence organ, and subsequently, does not lead to any permanent latent or apparent fecal incontinence. This review encompasses various agents that are used for smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, it describes various clinical studies reported in the literature with their success rates and side effects.

### The role of therapy in spasticity management [^336dbf73]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A number of different therapy interventions and modalities have been utilized in spasticity management. There is significant variation in the use of these therapies, which is often due to experience that the treating clinicians have with one type or another. Given the lack of well controlled studies, it is difficult to take an evidence-based approach regarding the use of these interventions at this time. This article examines the physiologic basis for the more common therapy interventions in the management of spasticity and discusses some of the literature that may help guide the clinician in choosing among these options.

### Neurogenic muscle cramps [^8e36d2b9]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are sustained, painful contractions of muscle and are prevalent in patients with and without medical conditions. The objective of this review is to present updates on the mechanism, investigation and treatment of neurogenic muscle cramps. PubMed and Embase databases were queried between January 1980 and July 2014 for English-language human studies. The American Academy of Neurology classification of studies (classes I-IV) was used to assess levels of evidence. Mechanical disruption, ephaptic transmission, disruption of sensory afferents and persistent inward currents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurogenic cramps. Investigations are directed toward identifying physiological triggers or medical conditions predisposing to cramps. Although cramps can be self-limiting, disabling or sustained muscle cramps should prompt investigation for underlying medical conditions. Lifestyle modifications, treatment of underlying conditions, stretching, B-complex vitamins, diltiezam, mexiletine, carbamazepine, tetrahydrocannabinoid, leveteracitam and quinine sulfate have shown evidence for treatment.

### Rare phenomena of central rhythm and pattern generation in a case of complete spinal cord injury [^c3626d9b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here, the intriguing similarity of the multi-muscle activation patterns of the myoclonus bursts with those of muscle spasms led us to propose an alternative explanation. The electromyographic patterns of muscle spasms always spanned multiple lower-limb muscles. The sensory-evoked spinal myoclonus always evolved from spasms and never recruited additional muscles. The spinal myoclonus bursts resembled the electromyographic activity of spasms, although the latter generally appeared with a longer duration (cf. Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). Statistically, the multi-muscle electromyographic patterns did not differ between myoclonus bursts and muscle spasms. A close link between these motor phenomena can be also deduced from previous studies. High levels of spasticity were a common factor across the individuals who had developed the Bussel-Calancie type of spinal myoclonus. It was also previously noticed that spinal myoclonus could evolve from strong muscle spasms induced by hip extension when the study participants moved from sitting to lying position. Muscle spasms are one of the manifestations of spasticity in chronic SCI. They are involuntary, prolonged muscle contractions that can outlast the sensory inputs that had triggered them by many seconds, but do not have a recurring, rhythmic behavior, (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 13). Spasms following a SCI have traditionally been attributed to decreased inhibition of sensory transmission and increased expression of plateau potentials in motoneurons. However, a contribution of spinal interneuronal circuits has long been hypothesized, in part because stretch at one joint induces stereotyped spasms in multiple non-stretched muscles, (Supplementary Fig. 4b). An enhancement in excitability of interneurons within the multi-segmental, spasm-generating circuits is likely involved. Some studies have suggested that the neural substrate of muscle spasms may overlap with spinal pattern-formation circuits, because of their mixed-synergy co-activation patterns and the interaction with proprioceptive inputs, specifically the entrainment of muscle spasms by imposed oscillatory hip movements. A study in a mouse model of chronic SCI suggested that muscle spasms are generated by persistent activity in excitatory interneuron populations, while a delayed activity in inhibitory neural circuits curtails the muscle spasms. Another study in mice identified a specific class of locomotor-related excitatory interneurons, which receive extensive direct sensory afferent input and have commissural and propriospinal connections, as candidates for first-order interneurons in sensory-evoked spasms. These V3 interneurons are associated with pattern formation, but do not intrinsically oscillate or initiate locomotion by themselves. We propose that spinal myoclonus taps into the pattern-formation circuits of muscle spasms. The candidate circuits likely involve first-order interneurons that had become highly excitable under the specific pathophysiological conditions, resulting in quasi 'hard-wired' downstream excitatory actions across the midline and upon other spinal cord segments, as suggested by the consistent multi-muscle activation across the different spinal myoclonus examples (see also Fig. 2 in Calancie). These pathways further receive extensive proprioceptive input from the hip, knee, and ankle as well as cutaneous input from the foot. The major distinction of spinal myoclonus from muscle spasms would then be its rhythmic nature.

### Stiff-person syndrome and GAD antibody-spectrum disorders: GABAergic neuronal excitability, immunopathogenesis and update on antibody therapies [^685a255b]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS)

Although said to affect approximately 1 in a million people, the precise frequency and estimated SPS prevalence are unclear, especially when viewed within the GAD spectrum disorders. As judged by the large number of patients referred to us and personally examined and followed the last 30 years, we believe SPS is more common than previously thought but still under-recognized. It is twice as common in women than men above the age of 20 years. Patients typically present with muscle spasms and stiffness, concurrently in the thoracolumbar paraspinal and abdominal muscles, resulting in difficulty turning and bending (Fig. 1). When stiffness is severe, the patients' walking resembles a "statue" or exhibits a "freezing-like" appearance; some patients mention that they walk like a "tin-man" with hyperlordotic posture. Spasms are frequent in the trunk or any extremity and can be painful. Spasms can be also seen in the face and if limited exclusively to the facial muscles, as we have seen in rare patients with very high GAD-antibody titers, we have referred it as "stiff-face syndrome". Muscle spasms and stiffness can be precipitated by unexpected stimuli, including sounds, like a phone ring or a siren, sudden touches or conditions triggering anxiety and emotional upset which, when severe, are misdiagnosed as a primary anxiety disorder. The episodic nature of spasms, often emphasized by the patients, is important to acknowledge because at times it may not be obvious when a patient is first examined but may become apparent even 30 min later as the patient becomes more anxious even while waiting in the examining room. Task-specific phobias, especially fear of walking, crossing a street or a green light and fear of falling, are quite common. In some cases, these or similar events can cause severe and continuous painful spasms, along with stiffness in the thoracic muscles with breathing difficulties, tachycardia and hyperhidrosis, a condition we have labeled "status spasticus", requiring emergency admission for intravenous diazepam. Electrophysiological studies reveal continuous activity of motor unit firing at rest, confirming that stiffness is caused by co-contractions of agonists and antagonists muscles.

### Impact of therapeutic hypothermia on infantile spasms: an observational cohort study [^ffce1832]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infantile spasms were first reported by Dr West in 1841. 1 Historically, infantile spasms and West syndrome have often been used synonymously. Current established terminology describes West syndrome as a subset of infantile spasms, consisting of the combination of spasms and a hypsarrhythmic electroencephalogram (EEG) (Fig. S1, online supporting information). Often, but not necessarily, they are accompanied by developmental delay and/or regression. 2, 3, 4 Infantile spasms are described as an age‐specific epileptic encephalopathy, with a clinically distinguished seizure type, which may or may not be accompanied by the characteristic EEG findings of hypsarrhythmia. 5 Infantile spasms have an estimated incidence of 2 to 5 per 10 000 live births. 6 Spasms typically present as clusters of sudden brief flexion, extension, or mixed extension–flexion contractions of proximal and truncal muscles, followed by a sustained tonic phase lasting up to 2 seconds. 3, 7, 8 These often resolve over time, but up to 50% of patients develop other types of refractory epilepsy syndromes, such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. 9

Infantile spasms are further categorized into two subgroups: infantile spasms with a known and clearly identifiable cause (formerly known as symptomatic), including metabolic, structural, and genetic causes; and infantile spasms of unknown cause. 10, 11 A better prognosis is reported in the majority of patients in the latter subgroup. 5, 12 Hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) forms the major aetiology of infantile spasms, 13 but limited research that evaluates the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the incidence and outcome of infantile spasms has been published. 14

Early diagnosis and treatment of infantile spasms are believed to improve outcome, especially if started within the first month of the onset of spasms. 12 The aims of treatment are to obtain spasm cessation, normalize the EEG, and achieve better long‐term developmental outcomes. Treatment options consist of standard first‐line pharmacological agents, including hormonal therapy and vigabatrin, and non‐standard options including other medications, a ketogenic diet, and surgical intervention. 3 Because of the rarity of the disorder, experimental trials are difficult to perform and are therefore limited.

### Leg cramps [^3d12d077]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Involuntary, localised leg cramps are common and typically affect the calf muscles at night.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for idiopathic leg cramps? What are the effects of treatments for leg cramps in pregnancy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, anti-epileptic drugs, calcium salts, compression hosiery, magnesium salts, multivitamin and mineral supplements, quinine alone or with theophylline, sodium chloride, and stretching exercises.

### Symptomatic and restorative therapies in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^eda7ab4b]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Spasticity and other muscle tone abnormalities

Spasticity is an abnormal increase in muscle tone secondary to lesions affecting the descending corticospinal and parapyramidal tracts. It has a constant "tonic" component and an episodic "phasic" component. The tonic component leads to limb stiffness and hypokinesia while the phasic component results in tonic spasms and several other hyperkinetic movements. As mentioned previously, inflammation and demyelination of the pyramidal tracts in the spinal cord in NMOSD patients can result in tonic spasms and other involuntary movements (phasic spasticity) even before the development of the constant tonic phase. In this section, we will focus primarily on tonic spasticity.

There are no definitive estimates of spasticity in NMOSD but evaluation of 522 self-identified NMOSD patients from the "Patients-Like-Me" online community suggested a prevalence rate of 52%. This is higher than the 37% estimated rate in some MS studies, which is likely reflective of the higher frequency of motor spinal attacks in NMOSD compared to the sensory-predominant attacks in MS. Spasticity can impair residual function, cause pain, limit the range of motion, and predispose to skin breakdown and infections. We were not able to identify any dedicated studies of tonic spasticity management in NMOSD. Based on MS studies and clinical experience, three major approaches are commonly utilized. The first approach is the use of oral anti-spasticity agents including the GABA-B agonist baclofen and/or the α2 agonist tizanidine. Both were studied in randomized controlled trials and are effective against tonic spasticity in MS but can cause excessive sedation and occasionally interfere with motor function. Patients who rely on their spasticity to compensate for lower extremity weakness can experience gait worsening with these muscle relaxants. Other less commonly used oral agents for spasticity include the peripherally acting dantrolene and cannabinoid receptor agonists. The latter group has shown modest but controversial evidence in randomized controlled trials of MS-related spasticity and their general use in NMOSD is not evidence based. The use of benzodiazepines (GABA-A modulators) for NMOSD-related spasticity is also controversial because of the implication of GABA-A enhancement in the overexpression of AQP4 water channels on the surface of astrocytes potentially increasing the risk of relapse.

### Medical marijuana for the treatment of vismodegib-related muscle spasm [^def32eca]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) arises from loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor patched homologue 1, which normally inhibits smoothened homologue in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Vismodegib, a smoothened homologue inhibitor, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for metastatic or locally advanced BCC that has recurred after surgery or for patients who are not candidates for surgery and radiation. Common adverse effects of vismodegib are muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, nausea, and weight loss. Muscle spasms worsen with duration of drug administration and may lead to drug discontinuation. We report a case of vismodegib-related muscle spasm that was successfully treated with medical marijuana (MM).

In a pooled analysis of 3 clinical trials, nabilone and nabiximols modestly improved muscle spasticity compared with placebo, as reported by MS patients; an average improvement of 0.76 on a 0-to-10 numerical rating scale was observed. Clinician-measured spasticity using the Ashworth scale, which grades muscle tone in response to passive motion, trended toward improvement in a pooled analysis of 5 trials investigating the benefit of nabiximols, dronabinol, and THC/CBDin MS patients. Overall, by meta-analysis, moderate-quality data support the use of cannabinoids for spasticity and chronic pain in MS patients. For muscle spasm from spinal cord injury, the limited evidence available suggests benefit from cannabinoids. In one pilot study, use of nabilone resulted in significant improvement by Ashworth scale and a trend toward improvement on other spasticity scales. Persistent spasms are an approved prescribing indication for MM in California. In a study of 1,746 patients from 9 California clinics, pain and muscle spasm were the most common reasons for prescribing.

The mechanism of cannabinoid-associated antispasmodic activity is not well understood. Activity at CB1 and CB2 receptors, located in high concentrations at the cerebellum and substantia nigra, may play a role. Other hypotheses include decreased perception of muscle spasm, euphoria, and placebo effect. Nabiximols, dronabinol, nabilone, THC, and ECP002A are cannabinoid subtypes that have been investigated for relief of muscle spasticity; any difference in efficacy based on cannabinoid subtype is not established.

Muscle spasm is a frequent side effect of vismodegib. In one phase II study, 68% of patients on vismodegib experienced muscle spasms; 48% were grade 1, 16% grade 2, and 4% were grade 3 or 4 in severity. Similar frequencies are seen in other studies. There is no standard treatment for this side effect. Antispasmodics such as cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, and quinine are commonly tried. Calcium channel blockade with amlodipine has some efficacy, and a clinical trial evaluating the effect of levocarnitine is ongoing (NCT01893892). Use of cannabinoids has not been reported.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^28180920]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R consensus guidance — assessment and management key findings emphasize holistic, patient-centered evaluation and multimodal care. Assessment should include the impact on function and quality of life, and spasticity interventions should often be used in combination for maximal benefit with coordinated care among physiatrists, therapists, caregivers, and surgeons when appropriate. Evidence gaps limit strong recommendations: nonpharmacologic interventions are integral to PM&R practice but are not studied for effectiveness in rigorous clinical trials, and studies are commonly not randomized with small, heterogeneous samples. The panel notes both gains and the need for more targeted, mechanism-based treatments across conditions, and identifies access to care as an obstacle influenced by socioeconomic factors that require attention at individual and societal levels.

### Non-drug therapies for lower limb muscle cramps [^bb320546]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About one in every three adults are affected by lower limb muscle cramps. For some people, these cramps reduce quality of life, quality of sleep and participation in activities of daily living. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps, but some are controversial, no treatment guidelines exist, and often people experience no benefit from the interventions prescribed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive treatments for lower limb cramp.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (13 September 2011) using the terms: cramp, spasm, contracture, charley horse and lower limb, lower extremity, foot, calf, leg, thigh, gastrocnemius, hamstring, quadriceps. We also searched CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2011) and the reference lists of included studies. There were no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of non-drug, non-invasive interventions trialled over at least four weeks for the prevention of lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people. We excluded, for example, surgery, acupuncture and dry-needling, as invasive interventions. We selected only trials that included at least one of the following outcomes: cramp frequency, cramp severity, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living and adverse outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and cross checked data extraction and analysis. A third author was to arbitrate in the event of disagreement. We asked the authors of five trials for information to assist with screening studies for eligibility and received four responses.

Main Results

One trial was eligible for inclusion. All participants were age 60 years or over and had received a repeat prescription from their general practitioner of quinine for nighttime cramps in the preceding three months. This review includes data from only those participants who were advised to continue taking quinine. Forty-nine participants were advised to complete lean-to-wall calf muscle stretching held for 10 s three times per day. Forty-eight participants were allocated to a placebo stretching group. After 12 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in recalled cramp frequency between groups. No "significant" adverse effect was reported. Limitations in the study's design impede interpretation of the results and clinical applicability.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the use of non-drug therapies for the treatment of lower limb muscle cramp. Serious methodological limitations in the existing evidence hinder clinical application. There is an urgent need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well designed randomised controlled trials.

### Urogenital complaints and female sexual dysfunction (part 1) [^1690e7ab]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual dysfunction and dyspareunia are common complaints in women with urological disorders.

Aim

To provide a comprehensive review of sexual dysfunction related to common hypersensitive/hyperactive urogenital disorders including interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS), overactive bladder (OAB) with and without incontinence, and high-tone pelvic floor muscle dysfunction and the appropriate treatment strategies.

Methods

A medical literature search using several related terms including sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia, IC/PBS, OAB, urinary incontinence pelvic floor dysfunction, and levator ani muscle spasm.

Main Outcome Measures

Review of the medical literature to identify relation between sexual dysfunction and common urological disorders in women and to describe appropriate treatment strategies to improve the women's quality of life.

Results

A thorough review of sexual dysfunction in urological disorders and their related treatments modalities including: behavioral, pharmacological, and nonpharmacological therapies.

Conclusions

Sexual dysfunction is a common, underestimated, and untreated complaint in women with urologic disorders. Identifying sexual complaints and treating the underlying etiologies can result in significant improvement in a woman's quality of life. This process requires a focused, multidisciplinary approach tailored to meet the needs of women with urogenital complaints.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^29caf2e7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review identified 44 studies examining the effectiveness or efficacy of long-term use of SMRs to treat chronic painful conditions, a clinical practice that has expanded considerably in recent decades. Long-term use of SMRs for chronic pain may be beneficial for patients with painful spasms or cramps and neck pain; evidence was equivocal for their long-term use for low back pain, fibromyalgia, and headaches. Clinicians should be vigilant for adverse effects and consider deprescribing if pain-related goals are not met.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^48cd4327]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review identified 44 studies that investigated the long-term use of SMRs, including 9 specific medications, for a range of chronic pain conditions. Evidence for effectiveness was strongest for SMRs used for muscle spasms, painful cramps, and neck pain; in studies of SMRs for fibromyalgia, low back pain, headaches, and other syndromes, some showed small benefits and some did not, and on balance studies did not suggest a benefit. The most common adverse effects were sedation (and other central nervous system–related effects, including dizziness) and dry mouth. No studies measured the misuse of SMRs. Most studies lasted only a month or slightly longer, and this short duration may bias toward higher efficacy (many pharmacologic treatments for pain show declining efficacy over time) and toward lower adverse effects (which may develop over time, including misuse of SMRs).

This summary of the evidence raises concerns given the growth in SMR prescriptions over the last decade, including for more than 1 in 6 patients seeking care for chronic back pain in a national study of Medicare beneficiaries. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that as many as 30% of individuals using opioids are also prescribed SMRs, which increase risks of opioid-related overdose, particularly in those taking SMRs for longer durations. Therefore, despite increasing prevalence and increasing risks of their use, our systematic review suggests only limited evidence of efficacy for long-term use of SMRs for a small subset of pain syndromes.

This review broadens the work of prior reviews that have focused on individual medications and specific pain syndromes. Two recent systematic reviews, examining the effectiveness and safety of multiple medication classes in the management of acute and chronic nonspecific lower back pain found no evidence of difference between SMRs and placebo in the management of chronic nonspecific low-back pain. Another reviewfocused on the efficacy and safety of cyclobenzaprine for myofascial pain and found insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclobenzaprine. While nonspecific back pain tends to be the most common reason for SMR prescriptions in the United States, approximately one-third of office visits during which SMRs were prescribed addressed non–back pain syndromes, suggesting that in practice SMRs are used for a variety of indications for which evidence is limited.

### Diazepam as an adjuvant analgesic to morphine for pain due to skeletal muscle spasm [^28e1863a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Side effects of morphine are common when it is given in titrated doses to control severe pain in advanced cancer. We describe a case of severe back pain resistant to parenteral morphine accompanied by muscle spasm, in which the addition of diazepam both had an opioid-sparing effect and provided superior symptomatic relief. Diazepam appears to have a specific role as an adjuvant analgesic for pain due to skeletal muscle spasm associated with painful vertebral metastases.

### Acute myocardial infarction: etiologies and mimickers in young patients [^7bf30170]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonatheromatous

Coronary Vasospasm

Coronary vasospasm is a rare but important cause of AMI in young patients and a subcategory of myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries. This syndrome refers to a transient process characterized by sudden onset chest pain secondary to epicardial coronary artery spasm which usually leads to transient myocardial ischemia, with chest pain and ECG changes. Persistent and refractory vasospasm is what ultimately leads to myocardial necrosis and AMI. Although the prevalence of coronary spasm is unknown, it predominantly affects younger patients with similar incidence in men and women. The pathophysiology of coronary vasospasm is multifactorial and is hypothesized to be secondary to autonomic overstimulation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and smooth muscle hypercontractility. Clues to consider vasospastic angina include a prior history of repetitive nonexertional chest pain, ST‐elevation in contiguous leads on the presenting ECG, and nonobstructive coronary arteries on angiography. A detailed history of recreational and prescribed drugs that might induce coronary vasospasm may provide additional evidence to support this diagnosis. The definitive assessment for coronary artery vasospasm involves coronary angiography with provocative testing using ergonovine (acts on serotonergic receptors on smooth muscle) or acetylcholine (acts on muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle and the endothelium). A positive provocation test is defined as coronary luminal narrowing of 50%, 70%, 75%, or 90% with accompanying symptoms and ECG changes. The single most important evidence‐based therapy for improving prognosis in vasospasm is smoking cessation, if applicable. After this, the primary strategy includes avoidance of vasospasm‐precipitating medications and medical therapy with calcium channel blockers and nitrates. Despite adequate treatment, vasospasm may recur in up to 4% to 19% of patients. The overall clinical prognosis is generally favorable if patients are treated with appropriate medical therapies and modifiable risk factors (ie, medications and recreational substance use) are properly addressed.

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant [^fb221442]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are widely used in treating musculoskeletal conditions. However, evidence of their effectiveness consists mainly of studies with poor methodologic design. In addition, these drugs have not been proven to be superior to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses support using skeletal muscle relaxants for short-term relief of acute low back pain when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen are not effective or tolerated. Comparison studies have not shown one skeletal muscle relaxant to be superior to another. Cyclobenzaprine is the most heavily studied and has been shown to be effective for various musculoskeletal conditions. The sedative properties of tizanidine and cyclobenzaprine may benefit patients with insomnia caused by severe muscle spasms. Methocarbamol and metaxalone are less sedating, although effectiveness evidence is limited. Adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness, are consistently reported with all skeletal muscle relaxants. The potential adverse effects should be communicated clearly to the patient. Because of limited comparable effectiveness data, choice of agent should be based on side-effect profile, patient preference, abuse potential, and possible drug interactions.

### Efficacy and safety of cannabinoid oromucosal spray for multiple sclerosis spasticity [^18177b42]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Spasticity, defined as abnormally increased muscular tone, is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.MS spasticity causes or worsens different MS symptoms, usually having a big impact on patients' quality of life. The most frequent symptoms associated with spasticity in patients with MS, beyond mobility worsening, are spasms, pain, poor sleep quality (linked to pain and nocturnal spasms) and urinary dysfunction. Classically recommended medications for generalised spasticity, including baclofen, tizanidine, dantrolene, benzodiazepines and clonazepam, have shown limited clinical benefit in systematic reviews. The approval of 9-δ-tetrahydocannabinol and cannabidiol (THC:CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex), in a number of European countries, including Italy, provides a new opportunity as an add-on medication for the management of moderate to severe generalised spasticity and related symptoms in patients with MS resistant to common oral antispastic drugs. Sativex is an endocannabinoid system modulator containing THC and CBD in a near 1:1 ratio. THC interacts with cannabinoid human receptors that play a key role in the modulation of muscle tone, whereas CBD at higher than natural concentrations may limit the psychoactive effects of THC. The efficacy of Sativex oromucosal spray as an add-on therapy for symptoms improvement in patients with MS with moderate to severe MS spasticity has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. The largest pivotal phase III, enriched-design clinical trial included patients with MS with moderate–severe spasticity corresponding to a patient-reported numerical rating scale (NRS) score ≥ 4.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^9f8427f5]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity assessment — initial and follow-up guidance emphasizes consistent measurement, symptom domains, and comprehensive evaluation to guide management. We recommend consistency in measurement tools beginning with the initial assessment and continuing through ongoing management. As a component of upper motor neuron syndrome, spasticity includes positive and negative signs/symptoms; the positive signs/symptoms include excessive muscle tone, hyperactive stretch reflexes, clonus, and spasms, and the negative signs/symptoms include incoordination, fatigue, weakness, and impaired motor control. A comprehensive evaluation of a patient with spasticity should include a patient-centered history and physical examination that incorporates upper and lower limb functional ability, passive range of motion, and active range of motion with repetition of movement. The purpose of the assessment is to set collaborative patient-centered goals for treatment and to evaluate the treatment response in a consistent and repeatable manner, and realistic treatment goal setting for patients (as well as family members and caregivers) is critical because it promotes motivation and cooperation as well as proper management of expectations and can favorably affect outcome. The use of goal attainment scales has been shown to help organize, focus, and clarify the aims of treatment to optimize the clinical response. Quantitative methods such as motion capture using marker-based or markerless technology can now be integrated into clinical practice for reliable and repeated measurements, and electrophysiologic and biomechanical assessments can be used as adjuncts to clinical measures to quantify the associated abnormal muscle activity. Table 3 provides an overview of commonly used tools to assess passive and active range of motion, repetitive motion, and upper and lower limb function for treatment planning and periodic reassessment before and after interventions to treat spasticity.

### Sonidegib-induced muscle spasms in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma: strategies to adopt [^f06c44fb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1

We read with great interest the article written by Trabelsi et al.regarding the management of sonidegib treatment in multiple basal cell carcinomas during COVID‐19 pandemic period and we also want to report our experience. Sonidegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HPI) approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC). From 95% to 100% of patients treated with hedgehog pathway inhibitors, experience at least one treatment‐related adverse event (AE) with "muscle spasms" being AE most frequently observed. In the 42‐month analysis of the phase II, randomized BOLT study muscle spasms were reported in 54% of patients treated with 200 mg sonidegib (for a median duration of 11 months), leading to treatment discontinuation in 5% of cases. Adequate hydration, physical activity, and several pharmacological treatments have been recommended in order to better manage muscle spasms; moreover creatine‐kinase levels have to be tested every month in patients undergoing sonidegib treatment. Aim of this single‐center analysis was to retrospectively review and assess the occurrence of muscle spasms and describe their management in all patients with laBCC treated with 200 mg sonidegib (from February 2020 to August 2021) during COVID‐19 pandemic period. 62 patients (44 males and 18 females) with a median age of 75.8 years were included in the study. The median duration of treatment with sonidegib was 7.6 months. 49 out of 62 (79%) patients experienced muscle spasms with 43 patients (88%) with grade I–II of severity and 6 patients (12%) with grade III of severity, according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The majority of AEs reported were mild or moderate, occurring early in the course of treatment. Reported rate of discontinuation because of all AEs during the year following the initiation was 39% (24/62 patients), in particular, 4 of them (16.6%) for muscle spasms, 14 patients (54.1%) stopped treatment for multiple AEs and 6 patients (29.3%) discontinued treatment following "their own judgment". Muscle spasms appeared, on average, 1.8 months after treatment initiation affecting lower limbs and foot (73%) and upper limbs (67%); they usually occurred at night (83%), at rest (53%), affecting patients' daily activities. 64% among patients affected presented muscle spasms every day, whereas, 36% several times during a week. Several strategies were adopted during treatment in order to correct manage the AE, improving patients' quality of life. 21 out of 49 patients (43%) presenting muscle spasms were prescribed magnesium supplementation, 16 patients (33%) received the alternate dosing regimen (200 mg sonidegib every other day) and 12 patients were prescribed gabapentin (100 or 200 mg daily according to the grade of severity). The majority of patients referred general improvement with 78% having a grade decrease from III to II or II to I (Table 1). Adopting correct strategies to manage muscle spasms resulted reducing the toxicity, thus preventing treatment discontinuation in elderly patients, also considering the possible rate of treatment discontinuation during the pandemic period. In literature there are no many data regarding real‐life experiences on the AEs related to HPI treatment; our retrospective study showed that although muscle spasms represent a common AE arising in patients undergoing hedgehog pathway inhibitors, they usually occur in a mild–moderate grade; the reduction of dosing regimen and/or the supplementation with non‐pharmacological and pharmacological therapies could be useful strategies to prevent drug‐induced toxicity. Further studies are still required.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^5fd06a7b]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Among the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-antibody–spectrum disorders, the most common phenotypic subset is the stiff-person syndrome (SPS), caused by impaired GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission and autoimmunity characterized by very high titers of GAD antibodies and increased GAD-IgG intrathecal synthesis. If not properly treated or untreated because of delayed diagnosis, SPS progresses leading to disability; it is therefore fundamental to apply the best therapeutic schemes from the outset. This article is focused on the rationale of specific therapeutic strategies based on the SPS pathophysiology targeting both the impaired reciprocal GABAergic inhibition to symptomatically improve the main clinical manifestations of stiffness in the truncal and proximal limb muscles, gait dysfunction, and episodic painful muscle spasms and the autoimmunity to enhance improvement and slow down disease progression. A practical, step-by-step therapeutic approach is provided, highlighting the importance of combination therapies with the preferred gamma-aminobutyric acid–enhancing antispasmodic drugs, such as baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin, that provide the first-line symptomatic therapy, while detailing the application of current immunotherapies with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) plasmapheresis, and rituximab. The pitfalls and concerns of long-term therapies in different age groups, including children, women planning pregnancy, and especially the elderly considering their comorbidities are emphasized, also highlighting the challenges in distinguishing the conditioning effects or expectations of chronically applied therapies from objective meaningful clinical benefits. Finally, the need for future targeted immunotherapeutic options based on disease immunopathogenesis and the biologic basis of autoimmune hyperexcitability are discussed, pointing out the unique challenges in the design of future controlled clinical trials especially in quantifying the extend and severity of stiffness, episodic or startle-triggered muscle spasms, task-specific phobias, and excitability.

### Efficacy of a low-dose regimen of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in acute skeletal muscle spasm: results of two placebo-controlled trials [^dd423176]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is a muscle relaxant that is effective in improving muscle spasm, reducing local pain and tenderness, and increasing range of motion in acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Sedation is the most common adverse event associated with its use at the usual dosage of 10 mg TID. Studies in healthy adults suggest that a lower dose may produce less sedation. Because cyclobenzaprine's duration of action is 4 to 6 hours, reducing the dosing frequency to 10 mg BID would create a potentially painful untreated interval between doses. The alternative is administration of a lower dose (eg, 5 or 2.5 mg) TID.

Objective

These studies were designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of cyclobenzaprine 2.5, 5, and 10 mg TID compared with placebo in patients with acute musculoskeletal spasm.

Methods

In 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials conducted at primary care centers in the United States, adult patients with acute painful muscle spasm of the lumbar or cervical region were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg cyclobenzaprine TID or placebo for 7 days (study 1: cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg TID or placebo; study 2: cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg TID or placebo). The primary efficacy measures were patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache. Neither study included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as an active control. Although physicians frequently prescribe an analgesic or NSAID in addition to cyclobenzaprine, these studies were not designed to assess whether adding cyclobenzaprine provides a benefit over that of an analgesic.

Results

One thousand four hundred five patients (737 study 1; 668 study 2), two thirds with low back pain and one third with neck pain, were randomized to treatment. Their mean age was 42 years, and approximately 89% were white. In both studies, patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg had significantly higher mean scores on the primary efficacy measures compared with those receiving placebo (study 1-P ≤ 0.001 cyclobenzaprine 5 and 10 mg vs placebo, all measures at visits 2 and 3; study 2-P ≤ 0.03 cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg vs placebo, relief from starting backache on day 3 only; cyclobenzaprine 5 mg vs placebo, patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache at visit 3 or day 7 only). On day 7, significantly more patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg reported relief compared with placebo recipients (P < 0.05 all cyclobenzaprine groups vs placebo). Onset of relief was apparent within 3 or 4 doses of the 5-mg regimen. In the subanalysis of the proportion of responders in the pooled 5-mg groups who did and did not report somnolence, a meaningful treatment effect was observed on all primary efficacy variables in patients who did not report somnolence, suggesting that efficacy was independent of sedation. Cyclobenzaprine was well tolerated. Somnolence and dry mouth, the most common adverse effects, were mild and dose related. Overall, ≥ 1 adverse event was reported in 54.1%, 61.8%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 1 and by 43.9%, 55.9%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 2. Adverse events were the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment in the cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg groups in both studies. In study 2, ineffectiveness of therapy was the main reason for discontinuation of therapy in the group receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg.

Conclusions

Cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg TID was not significantly more effective than placebo. The cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg TID regimens were associated with significantly higher mean efficacy scores compared with placebo. Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg TID was as effective as 10 mg TID, and was associated with a lower incidence of sedation.

Skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) are commonly prescribed medications indicated for relief of muscle spasms associated with acute and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Muscle tone is often accompanied by pain symptoms, so it is crucial to integrate analgesics with SMR adjunctive therapy. Such combination use could significantly improve the effectiveness of treating spasticity and allows to reduce doses of each agent in the multimodal analgesia regimen.

SMRs can be classified into two main categories: (1) antispasticity agents that work on the spinal cord or directly on the skeletal muscles to improve muscle hypertonicity and involuntary spasms (eg, baclofen, dantrolene), and (2) antispasmodic agents that decrease muscle spasms through alterations of central nervous system (CNS) conduction (eg, carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and chlorzoxazone). The overlap between these two categories includes tizanidine and diazepam, as they have both antispastic and antispasmodic activity.

An understanding of the pharmacology and therapeutics as well as the patient complexity helps to select an appropriate SMR for the patient. Clinicians should weigh the pros and cons of prescribing SMRs while tailoring treatments to each patient's individual needs.

Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with sedative, hypnotic, antianxiety, and antiepileptic properties in addition to its muscle relaxant effects, and it is also a controlled substance. In addition, diazepam should be avoided in the elderly due to increased sensitivity of older adults to benzodiazepines and prominently weakened drug metabolism. Therefore, the use of diazepam as an SMR is limited in clinical practice, especially for older adults.

It is worth noting that all SMRs, with the exception of baclofen and tizanidine, are on the list of 2023 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria ® for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults. Additionally, baclofen was newly added with a recommendation to avoid its use in older adults with impaired kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min], given the increased risk for encephalopathy in this population. So tizanidine is one of the few SMRs that seem to be friendly to older adults.

### Facial aberrant reinnervation syndrome following facial nerve injury and recovery [^4491140c]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A common sequela of peripheral nerve injury is aberrant regeneration and recovery. Aberrant regeneration of injured motor nerves can affect all aspects of the nerve circuit from the motor cortex to the target muscle. A more comprehensive term for the symptoms that develop after aberrant motor neuromuscular reinnervation is aberrant reinnervation syndrome (ARS). Injury to the facial nerve followed by aberrant reinnervation results in a spectrum of symptoms that has been called many things in the literature. The authors support that this commonly encountered sequela of facial nerve injury be called facial aberrant reinnervation syndrome (FARS), a term that is more descriptive of the underlying pathophysiology and more inclusive of the clinical symptoms: facial synkinesis, facial muscle hypertonicity, and facial muscle spasm/twitching, which occur following facial nerve injury and recovery. In the following article, we present the clinical manifestations and sequelae of facial nerve injury and recovery and briefly discuss our evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of FARS.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^77469fcf]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R consensus — nonpharmacologic spasticity management overview states that evidence remains unclear for many treatment options and that an integrated multidisciplinary, goal-centered management approach is essential to providing a long-term, comprehensive care for spasticity, with research needs including therapy components, modalities, duration, and setting; nonpharmacologic interventions may provide beneficial effects but clarity on optimal timing, duration, and intensity is limited; Table 5 summarizes common interventions and was developed from published systematic reviews; some options are known to be used in practice but more often in research settings and are included for patient or caregiver inquiries, and the AAPM&R Spasticity TEP is not providing a recommendation on their use or non-use due to lack of studies related to outcomes in spasticity including long-term efficacy and safety; listed options are hyperbaric oxygen therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, and intermittent theta burst stimulation.

### Botulinum toxins in pain management [^16235326]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

BTs are a useful treatment in refractory MPS and have shown promise in various superficial neuropathic pain syndromes. Presumably BTs work by breaking the spasm/pain cycle, giving the patient a "window of opportunity" for traditional conservative measures to have a greater beneficial impact, but several studies suggest that a direct antinociceptive effect distinct from any reduction in muscle spasm may be at play. The major benefit of BTs compared with standard therapies is duration of response. BTs cannot be considered a "first line" treatment for any pain application; however, in refractory cases in which nothing else has helped, BTs may offer the patient and physician a chance for improvement and perhaps even cure.

Muscle cramps are common in patients with liver disease and adversely influence quality of life. The exact mechanisms by which they occur remain unclear, although a number of pathophysiological events unique to liver disease may contribute. Clinical studies have identified alterations in 3 areas: nerve function, energy metabolism, and plasma volume/electrolytes. Treatments have focused on these particular areas with varied results. This review will focus on the clinical features of muscle cramps in patients with liver disease and review potential mechanisms and current therapies.

### Tizanidine: advances in pharmacology&therapeutics and drug formulations [^947bdd5f]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In addition to relieving muscle spasms and chronic musculoskeletal pain, tizanidine is a particular SMR that exhibits multiple beneficial characteristics. Tizanidine is a relatively safer SMR and seems to be friendly to older adults. It can be expected that there will be more scientific studies on tizanidine as well as wider therapeutic applications. New delivery systems will also be available to better meet clinical needs.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^93793b3f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain, commonly defined as pain that lasts beyond 3 months and/or extends past normal tissue healing time, affects millions of US residents, with a 2021 prevalence of 21%. More than 50 million US adults experience pain most days or every day, making chronic pain one of the most significant public health problems in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain, and the Department of Health and Human Services' National Pain Strategy call for a multimodal approach to pain management, incorporating nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options, leaving considerable latitude for shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Guidelines specific to certain pain syndromes, such as the American College of Physicians' clinical practice guideline on treatments for low back pain, emphasize nonopioid medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxant medications.

Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) are a pharmacologically diverse category of medications that include antispasticity and antispasmodic medications, such as baclofen, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and tizanidine. They are indicated for acute musculoskeletal conditions including spasms and low back pain; they are also used off-label for numerous other pain and nonpain conditions.SMRs are to be used with caution because of central nervous system adverse effects, including drowsiness and dizziness, particularly when used in combination with other centrally acting medications. Because of these adverse effects and a lack of evidence regarding the long-term efficacy of SMRs, recommendations generally limit their use to a maximum duration of 2 to 3 weeks. However, SMR prescribing doubled between 2005 and 2016, and physician visits for continuing SMR prescriptions tripled during the same period, indicating a shift toward longer duration of use and for nonacute (including chronic) pain syndromes.

### Pain management in a patient with intractable spinal cord injury pain: a case report and literature review [^9655b772]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is one of the more disturbing sequelae of spinal cord injury, often interfering with the basic activities, effective rehabilitation, and quality of life of the patient. Pain in the cord-injured patient is often recalcitrant to treatment. This dilemma is amplified by the limited availability of effective pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options. We identified relevant articles regarding pain after spinal cord injury from the Medline database from 1975 to 2005 using the search terms "spinal cord injury" or "spinal cord injuries" and "pain" or "spasticity or "muscle spasms". We also searched by hand the review articles in a recently published book from the International Association for the Study of Pain Press on spinal cord injury pain, and identified relevant articles through reference lists. We present a patient with intractable spinal cord injury pain who was successfully treated with a pain management plan that addressed the various aspects of spinal cord injury pain. The evidence for treatment options is reviewed.

### Commonly used muscle relaxant therapies for acute low back pain: a review of carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, and metaxalone [^823b9d70]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a leading reason for primary care visits. Many treatment options are available, but some lack scientific support.

Objective

The aim of this review was to discuss the etiology of low back pain and the relative risks and benefits of muscle relaxants commonly prescribed for the management of back pain.

Methods

We searched Intercontinental Marketing Services data for January 2003 through January 2004 to determine the most commonly prescribed agents for the management of musculoskeletal pain. Carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, and metaxalone represented > 45% of all such prescriptions. Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched (time frame: 1960 through January 2004; search terms: back pain, carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, muscle relaxants, and pharmacotherapy) and reference lists of identified articles were hand-searched.

Results

Three trials of carisoprodol (N = 197) were located in the Cochrane Library database. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (N = 1405) were identified in the literature. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were identified for metaxalone (N = 428) in 2 reports. The types of adverse events seen with these agents involved the central nervous system, including drowsiness/sedation, fatigue, and dizziness. However, the efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride was shown to be independent of its sedative effects, which were dose related. The potential for abuse with carisoprodol is of growing concern.

Conclusions

Analgesic pain management for low back pain due to muscle spasm may be combined with a muscle relaxant. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride has the most recent and largest clinical trials demonstrating its benefit, but carisoprodol and metaxalone also appear to be effective. However, carisoprodol's usefulness is mitigated by its potential for abuse.

Pharmacologic analgesia — anti-spasmodic agents: Patients with muscle spasms may benefit from anti-spasmodic agents (cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, diazepam), but these agents are sedating and require close monitoring; methocarbamol use is associated with decreased hospital length of stay in trauma patients with closed rib fractures and may play a role in this population.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^2b9747a5]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — definition, prevalence, and associated conditions are summarized as follows: Muscle cramps are involuntary, generally painful contractions of a muscle or muscle group. A cross-sectional prevalence study of 365 outpatients aged 65 or older in the United Kingdom reports that 50% of outpatients report frequent cramps, and another review of 515 elderly veterans reports a similar prevalence of 56%, with half having cramps occurring at least once per week. When the motor system is stressed, either by a neuromuscular disease or by a physiologic stress such as dehydration or excessive exercise, cramps become more frequent, and neuropathic conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), peripheral neuropathies, and cramp-fasciculation syndrome are commonly associated. In addition to neurologic conditions, multiple medical conditions such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, and renal or liver dysfunction may be the cause, and cramps are also frequent during the last trimester of pregnancy and in athletes such as marathon runners. When no underlying cause of recurrent muscle cramps can be identified, they are referred to as idiopathic muscle cramps, which are usually most prominent in the lower leg and foot muscles and more evident at night.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound therapy for myofascial pain syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f4c5bbd8]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a local syndrome featured with pain, muscle spasm, oversensitivity, and restricted range of motion due to trigger points (MTrps) on constricted fibers of muscles and fasciae.MPS is the most common cause of back pain, shoulder pain, tension-type headache, and regional pains (e.g. facial pain). It is one major cause of musculoskeletal system disability as it occurs in 37% of males and 65% of females at age 30–60 years.

Owing to stiff trapezius muscles in most cases, the most common complaint in MPS patients is neck and upper back pains. Although mechanical, nociceptive, and genetic pathologies and primary muscle dysfunctions play a role in the pathogenesis of MPS, the exact mechanisms are still unknown. Therefore, MPS is refractory and the outcomes may not always be satisfactory. The therapeutic goals are pain elimination, trigger point deactivation, and release of tight muscle bands. The common methods for the management of MPS are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise, acupuncture, trigger point injection, heat packs, and electrotherapy.

Ultrasound (US) has been widely popularized and recognized as a non-invasive treatment in the clinical and physiotherapy fields. US is composed of piezoelectric crystals that use high-frequency alternative current to transform electrical energy to mechanical oscillation energy. The thermal and non-thermal effects of US would transiently increase the flexibility of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules, which consequently decreases joint stiffness, pains, and accompanying muscle spasm and temporarily increases blood flow. The evidences on the effects of US on MPS are still controversial. Some studies demonstrate that the use of US for MPS considerably relieves pain intensity in the upper trapezius muscles (uTMs), but other studies do not show any obvious effect on pains or superiority over placebos.

Because of the existence of conflicting evidences and as no available reviews or meta-analyses were done before, it is necessary to reevaluate the existing evidences. Regarding these studies, we comprehensively searched the literature and evaluated the effectiveness of US on pain relief and physical improvement in MPS patients.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review [^b407a74d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are a heterogeneous group of medications used to treat two different types of underlying conditions: spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes and muscular pain or spasms from peripheral musculoskeletal conditions. Although widely used for these indications, there appear to be gaps in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety of different skeletal muscle relaxants. This systematic review summarizes and assesses the evidence for the comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions. Randomized trials (for comparative efficacy and adverse events) and observational studies (for adverse events only) that included oral medications classified as skeletal muscle relaxants by the FDA were sought using electronic databases, reference lists, and pharmaceutical company submissions. Searches were performed through January 2003. The validity of each included study was assessed using a data abstraction form and predefined criteria. An overall grade was allocated for the body of evidence for each key question. A total of 101 randomized trials were included in this review. No randomized trial was rated good quality, and there was little evidence of rigorous adverse event assessment in included trials or observational studies. There is fair evidence that baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene are effective compared to placebo in patients with spasticity (primarily multiple sclerosis). There is fair evidence that baclofen and tizanidine are roughly equivalent for efficacy in patients with spasticity, but insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of dantrolene compared to baclofen or tizanidine. There is fair evidence that although the overall rate of adverse effects between tizanidine and baclofen is similar, tizanidine is associated with more dry mouth and baclofen with more weakness. There is fair evidence that cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine, and tizanidine are effective compared to placebo in patients with musculoskeletal conditions (primarily acute back or neck pain). Cyclobenzaprine has been evaluated in the most clinical trials and has consistently been found to be effective. There is very limited or inconsistent data regarding the effectiveness of metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, baclofen, or dantrolene compared to placebo in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relative efficacy or safety of cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine, tizanidine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, and chlorzoxazone. Dantrolene, and to a lesser degree chlorzoxazone, have been associated with rare serious hepatotoxicity.

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant… [^1ebfe66d]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence of Effectiveness Many of the studies evaluating the effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants are hampered by poor methodologic design, including incomplete reporting of compliance, improper or no mention of allocation concealment, not utilizing intention-to-treat methods, and inadequate randomization. 17, 18 Nonetheless, skeletal muscle relaxants have been evaluated in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. 28 A Cochrane review analyzed three high-quality trials that showed tizanidine plus analgesics was more effective in providing pain relief and decreasing muscle spasm than analgesics alone. 17 Conversely, one low-quality open-label study comparing cyclobenzaprine alone versus combination with ibuprofen showed that, although all groups improved at seven days, there was no statistical difference in outcomes among the groups.

Place in Therapy Although the evidence for effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants in musculoskeletal conditions is limited, strong evidence does exist in terms of toxicity. In acute low back pain trials, skeletal muscle relaxants increased overall adverse effects and central nervous system adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness. Selection of a skeletal muscle relaxant should be individualized to the patient. If there are tender spots over the muscle or trigger points on physical examination, a skeletal muscle relaxant is a reasonable adjunct to analgesic treatment of low back pain. Skeletal muscle relaxants may also be used as an alternative to NSAIDs in patients who are at risk of gastrointestinal or renal complications. Patients with low back pain or fibromyalgia may benefit from treatment with cyclobenzaprine.

Recent evidence showed similar effectiveness at half of its manufacturer recommended dose, but with fewer adverse effects. Carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate and has been shown to produce psychological and physical dependence. 34 Carisoprodol and diazepam should be reserved for last-line therapy because of their abuse potential and lack of superiority to other skeletal muscle relaxants. Although all skeletal muscle relaxants should be used with caution in older patients, diazepam especially should be avoided in older patients or in patients with significant cognitive or hepatic impairment.

### Bilateral femoral neck fractures and fixation failure due to stiff-person syndrome [^cdd293af]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We describe a woman with stiff-person syndrome (SPS), whose muscle spasms resulted in sequential bilateral femoral neck fractures. Orthopaedic fixation of the first fracture was complicated by increased muscle spasm, fracture nonunion and ultimately metalwork fracture. SPS was diagnosed following the fracture of the contralateral femoral neck, neurology assessment and detection of high-titre antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase. Multidisciplinary management with high-dose benzodiazepines, intravenous immunoglobulin infusions, and bilateral total hip replacements achieved a good functional outcome. Spasms associated with SPS are a rare cause of pathological fractures and may cause orthopaedic fixation to fail. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are essential to prevent additional morbidity.

Possible Differential Diagnoses

Pain symptoms associated with the cervical spine can be linked to several specific and non-specific reasons, similar to those mentioned in the lumbar area. Specific causes of the condition include degenerative problems affecting the discs and vertebrae, such as discopathies involving protrusions, bulging, and herniations of the discs, as well as osteodegenerative spondyloarthritic issues. These issues can lead to the formation of osteophytes and even bony bridges between neighboring vertebrae. Cervical discopathy can result in compression of the discs in the neck, causing nerve involvement and potential disruptions to the nervous system. This can lead to neuropathic disturbances, with symptoms radiating to the upper limb on the same side as the affected disc. This article explores several primary muscular causes of cervicalgia and shoulder discomfort, which can arise from different underlying conditions.

A traumatic experience, muscle spasm or contracture, postural defects, or poor posture while working or sleeping can all be potential causes of muscular symptoms. The most common diagnoses affecting cervical spine include whiplash, cervical OA, muscle injury, myofascial syndrome (trigger points), discopathy, and tension-type headache. The most common issues affecting shoulder muscles are acute or chronic tendinopathy, subacromial impingement, tendinopathy of the long head of the biceps brachii, and Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), a form of exercise-induced muscle damage that should be considered in subjects who practice sports.

Superficial Heat Therapy (SHT)

Heatwraps are a potential component of a multimodal therapy or alleviating somatic muscle pain in patients experiencing cervical discomfort due to predominant muscular disorders, such as muscle spasms or contractures. To reduce the persistent muscle contractions resulting from various issues, such as strains on the cervical spine, postural disorders, or issues that arise from biomechanical overload (such as repetitive movements or prolonged postures), the authors recommend this therapeutic approach once the acute phase ends.

To prevent a temporary exacerbation of the local inflammatory problem, the authors suggest using external thermotherapy as part of a multimodal treatment only if there is no evidence of radicular involvement. For patients showing sensory and motor symptoms of nerve root involvement, it is essential to adhere to the primary international guidelines for treating cervical pain with a neuropathic element. Heat therapy should be employed only after the resolution of the more acute radicular inflammatory problem.

### Muscle cramps… [^823f89a7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Painful involuntary skeletal muscle contractions, or cramps, are common patient complaints and may be classified as examples of true cramp, tetany, contracture, or dystonia. The pathophysiologic and clinical features of each of these diagnoses are described. The approach to the patient with cramps should emphasize the history, physical examination, and, if the diagnosis is unclear, minimal routine laboratory data. Although many therapies have been proposed for ordinary cramps, the best evidence supports stretching exercises and quinine. Areas for future study of this common symptom are proposed. McGee SR.

### Rare phenomena of central rhythm and pattern generation in a case of complete spinal cord injury [^5e75df24]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Muscle activation patterns do not differ between spinal myoclonus and muscle spasms

In seven examples, spinal myoclonus followed lower-limb manipulations by the examiner that elicited either seconds-long proprioceptive activation (through a single cycle of passive hip-and-knee or ankle flexion-extension movement) or cutaneous activation from the foot sole (cf. Supplementary Table 2). No examples were found following a tendon tap or a brisk manual dorsiflexion to elicit an ankle clonus (cf. Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that spinal myoclonus was not readily evoked by brief proprioceptive volleys to the spinal cord.

The passive movements as well as plantar stimulation always elicited muscle spasms, (Supplementary Fig. 1) that had consistent electromyographic patterns when evoked repeatedly during the same neurological examination (Supplementary Fig. 4), irrespective of whether a myoclonus followed or not (Fig. 3a). The muscle spasms were characterized by a spread to multiple ipsilateral and contralateral muscles, resulting in complex muscle activation patterns outlasting the duration of the manipulation. Thus, the initially recruited spinal networks were always those underlying the generation of muscle spasms. Spinal myoclonus evolved from these muscle spasms after a silent period or a period of tonic activity (Fig. 3a(i), b) and never involved muscles other than those already recruited into the spasms. Noticeably, the electromyographic patterns of the myoclonus bursts closely resembled that of the spasms, indicative of common pattern generating networks (Fig. 3c). Indeed, muscle activation patterns did not differ statistically between muscle spasms and spinal myoclonus bursts; no significant interaction effect existed between the type of activity and muscle on the respective integrated electromyographic activities, F (9;120) = 1.097, p = 0.370, = 0.076.

### Management of refractory pain in stiff-person syndrome [^344cc4da]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterised by episodic painful muscle rigidity and violent spasms. A significant trigger for the painful spasms experienced by patients is pain itself, making optimal pain management and avoidance a necessity. While first-line and second-line therapies for spasm prevention and termination are known, there is a paucity of evidence to guide pain management. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with SPS referred for excruciating muscle cramping and rigidity with pain lasting beyond the episodes themselves. We report the novel use of ketamine and intravenous magnesium sulfate which may provide analgesia, spasm avoidance and early termination of exacerbations in SPS.

### Infantile spasms (west syndrome): update and resources for pediatricians and providers to share with parents [^2305765f]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile spasms (IS; West syndrome) is a severe form of epilepsy of early infancy. Although IS was first described over 160 years ago, its diagnosis, evaluation, and management continue to pose many challenges to health care professionals and affected families. Educating pediatricians and general pediatric health care providers about IS may be especially important as a recent IS working group (ISWG) of pediatric neurologists reviewed the literature and determined that early recognition of IS and prompt treatment are mandatory and may improve developmental and cognitive outcomes in some patients. IS presents with myoclonic-tonic seizures (spasms) that may be characterized by flexor, extensor, or mixed movements, a distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of hypsarrhythmia, and psychomotor delay/arrest. The incidence of IS ranges from 2 to 3.5/10,000 live births, with onset during the first year of life in 90% of those affected. This translates to approximately 2,000 to 2,500 new cases per year in the United States. The peak age of onset is between 3 and 7 months; onset after 18 months is rare, though onset up to 4 years of age has been reported. Spasms usually cease by 5 years of age, but other seizure types are reported in as many as 60% of children with IS even after cessation of spasms. IS occurs in children from all ethnic groups, and boys are affected slightly more often than girls (ratio of 60:40).

### Acute respiratory failure in a patient with stiff-person syndrome [^024834aa]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasms involving the axial muscles. Acute respiratory distress has rarely been reported in this condition.

Methods

We report a case of a 49-year-old woman with autoimmune SPS diagnosed during an episode of acute respiratory failure secondary to repetitive episodes of apnea, requiring intensive care.

Results

Acute respiratory failure manifesting with apneic episodes is a life-threatening and unpredictable complication of SPS. Its pathophysiology is not well known. The two suggested mechanisms are as follows: (1) apnea due to muscle rigidity and paroxysmal muscle spasms, and (2) paroxysmal autonomic hyperactivity. Sudden and unexpected deaths have been reported in SPS, and all described cases have been associated with apnea. Thus, the onset of apnea during SPS should be considered a criterion of high severity and should lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission for continuous monitoring. In patients with severe disease who are unresponsive to symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen, or in patients with life-threatening complications, early immunotherapy by intravenous immunoglobulins should be considered.

Conclusion

Onset of apneas during SPS should be considered as a signal of possible progression toward acute respiratory failure and sudden death, and should lead to ICU admission for continuous monitoring. Early immunotherapy should be started in such situations, including intravenous immunoglobulins as the first-line treatment.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b7d2aa20]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — bosutinib adverse events and discontinuations are characterized in the BFORE study, where diarrhea, increased ALT/AST and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common with bosutinib, while muscle spasms, peripheral edema, and grade 3/4 neutropenia were more common with imatinib; grade 3/4 anemia was similar. Discontinuation for drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% with bosutinib versus 11% with imatinib, with increased ALT (5%) and increased AST (2%) the most common causes, and there were no hepatotoxicity-related fatalities during the study.

Neurological Symptoms During Syncope

The protocol asked the investigators to record event‐related "muscle spasms, 1 sided", "muscle spasms, 2 sided", and "grand mal", and all of these were or tended to be more common in men (2.7% vs 0.3%, = 0.028; 4.9% vs 2.0%, = 0.061; and 3.0% vs 0.7%, = 0.05, respectively). "Other muscle spasms" were equally common in men and women (3.3% and 2.6%, respectively). More men than women visited a neurologist, at all or as the last specialist in their care pathway before the ILR implant (53% vs 43%, = 0.023 and 6% vs 2%, = 0.031, respectively). These figures also imply that diagnoses other than neurological causes were found in the majority of patients and/or that a specialist other than a neurologist eventually referred the patient for an ILR (Table 2). Palpitations (17% vs 10%, = 0.013) and dyspnea (9% vs 3%, = 0.003) were more common in women than in men, especially in women < 65 years. Similarly, spasms and grand mal seizures were reported more frequently, and a neurologist was more often the first visited specialist in patients < 65 years of age.

Syncope Recurrence and Diagnostic Yield of the Implantable Loop Recorder

Recurrent syncope occurred in 218 patients (38%) during follow‐up. Women tended to have a lower risk of recurrence during the first year after the ILR implant than men (hazard ratio: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–1.01). There was no difference between men and women in the time from implant to recurrence with a diagnosis (Figure 2). The recurrence rates were 36% and 35% vs 44% and 38% in patients < 65 years and ≥ 65 years old, respectively.
