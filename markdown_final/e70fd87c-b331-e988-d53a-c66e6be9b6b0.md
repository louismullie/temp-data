## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to differentiate between sensation and perception and select the best answer among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of sensation versus perception. Then, I should verify the temporal sequence of processing. Next, I will examine hierarchical models that separate registration from interpretation. After that, I need to check for exceptions where the boundary blurs. Finally, I will evaluate each answer choice against these criteria and choose the one that aligns with both clinical and cognitive neuroscience usage.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Sensation refers to the basic registration of stimuli by sensory receptors and their transmission to the central nervous system, whereas perception is the higher-order process of recognizing, interpreting, and giving meaning to those sensory inputs. This distinction is explicit in clinical frameworks and reviews of somatosensation, where registration (sensation) is detection of a stimulus above threshold, and perception is the understanding or interpretation of that stimulus, including spatial, temporal, and modality-specific components [^4aa41791] [^ca62ec64].

> Wait, let me verify the sequence so I don't misstate the flow. Sensation precedes perception in normal processing: receptors transduce energy into neural signals, these are relayed to the CNS, and then perceptual systems integrate and interpret those signals to create meaningful experience. This bottom-up to top-down flow is foundational in both sensory neuroscience and clinical symptom models, including dyspnea, where multiple sensory afferents contribute to distinct perceptual qualities that patients report [^7c00cf3b] [^e3579d07].

> Hold on, I should verify the hierarchical model that separates registration from interpretation. The WHO ICF-based definition used in stroke rehabilitation distinguishes sensation/registration as stimulus detection from perception as recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli, and this is echoed in pediatric neurorehabilitation literature that categorizes somatosensory function into registration versus perception domains, reinforcing that perception builds upon sensation rather than being synonymous with it [^ca62ec64] [^4aa41791].

> I need to check for exceptions where the boundary can blur. In some contexts, perception can modulate what is sensed via attention and expectation, and certain perceptual phenomena can occur with minimal or even subliminal sensory input, illustrating that perception is not purely passive. However, these are modulation effects and do not overturn the basic principle that sensation provides the raw data upon which perception operates [^2a5a3ff8] [^6ffca68e].

> Now, let me evaluate each option carefully. Option A claims sensation and perception are the same process, which contradicts the hierarchical distinction between registration and interpretation, so I should reject it [^4aa41791]. Option B states that sensations are basic elementary experiences that we interpret into meaningful events, and that this interpretation is perception, which matches the standard definitions and sequence, so this looks correct [^4aa41791] [^ca62ec64]. Option C says sensations are the interpretation of our senses, which reverses the order and conflates perception with sensation, so I should reject it [^4aa41791]. Option D claims sensations are the process of organizing and interpreting sensory information, but that organizing/interpretive step is perception, not sensation, so this is incorrect [^4aa41791]. Option E says perception is the initial data collection through sensory organs, but data collection is sensation, so this is backwards and wrong [^4aa41791]. Option F says sensations are conscious experiences triggered by perception, which inverts the causal flow and is incorrect [^4aa41791]. Option G claims perception occurs before sensation, which is not supported by the bottom-up sequence in normal processing, so I should reject it [^4aa41791]. Option H says perception is the mental reconstruction of sensations into past experiences, which is too narrow and imprecise; perception is the interpretation of current sensory input, not solely a reconstruction of memories, so this is misleading [^4aa41791]. Option I claims sensations are complex understanding while perception is initial input, which again reverses the correct order and is wrong [^4aa41791]. Option J says perception is the physical process of sensing, but sensing is the physical process of sensation, so this conflates terms and is incorrect [^4aa41791].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Option H might be acceptable because perception can draw on prior experience, but I should double-check that nuance. While top-down processes and prior knowledge shape perception, perception is fundamentally the interpretation of current sensory input, not a mere reconstruction of past experiences, so Option H overstates the memory component and mischaracterizes the primary process, making Option B the cleaner and more accurate choice [^2a5a3ff8] [^4aa41791].

> Final answer: B. Sensations provide us with basic elementary experiences which we further interpret into meaningful events. This interpretation of sensations is called 'perception'. This aligns with the clinical and cognitive neuroscience distinction that sensation is registration of stimuli and perception is the recognition and interpretation of those stimuli, preserving the correct temporal and hierarchical relationship between the two processes [^4aa41791] [^ca62ec64].

---

The correct answer is **B**. Sensation is the raw, unprocessed input from sensory organs (e.g. light, sound, touch), whereas perception is the brain's interpretation of that input into meaningful experiences (e.g. seeing a face, hearing music, feeling pain) [^4aa41791] [^ca62ec64]. Options A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J are incorrect because they either conflate sensation with perception or reverse their sequence or roles [^4aa41791].

## Definitions and distinctions

### Sensation

Sensation is the **basic registration of stimuli** by sensory receptors and their transmission to the brain [^4aa41791]. It is the initial, unprocessed data — such as light intensity, sound frequency, or pressure — that the nervous system detects [^196987f3]. Sensation is **bottom-up** and largely automatic, occurring before conscious interpretation [^e3579d07].

---

### Perception

Perception is the **interpretation and organization of sensory input** into meaningful experiences [^ca62ec64]. It is a top-down process that integrates sensory data with prior knowledge, expectations, and context to create a coherent understanding of the environment [^2a5a3ff8]. Perception is **conscious and subjective**, shaped by individual experiences and cognitive processes [^f059465b].

---

## Key differences

| **Aspect** | **Sensation** | **Perception** |
|-|-|-|
| Process | Bottom-up, automatic | Top-down, interpretive |
| Level | Basic, unprocessed | Complex, meaningful |
| Awareness | Often unconscious | Conscious |
| Role | Raw data input | Interpretation and meaning |

---

## Examples illustrating the distinction

- **Vision**: Sensation is the detection of light wavelengths and intensity; perception is recognizing a face, identifying an object, or interpreting a scene [^896171c2].
- **Audition**: Sensation is the registration of sound waves; perception is understanding speech, recognizing a melody, or locating a sound source [^2a5a3ff8].
- **Touch**: Sensation is the feeling of pressure or temperature; perception is identifying textures, shapes, or objects by touch [^63b88cb8].

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **Option A**: Sensation and perception are distinct processes, not identical [^4aa41791].
- **Option C**: Sensation is not the interpretation of senses; interpretation is perception [^ca62ec64].
- **Option D**: Sensation is not the process of organizing and interpreting; that is perception [^4aa41791].
- **Option E**: Perception is not the initial data collection; data collection is sensation [^4aa41791].
- **Option F**: Sensations are not triggered by perception; sensations precede perception [^4aa41791].
- **Option G**: Perception does not occur before sensation; sensation precedes perception [^4aa41791].
- **Option H**: Perception is not solely reconstruction of past experiences; it integrates current sensory input with prior knowledge [^2a5a3ff8].
- **Option I**: Sensations are not complex understanding; complex understanding is perception [^4aa41791].
- **Option J**: Perception is not the physical process of sensing; sensing is sensation [^4aa41791].

---

## Conclusion

Sensation is the **raw input** from the environment, whereas perception is the **meaningful interpretation** of that input. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how we experience and interact with the world [^4aa41791].

### Agency, embodiment and enactment in psychosomatic theory and practice [^b9fe6a38]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Agency involves the sense of ownership, causality, control and responsibility for actions which are related to our goals, plans and intentions. The 4-E perspective sees agency as arising from loops of action and perception. 46 These loops may result in certain actions being interpreted as agentic because we experience the covariation of our attention, goals, actions and sensations in real time, particularly when we shift our actions in response to a change in goals or intention. 47 The dynamics of these action-perception loops then provide a basic sense of ownership and agency, but the experience and ascription of agency also depends on the interpretive frameworks we bring to bear. 48 Moreover, these action loops can extend into the social world to include others who may be part of the process of experiencing agency. Causality and control need not be aligned. Cause may involve a long chain of events including the actions of others, our own previous actions, and features of the acting body and its current context. Control may also reflect multiple processes that are hierarchically structured, with lower-level processes that are more or less automatic (reflexes, habits), and higher-level choices or decision-making that may involve conscious deliberation or consultation with others. 49.

Still finer gradations of agency can be distinguished by considering: (1) multiple (top-down cognitive) controls in action; (2) the intervening functions of affective dispositions and emotions; (3) the affordances and constraints of contexts (norms, expectations, elicitations or invitations), including forms of instrumentality and discursive possibilities; (4) the consequences of actions for social positioning and the responses of others; and (5) the wider social, economic and political processes that give individuals or groups voice, power, resources and authority. Each of these gives rise to alterations in the experience of agency — each can support and stabilise or fractionate and disrupt the other. This gives rise to a rich set of potential distinctions for human agency. Unfortunately, we lack clinical language for these distinctions and our everyday thinking confounds causality and control so that, in practice, we usually fall back on a simple dichotomy: wilful or not. This has important consequences for the ways we think about causality, responsibility and blame in health and illness.

### Consciousness [^f059465b]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

Consciousness is topical, for reasons including its renewed respectability among psychologists, rapid progress in the neuroscience of perception, memory and action, advances in artificial intelligence and dissatisfaction with the dualistic separation of mind and body. Consciousness is an ambiguous term. It can refer to (i) the waking state; (ii) experience; and (iii) the possession of any mental state. Self-consciousness is equally ambiguous, with senses including (i) proneness to embarrassment in social settings; (ii) the ability to detect our own sensations and recall our recent actions; (iii) self-recognition; (iv) the awareness of awareness; and (v) self-knowledge in the broadest sense. The understanding of states of consciousness has been transformed by the delineation of their electrical correlates, of structures in brainstem and diencephalon which regulate the sleep-wake cycle, and of these structures' cellular physiology and regional pharmacology. Clinical studies have defined pathologies of wakefulness: coma, the persistent vegetative state, the 'locked-in' syndrome, akinetic mutism and brain death. Interest in the neural basis of perceptual awareness has focused on vision. Increasingly detailed neuronal correlates of real and illusory visual experience are being defined. Experiments exploiting circumstances in which visual experience changes while external stimulation is held constant are tightening the experimental link between consciousness and its neural correlates. Work on unconscious neural processes provides a complementary approach. 'Unperceived' stimuli have detectable effects on neural events and subsequent action in a range of circumstances: blindsight provides the classical example. Other areas of cognitive neuroscience also promise experimental insights into consciousness, in particular the distinctions between implicit and explicit memory and deliberate and automatic action. Overarching scientific theories of consciousness include neurobiological accounts which specify anatomical or physiological mechanisms for awareness, theories focusing on the role played by conscious processes in information processing and theories envisaging the functions of consciousness in a social context. Whether scientific observation and theory will yield a complete account of consciousness remains a live issue. Physicalism, functionalism, property dualism and dual aspect theories attempt to do justice to three central, but controversial, intuitions about experience: that it is a robust phenomenon which calls for explanation, that it is intimately related to the activity of the brain and that it has an important influence on behaviour.

### On the perception of probable things: neural substrates of associative memory, imagery, and perception [^20fc9968]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Perception is influenced both by the immediate pattern of sensory inputs and by memories acquired through prior experiences with the world. Throughout much of its illustrious history, however, study of the cellular basis of perception has focused on neuronal structures and events that underlie the detection and discrimination of sensory stimuli. Relatively little attention has been paid to the means by which memories interact with incoming sensory signals. Building upon recent neurophysiological/behavioral studies of the cortical substrates of visual associative memory, I propose a specific functional process by which stored information about the world supplements sensory inputs to yield neuronal signals that can account for visual perceptual experience. This perspective represents a significant shift in the way we think about the cellular bases of perception.

### A Bayesian account of' hysteria' [^5b09dd3b]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

A unified theory for functional motor and sensory symptoms

Our premise is that all FMSS are created by attentional and belief-driven processes. These processes might involve subcortical affective factors in many patients, but we believe such factors are not always necessary and are certainly not sufficient to produce FMSS. Below, we explain how a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of brain function can account for the generation of FMSS by attentional and belief-driven processes, and how such processes — operating within the normal functional anatomy of perception and voluntary movement — might generate symptoms that are interpreted by patients as involuntary and unwilled.

The hierarchical Bayesian formulation of brain function

To understand the failures of perceptual inference that may underpin FMSS, it is necessary to consider the precise neurobiological mechanisms that underlie perception and attention. In turn, this requires a formal understanding of these processes in computational terms. In what follows, we appeal to recent advances in theoretical neurobiology that link perceptual inference, at the representational level, to functional anatomy and synaptic processes.

Given the extensive evidence for a hierarchical structure in the brain, it is reasonable to suggest that any generative model of the brain will also have hierarchical structure where the outputs of one level provide inputs to the next. Our neurobiological explanation for FMSS rests on hierarchical Bayesian models of the brain underwritten by a theory of nervous system function called the 'free-energy principle'. The free-energy principle asserts that any adaptive change made by a biological system or organism must minimize its long-term average surprise. Surprise in this context means unexpected (i.e. unpredicted) sensations. Because the long-term average of surprise corresponds to the entropy (dispersion) of sensations, a failure to minimize surprise would lead to a progressive increase in entropy (sensory disorder) and violate the principles of self-organization and homoeostasis that are characteristic of biological systems. Organisms can minimize their sensory surprise by constructing a hierarchical model of how sensations (exteroceptive, interoceptive and proprioceptive) are caused. Sensory surprise can then be minimized by reducing prediction errors, based on the predictions of the model; either by changing sensory samples through action or by changing the predictions through perception. In this framework, perception corresponds to optimizing the model by changing synaptic activity and connection strengths to minimize prediction errors. This is known as predictive coding in the computational literature and the model is said to be generative because it generates sensory predictions given probabilistic beliefs about their causes.

### Interpreting intracorporeal landscapes: how patients visualize pathophysiology and utilize medical images in their understanding of chronic musculoskeletal illness [^89409892]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

While some people seek to communicate their painful condition to others to gain social legitimation, secure help and possibly redemption, others visualize, imagine or depict their painful condition to objectify their pain and to complete their own understanding, or to provide an external expression of their internal worlds. In the process, individuals may call upon both experiences from their everyday life-world and more formal referents drawn from biomedical discourse.

Thus, individuals objectify pain to make sense of it, to orientate themselves towards its origins, and ultimately to expel unpleasant feelings. Disease and symptoms may be depersonalized and objectified as "the" or "it", as something distinct from – and often inimical to – the self, suggesting a reflection on the mind-body relationship. As Leder [, p.262] puts it: "Whereas in day-to-day events we are our body without hesitation, suddenly pain renders the body disharmonious with the self". There is consequently an attempt to make sense of one's experience first to oneself and then to others. Lay interpretations and descriptions of pain and disease indicate a struggle to familiarize sensations, to make sense of the body when it no longer functions as before, to give meaning to these events. As Leder [, p.78] suggests, "Pain exerts a telic [purposeful] demand upon us", which gives rise to a search for interpretation and understanding, "where the body becomes the object of an ongoing interpretive quest". Leder gives the example of an injured tennis player who stops the game, not just out of an inability to continue, but to seek the origin, extent, and significance of the pain, so that he or she may then be able to take reparatory action or to cope with the existential challenge of pain.

### Weaker top-down cognitive control and stronger bottom-up signaling transmission as a pathogenesis of schizophrenia [^e3579d07]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe, progressive mental disorder impacting roughly 1% of individuals worldwide, often emerging during the most productive life phase of 15–35 years. Annual costs for the schizophrenia population ranged from US$94 million to US$102 billion in different countries. The economic burden of schizophrenia was estimated to range from 0.02% to 1.65% of the gross domestic product. The quest for definitive biological markers, pathogenesis and effective treatments for schizophrenia continues, complicated by the disorder's heterogeneity.

Schizophrenia has a variety of heterogeneous clinical symptoms, including cognitive disturbances (such as suspiciousness or persecution delusions, lack of spontaneity and fluency in conversation, and attention disorders)and perceptual disturbances (such as hallucinations). Current research on schizophrenia primarily focuses on two directions: neuropsychological research centered on cognitive impairmentsand phenomenological studies that emphasize abnormal perceptual experiences. Therefore, many scholars have studied pathological mechanism of schizophrenia from the perspective of the cognitive and perceptual mechanism of the brain. Understanding cognitive and perceptual mechanisms in the human brain involves examining how we process information from the world around us. These processes can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: top-down and bottom-up processing. Top-down processing is concept-driven and relies on higher-level cognitive functions like memory, expectations, and prior knowledge. Instead of starting with raw sensory data, top-down processing involves using existing knowledge to interpret and give meaning to incoming stimuli. In top-down processing, which is related to the prefrontal cortex, our brains make predictions about what we are likely to perceive based on context or previous experiences. For instance, when you read a sentence with missing letters, your brain can often fill in the blanks based on your understanding of language. This ability to predict or infer information demonstrates how top-down processing guides perception by shaping how we interpret sensory input. On the other hand, bottom-up processing refers to the way our brain builds a perceptual experience from basic sensory inputs. This process is often described as data-driven because it begins with raw data from the environment, such as light, sound, or touch. The sensory organs (eyes, ears, skin, etc.) detect this information and send it to the brain for further analysis. The brain then assembles these individual sensory signals into a coherent perception. For example, in visual perception, bottom-up processing starts with the detection of basic features such as edges, colors, and shapes. The visual cortex analyzes these components and progressively constructs more complex representations, such as recognizing objects or scenes. This type of processing is generally automatic and does not require prior knowledge or experience. In summary, in normal brain mechanisms, bottom-up processing is responsible for providing raw data, while top-down processing is responsible for interpreting the raw data based on prior information. However, alterations in the underlying neural mechanisms of schizophrenia have been observed, suggesting significant deviations from typical brain function.

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^8fc2bddc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Perception is the ability to understand information from our senses. It allows us to experience and meaningfully interact with our environment. A stroke may impair perception in up to 70% of stroke survivors, leading to distress, increased dependence on others, and poorer quality of life. Interventions to address perceptual disorders may include assessment and screening, rehabilitation, non‐invasive brain stimulation, pharmacological and surgical approaches.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at perceptual disorders after stroke compared to no intervention or control (placebo, standard care, attention control), on measures of performance in activities of daily living.

Search methods

We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases to August 2021. We also searched trials and research registers, reference lists of studies, handsearched journals, and contacted authors.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult stroke survivors with perceptual disorders. We defined perception as the specific mental functions of recognising and interpreting sensory stimuli and included hearing, taste, touch, smell, somatosensation, and vision. Our definition of perception excluded visual field deficits, neglect/inattention, and pain.

Data collection and analysis

One review author assessed titles, with two review authors independently screening abstracts and full‐text articles for eligibility. One review author extracted, appraised, and entered data, which were checked by a second author. We assessed risk of bias (ROB) using the ROB‐1 tool, and quality of evidence using GRADE.

A stakeholder group, comprising stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, was involved in this review update.

Main results

We identified 18 eligible RCTs involving 541 participants. The trials addressed touch (three trials, 70 participants), somatosensory (seven trials, 196 participants) and visual perception disorders (seven trials, 225 participants), with one (50 participants) exploring mixed touch‐somatosensory disorders. None addressed stroke‐related hearing, taste, or smell perception disorders. All but one examined the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions; the exception evaluated non‐invasive brain stimulation. For our main comparison of active intervention versus no treatment or control, one trial reported our primary outcome of performance in activities of daily living (ADL):

Somatosensory disorders: one trial (24 participants) compared an intervention with a control intervention and reported an ADL measure.

Touch perception disorder: no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or with a control intervention.

Visual perception disorders: no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or control.

In addition, six trials reported ADL outcomes in a comparison of active intervention versus active intervention, relating to somatosensation (three trials), touch (one trial) and vision (two trials).

Authors' conclusions

Following a detailed, systematic search, we identified limited RCT evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that perceptual interventions are effective. More high‐quality trials of interventions for perceptual disorders in stroke are needed. They should recruit sufficient participant numbers, include a 'usual care' comparison, and measure longer‐term functional outcomes, at time points beyond the initial intervention period. People with impaired perception following a stroke should continue to receive neurorehabilitation according to clinical guidelines.

### Meaning in meaninglessness: the propensity to perceive meaningful patterns in coincident events and randomly arranged stimuli is linked to enhanced attention in early sensory processing [^e2bc565a]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Perception of objectively independent events or stimuli as being significantly connected and the associated proneness to perceive meaningful patterns constitute part of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, which are associated with altered attentional processes in lateralized speech perception. Since perceiving meaningful patterns is to some extent already prevalent in the general population, the aim of the study was to investigate whether the propensity to experience meaningful patterns in co-occurring events and random stimuli may be associated with similar altered attentional processes in lateralized speech perception. Self-reported and behavioral indicators of the perception of meaningful patterns were assessed in non-clinical individuals, along with EEG auditory evoked potentials during the performance of an attention related lateralized speech perception task (Dichotic Listening Test). A greater propensity to perceive meaningful patterns was associated with higher N1 amplitudes of the evoked potentials to the onset of the dichotically presented consonant-vowel syllables, indicating enhanced automatic attention in early sensory processing. The study suggests that more basic mechanisms in how people associate events may play a greater role in the cognitive biases that are manifest in personality expressions such as positive schizotypy, rather than that positive schizotypy moderates these cognitive biases directly.

### Human brain activity time-locked to perceptual event boundaries [^a7719f38]. Nature Neuroscience (2001). Medium credibility.

Temporal structure has a major role in human understanding of everyday events. Observers are able to segment ongoing activity into temporal parts and sub-parts that are reliable, meaningful and correlated with ecologically relevant features of the action. Here we present evidence that a network of brain regions is tuned to perceptually salient event boundaries, both during intentional event segmentation and during naive passive viewing of events. Activity within this network may provide a basis for parsing the temporally evolving environment into meaningful units.

### Discovering event structure in continuous narrative perception and memory [^17996864]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

During realistic, continuous perception, humans automatically segment experiences into discrete events. Using a novel model of cortical event dynamics, we investigate how cortical structures generate event representations during narrative perception and how these events are stored to and retrieved from memory. Our data-driven approach allows us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain activity without relying on stimulus annotations and reveals a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions to long events in high-order areas (including angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex), which represent abstract, multimodal situation models. High-order event boundaries are coupled to increases in hippocampal activity, which predict pattern reinstatement during later free recall. These areas also show evidence of anticipatory reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative. Based on these results, we propose that brain activity is naturally structured into nested events, which form the basis of long-term memory representations.

### Emotional event perception is related to lexical complexity and emotion knowledge [^6ea0dc01]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

How do we come to infer what others are feeling? This skill, widely known as emotion perception or emotion recognition, is often studied as if emotions are objects that can be recognized from isolated facial expressions or other non-verbal behaviors. This object perception framework not only has intuitive appeal for navigating our social worlds but would provide a powerful basis for applications within fields like healthcare, consumer behavior, artificial intelligenceand law enforcement. Here, responding to accumulating evidence that the object perception framework lacks strong empirical support, we pursue an alternative framework for assessing emotion perception: as a form of event perception. This event perception framework better captures individual variation and cultural consensus in the emotions that are inferred from naturalistic emotional cues, which are embedded in context. Further, studying emotions as events can reveal how individual differences in language and accessible knowledge about emotions shape our inferences about emotions in others.

Accumulating evidence on the generation and perception of emotional cues is inconsistent with the dominant object perception framework. First, this object perception framework is motivated by the assumption that there is a robust mapping between facial actions and inner emotional experiences. Yet people only rarely generate predicted patterns of facial expressions during instances of emotion, and there is remarkable diversity in the range of facial cues that are used to convey the same emotion. For example, if there was robust mapping between the internal emotional state of anger and scowling, studying how people perceive isolated scowls would be sufficient to understand how people perceive anger. However, there are many instances when an individual could infer anger that is not captured by a paradigm where a scowling expression is presented to a perceiver. The empirical evidence does not imply that there is no signaling via the face or other channels in emotional episodes but instead implies that the signaling is complex and variable. Second, perceivers appear to rely heavily on contextual cues when inferring emotion, including physical contexts like scenes, and what a target is doing with their body –, information about the unfolding situation, and the meanings conveyed by what others say. This implies that the face rarely acts as a simple object of perception in everyday life, in contrast to how psychology experiments are typically conducted. Third, emotion perception is strongly constrained by language. Not only is emotion perception performance sensitive to the language embedded in tasks, but other context effects are most robust when they invoke language, suggesting that the concepts that words anchor serve to constrain perceptions. Together, these findings reveal that the object perception framework insufficiently accounts for the nature of emotion perception.

### Special commentary: my perspective on vision and vision rehabilitation [^896171c2]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 10
Ignoring the Mental Model ignores the purpose of vision.

Discussions that assume that our perceptions are based only on the input from the eyes and on feed-forward processing are incomplete. They ignore that the interpretation of images is the most important function of vision. That interpretation requires feedback and is only possible if the retinal input is matched to a second source of information, that is, to concepts stored in memory. It is this interpretation for which the visual system exists. The output of the visual system is not just a collection of snapshots but a continuing meaningful movie that guides our continuing interaction with our environment.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^bd375eb1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that "dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it", explains that "Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning", and concludes, "Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report". It further clarifies, "Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions", and that "Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality".

### Neural representations of events arise from temporal community structure [^79867935]. Nature Neuroscience (2013). Medium credibility.

Our experience of the world seems to divide naturally into discrete, temporally extended events, yet the mechanisms underlying the learning and identification of events are poorly understood. Research on event perception has focused on transient elevations in predictive uncertainty or surprise as the primary signal driving event segmentation. We present human behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence in favor of a different account, in which event representations coalesce around clusters or 'communities' of mutually predicting stimuli. Through parsing behavior, fMRI adaptation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of event representations in a domain containing such community structure, but in which transition probabilities (the basis of uncertainty and surprise) are uniform. We present a computational account of how the relevant representations might arise, proposing a direct connection between event learning and the learning of semantic categories.

### Alcohol intolerance and facial flushing in patients treated with topical tacrolimus… [^9df60a9b]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Local intolerance reactions are a common adverse effect of treatment with tacrolimus ointment. A burning sensation occurs in up to 50% of patients, 1 but symptoms are usually ephemeral and disappear after a few applications. Alaiti et al2 were the first to differentiate facial flushing from the well-recognized burning reaction. The association of facial flushing with alcohol ingestion was later observed in 6% of 316 adult patients in an open study, 3 and in a controlled trial, the phenomenon was recorded in 7% of adult patients treated with 0. 1% tacrolimus ointment.

MF is considered a basic human capacity to attend to sensory experiences, events, perceptions, cognitions, and/or emotions, where it is recommended to observe physical sensations, even painful ones, with a curious and nonjudgmental attitude. MF meditation reduces pain through several brain mechanisms and various pathways such as the changing of attention mechanisms. The major distinguishing feature of all MF‐based management is accepting one's present state and not attempting to directly alter or confront aspects related to headache.

Current research suggests that associations between headache conditions and imbalances in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are due to stress‐related dysregulation in the activity of the parasympathetic–sympathetic branches. In this way, MF meditation has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing pain‐related distress and in enhancing heart rate variability, a vagally mediated marker of ANS balance.

Meditation and relaxation provide meaningful and active management of the headaches that is more successful in relieving pain compared to other techniques such as external secular meditation. As already mentioned, MF reduces the reactivity to distressing thoughts and feelings that accompany pain perception and strengthen the pain; it does not directly improve the frequency of migraine attacks, but improves psychological symptoms and increases parasympathetic activity, which can promote deep muscle relaxation that may reduce pain. That is why it is postulated that MF‐based interventions are a promising option for migraine patients' well‐being at the emotional and cognitive level (EL IV).

MF could be a helpful treatment tool, with considerable impact on quality of life and disability, self‐efficacy, and psychological symptoms. The efficacy of MF‐based interventions has been shown, as they alleviate the suffering in migraine patients and improve their quality of life. However, this does not imply their effectiveness in reducing the number of migraine days per month. This lack of effect on reducing migraine frequency could be the reason it seems to be more effective in patients with episodic rather than chronic migraine.

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^ca62ec64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that targeted perceptual disorders as a consequence of stroke. In the case of cross‐over trials, we analysed data from baseline to the point of cross‐over.

Types of participants

Participants were adults (18 years and older) with impaired perception as a result of a stroke. We used the definition of perception set out in the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (b156): "specific mental functions of recognizing and interpreting sensory stimuli" (World Health Organization 2001). We used this definition because it is internationally recognised, can be applied across all senses, and distinguishes perception from closely related functions, such as sensation and cognition. Following detailed discussion with our stakeholder group, we refined and clarified the scope of the definition to include disorders affecting six areas: hearing (auditory), smell (olfactory), somatosensation (relating to information from the skin, mucous membranes, limbs, and joints; includes proprioception, pressure, and temperature), touch (tactile), taste (gustatory), and vision (visual). Although touch could be considered a component of somatosensation, we chose to present these separately. We considered touch and somatosensation to be separate and distinguishable functions and believed that this would be more accessible to stroke survivors and families, for whom touch is well‐recognised as one of the five "traditional" senses.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^6f4c59af]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea measurement domains — sensory–perceptual experience, affective distress, and symptom impact or burden — are defined and exemplified as follows: sensory–perceptual measures assess what breathing feels like to the patient or research subject and include single item ratings of intensity (e.g. Borg scale, visual analog scale [VAS]) and descriptors of specific sensations; affective distress measures assess how distressing breathing feels with focus that can be immediate (unpleasantness) or evaluative (judgments of meaning or consequences) and include single-item ratings of severity of distress or unpleasantness and multi-item scales of emotional response such as anxiety; symptom impact or burden measures assess how dyspnea/breathlessness affects functional ability, employment (disability), quality of life, or health status, including unidimensional rating of disability or activity limitation (e.g. Medical Research Council [MRC] scale) and multidimensional scales of quality of life/health status. Impact measures, although very important, do not directly assess what breathing feels like; time-frames for sensory–perceptual or affective ratings may be present, immediate past, or short-term recall, whereas impact measures commonly refer to designated intervals or unspecified implicit comparisons and may scale frequency rather than intensity. Instrument reporting should specify what was rated and the direction and verbal anchors (e.g., 0 = none; 10 = most imaginable), and measures should be chosen based on alignment of questionnaire content with the dyspnea aspects most relevant to clinical or research objectives.

### Auditory hallucinations, top-down processing and language perception: a general population study [^2a5a3ff8]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Classical sensory processing theories regard the brain as a device that is purely stimulus driven (Gibson). The brain responds to stimuli in a so-called bottom-up fashion; each percept is generated anew by recombining features from sensory input (Engel et al.). More recent theories suggest that the brain is better understood as an active, adaptive system that engages with input from the sensory systems. A key concept is 'top-down processing', which refers to the idea that perception is guided by expectations based on previous experiences. This idea is a cornerstone of recent Bayesian models of perception (Stocker and Simoncelli). Employing top-down information enables a faster processing of sensory information (Fenske et al; O'Callaghan et al.). The degree to which top-down processing is at play is assumed to be variable. When sensory input is degraded, distorted (e.g. due to limited channel capacity of a communication device) or ambiguous, the expectations created through top-down processes weigh heavier in interpreting the sensory input. Hence, current models propose that a dynamic balance between bottom-up and top-down processing is necessary for accurate perception (Stocker and Simoncelli). This also holds for the perception and interpretation of language: the brain is a 'prediction machine' wherein top-down expectations continuously predict bottom-up information (Van Berkum).

### Being an observer of one's own life-a meta-synthesis on the experience of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units [^6d67a25c]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Perceiving various bodily sensations

Similar to their emotional awareness, patients perceive a variety of physical sensations and are able to consciously differentiate between them. The intensity of the perception varies depending on the medication. However, the origin of the sensation and its localization are determined fairly accurately. Specifically, patients feel warmth or cold in their environment, and they experience pain due to interventions or their position. Patients sense their gastrointestinal tract and know when they need to go to the toilet. They feel that their lungs expand and are ventilated. Patients are also aware of changes caused by medication; they feel sleepy, weak, tired or suppressed. "Well, no, I was not quite under enough. Not to not know anything. I was under it just enough that I knew some things. Well, I guess I remember them going in and out of my mouth, changing the tubes".

Trying to make sense

The patients try to derive explanations from their self-perception under MV and not only experience their situation but also organize and understand it. In this process, they are dependent on information they receive from others and their ability to understand this information. If patients lack information, they refer back to their own knowledge and form hypotheses about what has happened. In addition, they orient themselves to their surroundings and to time, and try to assign their feelings and sensations to situations. One patient stated: "When I woke up, I did not know where I was. First, I thought I slept on the furniture of our home. Gradually, I realized that here is somewhere else. I could not move at all. I thought I had a myocardial infarction because my tongue got numb and I could not talk. I realized that a tube had been put in my mouth".

### What is an auditory object? [^360f9073]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

Objects are the building blocks of experience, but what do we mean by an object? Increasingly, neuroscientists refer to 'auditory objects', yet it is not clear what properties these should possess, how they might be represented in the brain, or how they might relate to the more familiar objects of vision. The concept of an auditory object challenges our understanding of object perception. Here, we offer a critical perspective on the concept and its basis in the brain.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^876e4e57]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

### Experience can change the 'light-from-above' prior [^8d5c51ed]. Nature Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

To interpret complex and ambiguous input, the human visual system uses prior knowledge or assumptions about the world. We show that the 'light-from-above' prior, used to extract information about shape from shading is modified in response to active experience with the scene. The resultant adaptation is not specific to the learned scene but generalizes to a different task, demonstrating that priors are constantly adapted by interactive experience with the environment.

### Call for a framework for reporting evidence for life beyond earth [^6032583b]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our generation could realistically be the one to discover evidence of life beyond Earth. With this privileged potential comes responsibility. The magnitude of the question of whether we are alone in the Universe, and the public interest therein, opens the possibility that results may be taken to imply more than the observations support, or than the observers intend. As life-detection objectives become increasingly prominent in space sciences, it is essential to open a community dialogue about how to convey information in a subject matter that is diverse, complicated and has a high potential to be sensationalized. Establishing best practices for communicating about life detection can serve to set reasonable expectations on the early stages of a hugely challenging endeavour, attach value to incremental steps along the path, and build public trust by making clear that false starts and dead ends are an expected and potentially productive part of the scientific process. Here we endeavour to motivate and seed the discussion with basic considerations and offer an example of how such considerations might be incorporated and applied in a proof-of-concept-level framework. Everything mentioned herein, including the name of the confidence scale, is intended not as a prescription, but simply as the beginning of an important dialogue.

### Molecular mechanisms of nociception [^c7703a66]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The sensation of pain alerts us to real or impending injury and triggers appropriate protective responses. Unfortunately, pain often outlives its usefulness as a warning system and instead becomes chronic and debilitating. This transition to a chronic phase involves changes within the spinal cord and brain, but there is also remarkable modulation where pain messages are initiated - at the level of the primary sensory neuron. Efforts to determine how these neurons detect pain-producing stimuli of a thermal, mechanical or chemical nature have revealed new signalling mechanisms and brought us closer to understanding the molecular events that facilitate transitions from acute to persistent pain.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^7c00cf3b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — major conclusions on mechanisms highlight sensory sources and specific percepts. "A wide range of information arising from numerous sensory afferent sources (Table 2) contributes to multiple sensations of dyspnea (Table 3). Specific physiological processes may be linked to corresponding sensory descriptors, the best characterized of which are sensations of work or effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration". Additional conclusions state, "Sensory–perceptual mechanisms underlying sensations of work or effort and of breathing are similar to those underlying similar sensations in exercising muscle", "Tightness is relatively specific to stimulation of airway receptors in conjunction with bronchoconstriction", and "Intensity of air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration is magnified by imbalances among inspiratory drive, efferent activation (outgoing motor command from the brain), and feedback from afferent receptors throughout the respiratory system".

### Minimal exposure durations reveal visual processing priorities for different stimulus attributes [^6ffca68e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although the human visual system is sensitive to the smallest amounts of light that are physically possible, it is unclear how much visual input the system requires for the extraction of meaningful information. The more sensitive the visual system is to a visual feature, the less exposure to this feature should be required to process it. Measuring the minimal exposures that are required to perceive different stimulus properties can therefore reveal whether the presence of certain features facilitates processing – and whether such facilitation is limited to the feature in question or boosts processing of the stimulus as a whole. Furthermore, minimal exposures can capture the functional and neural distinction between subliminal and supraliminal processing, by comparing the durations required for explicit measures of awareness to those required for objective perceptual judgements and stimulus-evoked neural activity. This can critically inform theories of consciousness, which differ as to whether they propose that awareness arises simultaneously for all aspects of a stimulus. The prominent global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), for example, postulates the concept of 'ignition', whereby once a stimulus reaches the threshold for conscious detection, information about it is shared across the brain. This implies that all stimulus attributes become available to awareness together, predicting a single minimal required exposure for conscious access to all attributes (note that this does not rule out perceptual processing of individual attributes without awareness). In other theoretical formulations (e.g. recurrentand predictiveprocessing, and recent modifications of the GNWT), subjective experience may arise independently for different attributes of the same stimulus; such views can also accommodate the possibility that higher-level processing may occur subliminally, and imply that for any given attribute, the minimal exposures required for detection, identification, and awareness may differ.

### How we feel: ion channel partnerships that detect mechanical inputs and give rise to touch and pain perception [^85b6dd91]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Every moment of every day, our skin and its embedded sensory neurons are bombarded with mechanical cues that we experience as pleasant or painful. Knowing the difference between innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli is critical for survival and relies on the function of mechanoreceptor neurons that vary in their size, shape, and sensitivity. Their function is poorly understood at the molecular level. This review emphasizes the importance of integrating analysis at the molecular and cellular levels and focuses on the discovery of ion channel proteins coexpressed in the mechanoreceptors of worms, flies, and mice.

### Mechanisms of sensory transduction in the skin [^196987f3]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Sensory neurons innervating the skin encode the familiar sensations of temperature, touch and pain. An explosion of progress has revealed unanticipated cellular and molecular complexity in these senses. It is now clear that perception of a single stimulus, such as heat, requires several transduction mechanisms. Conversely, a given protein may contribute to multiple senses, such as heat and touch. Recent studies have also led to the surprising insight that skin cells might transduce temperature and touch. To break the code underlying somatosensation, we must therefore understand how the skin's sensory functions are divided among signalling molecules and cell types.

### Emotional event perception is related to lexical complexity and emotion knowledge [^ead58017]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, for consistency purposes, we have constrained both our sample and the stimuli within the North American cultural and English linguistic context. Future studies may also explore the reliability of the paradigm and generalizability of the current findings with culturally variant samples and stimuli. Moreover, in social settings, people may strategically present emotions different from their actual feelings in the achievement of certain social goals. It is hence also of interest to adapt the Emotion Segmentation Paradigm in examining the nuance between perceiving emotion that others overtly expressed and inferring emotion that others experienced. It may be that perceivers agree on expressed emotions, while showing more variability in consensus around inferred felt emotions, for example.

Our exploratory analysis using signal detection metrics demonstrated a positive link between active emotion vocabulary and a liberal criterion for pausing videos. To probe the link between emotion vocabulary and sensitivity to emotion events, future research could use a more classic detection task where the events (and foils) are paused for the participant.

Our paradigm can be further extended to examine emotion segmentation in clinical populations. For example, past research suggests that individuals with depression have a bias toward content of negative valence, which may lead to different perceptual attentionand interpretation, of emotional stimuli. Future research with depressed samples could distinguish between normatively positive, negative, and ambiguous emotional events, which would allow for more precision in measuring what is driving departures from consensus. Furthermore, the current study has focused on the differentiation of others' emotion, rather than one's own emotional experience, which may account for the non-significant correlation between the TAS-20 score and emotion segmentation performance. Future research may apply the paradigm with instructed focus on one's own emotional experience instead of that of the others.

The Emotion Segmentation Paradigm can also be expanded in future work to more explicitly examine a broader range of labeling behaviors beyond the use of emotion labels. A long-standing observation is that individuals label emotional targets with a range of terms including antecedent conditions and action tendencies, which can be considered constitutive aspects of emotional events. As a result, our focus on emotion labels may underestimate consensus on emotional meanings. Further, cultural groups vary in the tendency to describe emotions using action verbs, bodily state descriptions and mental states descriptions. The Emotion Segmentation Paradigm would be a beneficial framework for examining whether these different ways of making meaning (e.g. emotion labels versus action tendencies) impact the grain and relative timing of emotion segmentations.

### From cue to meaning: brain mechanisms supporting the construction of expectations of pain [^44423584]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The brain mechanisms by which sensory cues become transformed into expectations of impending events are a critical component of cognitive tuning of sensory processing. However, distinctions among the afferent processing of cue-related activity itself versus those mechanisms supporting the contextual meaning imparted to the cue remain limited. Do sensory cues with equal meaning engage similar patterns of brain activations even if they are delivered in separate modalities? To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging of an expectation paradigm in which cues were delivered with visual or innocuous thermal stimuli. Cues were designed to be highly meaningful because they predicted the delivery of high and low painful stimuli. As expected, the cues themselves activated unimodal sensory cortices. This cue modality-specific activation was transformed into a pattern of activity reflecting cue meaning. Cues signaling high pain produced greater activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Such activity is consistent with the graded encoding of the magnitude of expected pain. In contrast, cues signaling low pain produced greater activity in the right intraparietal sulcus. This activation may reflect processes directing spatial attention to the stimulated body region in order to more accurately evaluate the relatively weak, low pain stimulus. Taken together, these findings indicate that cues arising from different sensory modalities ultimately engage common brain mechanisms that reflect the meaning of the cue. This meaning-related activity is presumably critical for preparing sensory systems to optimally process afferent information.

### Age-associated changes in multimodal pain perception [^52486a20]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The somatosensory system, which includes the perceptions of tactile, temperature, pressure, and pain as detected through a wide range of sensory receptors, provides us with critical information about our internal and external environments. Pain in particular is a significant alert, warning us of potential problems, damage or dangerous situations. Somatosensory stimuli such as heat, cold and pressure can further arouse our perception of physical pain as their intensity increases.

Ageing is a natural process during which human experience declines in their somatosensory systems, and a change in pain experience is one typical effect of ageing. Somatosensory declines tend to make individuals more susceptible to injury, suggesting age-related decreases in pain sensitivity. Previous studies have shown a sensory threshold increase in older adults. However, few studies have distinguished between the degeneration processes of the different somatosensory types. Furthermore, findings regarding age-related changes in pain perception have been inconsistent due to the use of differing pain induction methods, as pain sensitivities vary according to stimulation type (e.g. increasing pressure pain versus unchanged heat pain).

Changes in pain perception due to ageing could be related to different somatosensory sensations. Multimodal somatosensation relies on different types of conductive fibres. Peripheral nerve fibres contain both small and large fibres, both of which detect sensations in the skin and carry their respective signals to the central nervous system. Small fibres (e.g. C, Aδ fibres) respond mainly to external thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimulations, while tactile and pressure sensations on the skin are often related to large fibres (e.g. Aβ fibre). Damage to the fibres can cause neuropathies characterised by positive or negative symptoms related to sensation (e.g. neuropathic pain, sensory loss). Thermal stimulation and pressure can activate small (Aδ and C) and large (Aβ) fibres separately; therefore, these stimuli are often used to detect fibre damage.

### "We live as good a life as we can, in the situation we' re in"-the significance of the home as perceived by persons with dementia [^177c6d0d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Especially vulnerable are persons with dementia living alone, who have been shown to experience a sense of losing time and living in a vague existence, followed by loneliness and forgetfulness. A meta-synthesis on quality of life among persons with dementia found sense of place, understood as experiencing a meaningful attachment to the current environment, to be a critical concept.

A distinction between being at home physically and being at home emotionally or existentially is common in the literature on dementia and in health and care sciences in general. In this literature, there is also an understanding of being at home as a progressive process. Care philosopher Kari Martinsen makes a distinction between inhabiting and dwelling, understood as the difference between being physically present in ones' home and 'being' at home, in the existential sense. Building upon phenomenological philosophy, Martinsen's writings on the home maintain the idea that being at home, understood as dwelling, is a fundamental way of being in the world and interpreting life. Dwelling is founded upon a sensation of being free, secure, and at peace. It implies taking care of and preserving one's home, its surroundings and the other dwellers of the house. Furthermore, it means to form the rhythms of one's habits in interaction with others and with the constraints of the house and its environs. Drawing further on the metaphor of rhythms, Martinsen claims that a home has a tone and a song. The task of the health care professional, according to Martinsen, is to find this tone, attune to it, and help maintain the harmony of the home.

The growing literature on the experiences of home-dwelling persons with dementia reveals increasing complexity and variety, calling for more individualized approaches in dementia care. Although qualities of the home have been identified, there is still sparse knowledge on how this varies between individuals. By letting empirical data go into dialogue with theory on the home in a perspective of care philosophy, the study further aimed to provide principles for health care personnel within dementia care. The study addresses the following research questions: (1) How do persons with dementia describe the meaning of home? (2) How do persons with dementia describe their perceptions of living at home – in the present, and in the future?

### Altered processing of self-produced sensations in psychosis at cortical and spinal levels [^a83e31ff]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychosis is often characterized by disturbances in the sense of self, with patients frequently misattributing self-produced sensations to external sources. While somatic hallucinations and misperceptions are common, the underlying disruptions in basic bodily self-processing remain unclear. We aimed to investigate processing of self-evoked sensations, including touch and interoception, in psychosis using a multimodal, multi-method approach. This case-control-study included a total of 70 participants (35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders, 35 age- and sex-matched controls). Participants performed self-/other-touch-tasks and interoceptive assessments during functional MRI, evoked potentials measurements, and/or behavioral and psychophysical tests. Primary outcomes included neural and behavioral responses to self- and externally-generated sensations (touch and heartbeat). Brain activation, spinal evoked responses, heartbeat perception and processing (evoked responses), and behavioral measures were analyzed, with preregistered hypotheses. Patients demonstrated heightened right superior temporal gyrus activation during self-touch. Tactile self-other distinction impairments were evident at the spinal cord level. Behaviorally, patients showed reduced differentiation in tactile thresholds for self- vs. other-touch. Interoceptive impairments included diminished cortical responses to heartbeat signals, lower interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), and reduced self-reported interoceptive sensitivity. These findings reveal pervasive sensory and self-related disturbances in psychotic disorders. Impairments in differentiating self- and externally-evoked responses, detectable as early as the spinal cord level, may contribute to higher-order symptoms of psychosis.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^dee4b819]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Neurophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea — sensory sources and qualities: The report notes that dyspnea involves multiple distinguishable sensations and likely arises from different sensory mechanisms, stating, "Dyspnea comprises several different uncomfortable respiratory sensations that are distinct in the sense that subjects describe them differently, and they can be varied independently with physiological interventions. Thus, we infer that they arise from different sensory mechanisms". Beyond peripheral afferents, central motor signals also inform perception: "In addition to traditionally defined sensory afferents, information on the state of respiration is available from respiratory motor areas of the brain, which can send an ascending copy of their descending motor activity to perceptual areas (corollary discharge)", and "The respiratory motor system, however, is unusual in having both automatic (brainstem) and voluntary (cortical) sources of motor command; corollary discharge from these different sources probably gives rise to different sensations".

### Thermal contrast enhancement predicts paradoxical heat sensation [^93f5dfd9]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among the various thermal sensations experienced by humans, Paradoxical Heat Sensation (PHS) stands out as a particularly intriguing phenomenon –. PHS refers to the illusory perception of warmth during the cooling of the skin and is typically perceived when warming and cooling are temporally alternated. It is during these dynamic thermal alternations that the human thermosensory system misinterprets a temperature change from warm to cool as warmth, heat or heat pain. Despite previous research efforts, the underlying mechanisms of this counterintuitive sensory experience have remained elusive. Clarifying these mechanisms is essential not only for advancing our understanding of PHS but also for uncovering the broader principles that govern human thermosensory perception.

Here, we demonstrate that PHS reflects a temporal contrast enhancement mechanism in the human thermosensory system. We propose that the dynamic interplay between subsequent warming and cooling on the skin elicits neural responses that amplify the perceived difference between these temperature sensations, culminating in the paradoxical experience of heat. Contrast enhancement refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between two contrasting features (for example, light and dark bars) are perceptually enhanced. This mechanism is fundamental for improving the sensitivity and discriminability of sensory information across various perceptual domains, including vision and audition. In the visual domain, for instance, differences in luminance between spatially adjacent stimuli are accentuated by the nervous system to more effectively detect and process features of the sensory environment, such as boundaries or edges. Visual gratings, which consist of spatial patterns of alternating light and dark bars, provide a clear example of this principle (Fig. 1A).

### A new perceptual illusion reveals mechanisms of sensory decoding [^df171587]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Perceptual illusions are usually thought to arise from the way sensory signals are encoded by the brain, and indeed are often used to infer the mechanisms of sensory encoding. But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information, reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary, and observers seem to use signals from these 'displaced' neurons to optimize their performance. We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers' perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies, the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded.

### Empirically integrating the evidence for different predictive coding components using auditory false perception [^f68b0c3c]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Perception is a probabilistic estimation of the sensory information we receive at any given time and is shaped by an internal model generated by the brain by assimilating information over the life course. This predictive system in the brain has several components-(i) the internal model, (ii) the model-based prediction called priors, (iii) the weighted difference between the prior and sensory input called prediction error (PE) and (iv) the weighted sum of the prior and input called perceptual inference. Until now, different studies have explored the independent components of this predictive coding system, and we, for the first time to our knowledge, integrate them. To do this, we induce a conditioned hallucination (CH) illusion by means of a multisensory integration paradigm and use this as a model to study the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to this experience. Additionally, we also probe their predictive coding system using a well-established local-global auditory oddball paradigm. By comparing the behavioral and electrophysiological components of people more and less likely to perceive an illusion in the two paradigms, we observed that high perceivers place more confidence in their internal model and low perceivers in the sensory information. Furthermore, high perceivers were more sensitive than low perceivers to PEs that were generated by a change in the context of the sensory information, which served as a measure of a change in the internal model itself. As an exploratory analysis, we also observed that the objective likelihood of perceiving an illusion was corrected to the self-reported likelihood of perceiving an illusion in a day-to-day setting, which disappears when controlled for the perceptual threshold. These results taken together start to give us an idea as to how a person's innate bias-either towards a learned model or external information may-affect their perception in a sensory context.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^583a94fd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) phenotype in children includes hidden or poorly articulated symptoms and heterogeneous symptom expressions. Children with OCD may display compulsions without well-defined obsessions and rituals other than the typical washing or checking, and children's obsessions often center on a fear of a catastrophic family event. Neither gender nor age at onset has been reported to determine the type, number, or severity of OCD symptoms. OCD symptoms tend to wax and wane and are persistent in most patients, changing over time so that the presenting symptom constellation is not maintained. The Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale measures the presence and severity of OC symptoms within several distinct dimensions that combine thematically related obsessions and compulsions. Early-onset cases have a high frequency of "sensory phenomena" preceding or accompanying compulsions, including localized tactile and musculoskeletal sensations and mental sensations such as "just-right" perceptions and "incompleteness".

### Moment-by-moment tracking of naturalistic learning and its underlying hippocampo-cortical interactions [^e9b1c797]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans can learn very quickly. When meaningful content is presented in narrative form, we are able to absorb a substantial amount of information in one shot, that is without repetition or rehearsal. Consequently, when we listen to a story that we have heard before, we can often recall what is about to happen from memory.

This kind of naturalistic learning has recently received more attention in the investigation of our memory system. Naturalistic stimuli engage the brain to a stronger extent than sparse and artificial stimuliand allow us to study how memory is used "in the wild", outside of situations where our memory is explicitly being tested. Studying memory in naturalistic settings has also exposed some fundamental theoretical questions that were previously ignored: When participants are given an artificial memory test (e.g. a list of word pairs), it is easy to say when memories should be stored and retrieved (they should be stored during the "study phase" and retrieved during the "test phase"), but the real world is not conveniently divided up into "study phases" and "test phases" — there is just continuous experience, and the field of memory research is just beginning to grapple with the question of when encoding and retrieval take place in the wild. Recent work in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience has started to shed light on these issues. Cognitive psychology has focused on the role of pre-existing knowledge about how situations unfold, so-called schemata, in structuring our continuous experience into discrete events (e.g. a dinner or a phone call). Theories of event segmentation have productively explored how people automatically and spontaneously segment experience into events: The core postulate of these theories is that we use event models to make predictions about the future (e.g. we anticipate the bill when having dinner at a restaurant); when the current event model ceases to generate accurate predictions, we swap out the current event model for a new one and perceive an event boundary. Importantly, these theories treat event boundaries as a unified psychological construct, where the defining feature is a discontinuity in which event representations are active, rather than the presence of any specific high- or low-level perceptual feature –. This unified view of event segmentation has been instantiated in computational models that can explain a wide range of findings. The perceived boundaries between events can be measured through self-report; this approach to marking event boundaries has previously been used to identify a large number of robust behavioral and neural correlates of event boundaries.

Introduction

Introspection tells us that a given sensory event may be experienced differently at different times, even if the physical input is replicated. This lack of constancy can be studied in the laboratory, where the identical physical input can yield different perceptual judgments across the extended sequence of trials typical of a controlled experiment. Paralleling the variability in subjective estimation and decision making, variability in the face of an unchanging physical input is also found in neuronal responses at all levels of the sensory pathway and at all levels of resolution, from single neurons to EEG –.

Some studies have been able to link the variability in the judgment of physical input to the sequence of preceding trials — the trial history –. But trial history is itself complex and multifactorial, for it consists of previous stimuli, previous choices (expressed as actions), and previous outcomes (rewards, collected or lost). Recent literature has focused on dissociating the effect of past stimuli from the effect of the subject's own past choices –. When compared directly within the same experiment, the most recent choice (on trial n − 1) is found to exert an attractive effect on the current choice (trial n); that is, choices tend to be repeated. This phenomenon has been argued to reflect high-level decisional processes. By contrast, the most recent stimulus (trial n − 1) is found to exert a repulsive effect on the next reported percept (trial n). For instance, a vertical line or grating is judged as slightly tilted to the left if the previously viewed one was tilted to the right. Perceptual repulsion has been argued to originate before the stage of decision making, being consistent with the phenomenon of sensory adaptation seen at many levels of the ascending sensory pathways, and occurs retinotopicallyand independently of the requirements of the task. Since even passive exposure to sensory input can cause a repulsive bias in the subsequent perceptual judgment, and since the repulsive effect in trial n has been observed mostly after brief intervals (even below 1 s), neuronal short-term adaptation has been proposed as a mechanism.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^6cf39fd2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation and management principles — assessment "continues to be dependent on a thorough history and physical examination", and no single test universally tracks dyspnea because "no diagnostic test or biomarker correlates closely with changes in dyspnea across all conditions or settings", though "specific tests (e.g., spirometry or peak flow, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], arterial blood gases) have diagnostic utility in specific clinical settings or circumstances". Initial treatment prioritizes the underlying cause as "the first priority", after which "the clinician should direct attention to persistent physiological derangements amenable to intervention (e.g., hypoxemia, acidemia)". For chronic exertional dyspnea, "the contribution of cardiovascular deconditioning… should be investigated and pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise training considered for patients with long-standing dyspnea and reduced functional capacity". Measurement is emphasized, as "dyspnea can and should be measured", and instruments "should be classified as addressing domains of sensory-perceptual experience, affective distress, or symptom/disease impact or burden", with a call that "clinicians and investigators should be more explicit about the domains being measured". Finally, adjunct approaches "targeted at altering afferent sensory information… or central processing… demand further investigation".

### Discriminative and affective touch: sensing and feeling [^c48ef643]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

The multimodal properties of the human somatosensory system continue to be unravelled. There is mounting evidence that one of these submodalities-touch-has another dimension, providing not only its well-recognized discriminative input to the brain, but also an affective input. It has long been recognized that touch plays an important role in many forms of social communication and a number of theories have been proposed to explain observations and beliefs about the "power of touch". Here, we propose that a class of low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers that innervate the hairy skin represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch.

### Lesions of the human amygdala impair enhanced perception of emotionally salient events [^ef9cd473]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Commensurate with the importance of rapidly and efficiently evaluating motivationally significant stimuli, humans are probably endowed with distinct faculties and maintain specialized neural structures to enhance their detection. Here we consider that a critical function of the human amygdala is to enhance the perception of stimuli that have emotional significance. Under conditions of limited attention for normal perceptual awareness-that is, the attentional blink-we show that healthy observers demonstrate robust benefits for the perception of verbal stimuli of aversive content compared with stimuli of neutral content. In contrast, a patient with bilateral amygdala damage has no enhanced perception for such aversive stimulus events. Examination of patients with either left or right amygdala resections shows that the enhanced perception of aversive words depends specifically on the left amygdala. All patients comprehend normally the affective meaning of the stimulus events, despite the lack of evidence for enhanced perceptual encoding of these events in patients with left amygdala lesions. Our results reveal a neural substrate for affective influences on perception, indicating that similar neural mechanisms may underlie the affective modulation of both recollective and perceptual experience.

### The sensory neurons of touch [^63b88cb8]. Neuron (2013). Low credibility.

The somatosensory system decodes a wide range of tactile stimuli and thus endows us with a remarkable capacity for object recognition, texture discrimination, sensory-motor feedback and social exchange. The first step leading to perception of innocuous touch is activation of cutaneous sensory neurons called low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs). Here, we review the properties and functions of LTMRs, emphasizing the unique tuning properties of LTMR subtypes and the organizational logic of their peripheral and central axonal projections. We discuss the spinal cord neurophysiological representation of complex mechanical forces acting upon the skin and current views of how tactile information is processed and conveyed from the spinal cord to the brain. An integrative model in which ensembles of impulses arising from physiologically distinct LTMRs are integrated and processed in somatotopically aligned mechanosensory columns of the spinal cord dorsal horn underlies the nervous system's enormous capacity for perceiving the richness of the tactile world.

### The relationships between depression, inflammation and self-reported disease activity in IBD and their impact on healthcare usage [^d5aba725]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, given the heterogeneity of IBD, it may be that depression has different gut-brain implications between individuals, based on environmental, genetic, pharmacological or behavioural differences. Therefore, the eligibility criterion of those with symptom burden with a greater impact on quality of life may have led to overrepresentation of people whose depression and related psychological factors have a larger influence on symptom perception. This may preclude the inclusion of individuals with greater vulnerability to bidirectional neuroinflammatory pathways where depression and gut inflammation have stronger associations, irrespective of symptoms. Future research should attempt to use representative samples and stratify people living with IBD into different 'gut-brain' profiles to assess individual differences in gut-brain mechanisms.

Furthermore, the recruitment strategy selecting patients where symptoms have high impact on quality of life may have influenced our findings that SRDA weakly correlated with objective inflammatory disease activity, even when differential relationships of inflammation and SRDA between disease subtypes were investigated. However, this finding is strongly corroborated by other studies, where self-reported measures of symptoms are more strongly associated with psychological factors, including depression, than objective inflammatory disease markers. Many neurobiological and cognitive processes may underly the relationship between depression and symptoms. Psychological factors may perpetuate or exacerbate symptom perception and reporting, potentially contributing to the high symptom burden, despite low levels of inflammation. For instance, in IBD, illness perceptions, stress, anxiety and depression are routinely associated with IBD symptom reports, disability and health-related quality of life. Specific cognitive biases that may contribute to symptoms in the absence of inflammation include (i) somatic hypervigilance, whereby excessive focus on bodily sensations predisposes patients to misinterpret sensations as meaningful symptoms; (ii) confirmation bias, where prior experiences prime patients to attribute mild symptoms to be more severe, overlooking alternative explanations; and (iii) catastrophising, a cognitive distortion where patients anticipate the worst outcome from their symptoms which can increase symptom perception.

### Dynamics of history-dependent perceptual judgment [^5f503372]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Identical physical inputs do not always evoke identical percepts. To investigate the role of stimulus history in tactile perception, we designed a task in which rats had to judge each vibrissal vibration, in a long series, as strong or weak depending on its mean speed. After a low-speed stimulus (trial n − 1), rats were more likely to report the next stimulus (trial n) as strong, and after a high-speed stimulus, they were more likely to report the next stimulus as weak, a repulsive effect that did not depend on choice or reward on trial n − 1. This effect could be tracked over several preceding trials (i.e. n − 2 and earlier) and was characterized by an exponential decay function, reflecting a trial-by-trial incorporation of sensory history. Surprisingly, the influence of trial n − 1 strengthened as the time interval between n − 1 and n grew. Human subjects receiving fingertip vibrations showed these same key findings. We are able to account for the repulsive stimulus history effect, and its detailed time scale, through a single-parameter model, wherein each new stimulus gradually updates the subject's decision criterion. This model points to mechanisms underlying how the past affects the ongoing subjective experience.

### Definition of senses-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^a6fec4b8]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

sensesListen to pronunciationIn medicine, the ways in which the body receives signals from the environment. The five human senses are sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The body receives signals through the sense organs. These organs have special nerves that send signals to the brain. The brain processes these signals and then sends information back to the rest of the body to tell it how to respond to the signal. Aging, certain diseases or conditions, and some types of medicines or treatments can affect the senses.

### The dark bridal canopy [^108edb72]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Physician narratives in family medicine have the potential to convey the vibrant spirit of our field and provide meaningful insights into disease, illness, suffering, and the nature of healing. They may also complement empirical research, education, and practice through their integrative, expressive nature. This true story depicts a challenge faced by the author while serving as a family physician in a desolate, desert region in Israel's southern Aravah Valley (south of the Dead Sea), where he was privileged to practice for a decade. The episode, a fatal car crash in which a newlywed Druse woman (a member of a secretive sect) was killed, involved much more than just the terse details listed in the emergency log. An example of a family medicine physician-and-self drama, this piece takes the reader beyond the basic medical facts into the experience and sensations of the event. It also provides a stark contrast to the usual medical description and emphasizes the importance of stories as reflective opportunities for improving health care, sustaining ourselves as practitioners, and maintaining the vitality of our field.

### Pathophysiology of somatosensory abnormalities in parkinson disease [^35498e15]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Changes in sensory function that have been described in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) can be either 'pure' disorders of conscious perception such as elevations in sensory threshold, or disorders of sensorimotor integration, in which the interaction between sensory input and motor output is altered. In this article, we review the extensive evidence for disrupted tactile, nociceptive, thermal and proprioceptive sensations in PD, as well as the influences exerted on these sensations by dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation. We argue that abnormal spatial and temporal processing of sensory information produces incorrect signals for the preparation and execution of voluntary movement. Sensory deficits are likely to be a consequence of the dopaminergic denervation of the basal ganglia that is the hallmark of PD. A possible mechanism to account for somatosensory deficits is one in which disease-related dopaminergic denervation leads to a loss of response specificity, resulting in transmission of noisier and less-differentiated information to cortical regions. Changes in pain perception might have a different explanation, possibly involving disease-related effects outside the basal ganglia, including involvement of peripheral pain receptors, as well as structures such as the periaqueductal grey matter and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) — principles and interpretation: QST systems "have been developed to assess and quantify sensory function" in neurologic patients and "measures the detection threshold of accurately calibrated sensory stimuli", often using "vibratory, thermal, or pain stimuli" tied to discrete pathways; tests are "psychophysical in nature, requiring cooperation", because the response is the subject's report; abnormal results "may signal dysfunction anywhere along the sensory pathway", psychological factors "figure prominently", and QST differs from nerve conduction and evoked potentials, which generate an evoked response "generally independent of cooperation from the subject".

### Primary sensory cortices contain distinguishable spatial patterns of activity for each sense [^ce6c3f6a]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Whether primary sensory cortices are essentially multisensory or whether they respond to only one sense is an emerging debate in neuroscience. Here we use a multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data in humans to demonstrate that simple and isolated stimuli of one sense elicit distinguishable spatial patterns of neuronal responses, not only in their corresponding primary sensory cortex, but in other primary sensory cortices. These results indicate that primary sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as unisensory, contain unique signatures of other senses and, thereby, prompt a reconsideration of how sensory information is coded in the human brain.

### Sensation, movement and learning in the absence of barrel cortex [^73c4cc9d]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

For many of our senses, the role of the cerebral cortex in detecting stimuli is controversial 1–17. Here we examine the effects of both acute and chronic inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex in mice trained to move their large facial whiskers to detect an object by touch and respond with a lever to obtain a water reward. Using transgenic mice, we expressed inhibitory opsins in excitatory cortical neurons. Transient optogenetic inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex, as well as permanent lesions, initially produced both movement and sensory deficits that impaired detection behaviour, demonstrating the link between sensory and motor systems during active sensing. Unexpectedly, lesioned mice had recovered full behavioural capabilities by the subsequent session. This rapid recovery was experience-dependent, and early re-exposure to the task after lesioning facilitated recovery. Furthermore, ablation of the primary somatosensory cortex before learning did not affect task acquisition. This combined optogenetic and lesion approach suggests that manipulations of the sensory cortex may be only temporarily disruptive to other brain structures that are themselves capable of coordinating multiple, arbitrary movements with sensation. Thus, the somatosensory cortex may be dispensable for active detection of objects in the environment.

### Sniffing out meaning: chemosensory and semantic neural network changes in sommeliers [^b243c9fc]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

In the current study, functional (activation and connectivity) differences between groups may reflect cognitive mechanisms underpinning sommeliers' experience in wine tasting. An alternative interpretation concerns experiential (perceptual) differences between sommeliers and nonexperts. The observed neural differences between groups could represent significant differences in how each group perceived the wines they tasted (Masaoka et al.). In the same vein, the correlation between regional activity and wine complexity in sommeliers may reflect the fact that more complex wines produce richer perceptual experiences in experts. Prior evidence suggests that the perceptual representations of wine experts and novices are similar (Chollet & Valentin,), and that any differences in perception are less pronounced than differences in cognition (flavor labeling, schematization, and typicality judgments [Hughson & Boakes,]). That is, greater experience is associated with the ability to describe a perceptual representation rather than a change in the representation itself. This difference in descriptive ability can be observed in the tendency for wine novices to use concrete descriptors over abstract ones when attempting to differentiate wines (Gawel). It is also possible that experience may alter perceptual experiences. Extensive prior experience with a wine varietal or regional style can produce a representative sensory concept of a specific wine type that is shared among experts (Ballester et al.). During tastings, this information may be used to increase salience for prototypical characteristics to increase the chance of detecting components indicative of a certain wine type (Gawel). However, it is unclear whether this would constitute a change in a perceptual representation itself rather than a heightened awareness of an aspect of the original representation.

### Interpretative phenomenological analysis and genetic counseling [^a1c713f3]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of qualitative methods in healthcare research has gained acceptance over the last 30years, and there are now a number of well-established approaches available offering a diversity of aims, procedures, and epistemological emphases. This paper focuses on one such approach, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), to provide a discussion and critical overview of its current and future utility for genetic-counseling research. First, the phenomenological and hermeneutic (interpretative) underpinnings of IPA, as well as its methodological commitments to inductive, idiographic, and interrogative working, are considered in the wider contexts of genetic and genomic science, and psychotherapy and counseling research. Then, research using IPA with more direct relevance for genetic counseling is considered in greater depth. This corpus includes those studies that speak to the most frequently endorsed activities of genetic counselors and pass quality evaluations specific to IPA. The literature is organized into three areas: (1) perceptions of genetic risk, (2) how genetic information, such as a diagnosis, personal test, or family history, is understood, and (3) the activity and experience of genetic counseling. Studies concerning perception of risk suggest it is experienced like presence on a radar, becoming more or less prominent or further or nearer from an individual's sense of themselves and their life. Studies concerning the understanding of genetic information imply the importance of multiple contexts in shaping understandings, but also that genetic information can shape experiences of other aspects of life and therefore that contexts may themselves be fluid. IPA used to consider experiences of genetic counseling suggests the importance of expertise in managing uncertainty and the centrality of sense-making in the process for both counselor and counselee. Concluding remarks involve current and future compatibility between IPA and genetic counseling and the call for continuation of what is suggested to be a mutually beneficial dialogue between the two.

### Impact of haptic feedback on applied intracorporeal forces using a novel surgical robotic system-a randomized cross-over study with novices in an experimental setup [^3574ac1a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

"True haptic perception"

With this term we describe force feedback without changing the somatosensory modality. The opposite could be pseudo-haptic feedback, where visual and tactile vibrations are transmitted to symbolize grasping forces between the instrument jaws. To differentiate the sensor channels, we take a closer look at the tactile sense when describing a passive recognizing process of several different tactile stimuli. It includes static proprioception (spatial awareness), visceroception (visceral signaling), nociception (perception of pain), thermoception (perception of temperature differences), and surface sensitivity (perception of mechanical irritations such as compression, vibration, and elongation). Some tactile sensations are perceived with direct conjunction to kinaesthetic receptors. The combination of passive tactile feedback (tissue perception) and dynamic kinaesthetic feedback (motion perception, as part of proprioception) is considered haptic feedback. Consequently, haptics generally stands for an active procedure of exploration and requires interaction with an object. It can be synonymously described as a "tentative understanding". For the interpretation of all sensory information, we make use of different exploratory procedures: unsupported holding, enclosure, applied pressure, lateral motion, and contour following. The pursued object properties to be determined by a surgeon are mainly size, surface, and material characteristics as well as position.

### Stable perception of visually ambiguous patterns [^a42fc4ee]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

During the viewing of certain patterns, widely known as ambiguous or puzzle figures, perception lapses into a sequence of spontaneous alternations, switching every few seconds between two or more visual interpretations of the stimulus. Although their nature and origin remain topics of debate, these stochastic switches are generally thought to be the automatic and inevitable consequence of viewing a pattern without a unique solution. We report here that in humans such perceptual alternations can be slowed, and even brought to a standstill, if the visual stimulus is periodically removed from view. We also show, with a visual illusion, that this stabilizing effect hinges on perceptual disappearance rather than on actual removal of the stimulus. These findings indicate that uninterrupted subjective perception of an ambiguous pattern is required for the initiation of the brain-state changes underlying multistable vision.

### All in a sniff: olfaction as a model for active sensing [^935d4d0b]. Neuron (2011). Low credibility.

Sensation is an active process involving the sampling and central processing of external stimuli selectively in space and time. Olfaction in particular depends strongly on active sensing due to the fact that-at least in mammals-inhalation of air into the nasal cavity is required for odor detection. This seemingly simple first step in odor sensation profoundly shapes nearly all aspects of olfactory system function, from the distribution of odorant receptors to the functional organization of central processing to the perception of odors. The dependence of olfaction on inhalation also allows for profound modulation of olfactory processing by changes in odor sampling strategies in coordination with attentional state and sensory demands. This review discusses the role of active sensing in shaping olfactory system function at multiple levels and draws parallels with other sensory modalities to highlight the importance of an active sensing perspective in understanding how sensory systems work in the behaving animal.

### COVID-19 and the chemical senses: supporting players take center stage [^c17c17af]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

The main neurological manifestation of COVID-19 is loss of smell or taste. The high incidence of smell loss without significant rhinorrhea or nasal congestion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 targets the chemical senses through mechanisms distinct from those used by endemic coronaviruses or other common cold-causing agents. Here we review recently developed hypotheses about how SARS-CoV-2 might alter the cells and circuits involved in chemosensory processing and thereby change perception. Given our limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we propose future experiments to elucidate disease mechanisms and highlight the relevance of this ongoing work to understanding how the virus might alter brain function more broadly.

### Introspective inference counteracts perceptual distortion [^527ed1ca]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of a formal explanatory framework and experimental paradigms suitable to study reality testing. Previous work related to reality testing has broadly used two main approaches: (1) source (self versus other) memory tasks in the context of semantic association and sentence completion; and, more recently, (2) imagery tasks in the context of perceptual decision-making –. The first approach relies on episodic memory and does not capture in-the-moment reality testing; the second approach captures in-the-moment processes and leverages signal-detection theory but relies on individuals' imagery ability, thus limiting experimental control and translatability. Furthermore, while imagery is relevant to some forms of reality testing, reality testing is a broader construct, and its impairments need not involve altered imagery. Here, we focus on a form of reality testing that we refer to as 'perceptual insight': the in-the-moment process of incorporating introspective knowledge about distortions in internal percepts to effectively infer the actual state of the external world. We propose a formal model of perceptual insight building on Bayesian theory and present a perceptual-insight paradigm that minimizes memory confounds and enhances experimental control over previous designs.

In this work, we reasoned that probing perceptual insight would first require experimentally inducing a sufficiently strong perceptual distortion — a discrepancy between an objective stimulus feature and its subjective perceptual experience or estimate — and then probing beliefs about the true state of varying objective stimuli. To do this, we used the motion after-effect (MAE), a well-characterized class of illusions that includes strong illusory percepts of (seemingly veridical) complex motion induced by prolonged viewing of an adaptor motion stimulus. We deemed the complex MAE particularly suitable for studying perceptual insight because explicit knowledge about the illusion seemed to allow accurate inferences on the actual state of objective stimuli while their subjective experience was distorted. Augmenting classic MAE methods with psychophysics tools, computational modeling, and pupillometry, we thus set out to validate an explanatory framework for human perceptual insight.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^73019a80]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Human perception has often been shown to be based on a Bayesian inference process, in which the brain infers information about the environment by integrating incoming information with previous beliefs. Computationally, this involves the integration of a prior distribution ("prior") with a likelihood distribution ("likelihood") to give a posterior distribution ("posterior"), which then forms the basis of a belief or percept. Many studies have shown evidence supporting the idea that perception and decision-making can be explained as Bayesian inference –. Further, confidence, i.e. the sense of certainty that typically accompanies perceptual decisions, can also be explained by Bayesian inference models.

In formal terms, Bayesian models propose that confidence corresponds to the perceived posterior probability of being correct about our inferences, based on the relative strengths of the posterior probabilities of each hypothesis being considered. This Bayesian confidence model has been highly influential, and it has been tested and supported empirically in both animals and humans –, though alternatives have been proposed –. Importantly, this framework considers that the posterior percept is based on the precision-weighted integration of priors and likelihoods, and also that this same posterior gives rise to decisions and confidence. This simple formulation relies on two assumptions: first, that both decisions and confidence integrate priors and likelihoods optimally; and further, that confidence integrates priors and likelihoods in the same way as decisions. But these assumptions must be empirically tested, as the alternative is also possible: either confidence, decisions, or both, might integrate priors in systematically biased ways, and might do so asymmetrically.

### A flexible readout mechanism of human sensory representations [^4fadd8e3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans can flexibly attend to different aspects of the environment when their goals require it. This can be operationalized by asking human observers to report about one feature of a visual stimulus while ignoring other features. Such context-dependent judgments could be supported by a cortical implementation which increases sensitivity or selectivity for the sensory representations of reported features while suppressing others. A second and potentially complimentary implementation is to maintain stable sensory representations while flexibly changing the downstream readout of these.

A great deal of evidence exists for the former possibility of changing representations to accommodate behavioral demands. Behavioral manipulations of spatial attention –, feature-based attention –, and stimulus expectations, all have been associated with changes in sensory representations. These changes may occur very early in the visual hierarchyand take the form of changes in sensitivity, shifts in feature selectivity. increases in baseline response – useful for efficient selection, and changes in the structure of stimulus-driven and noise correlations.

However, flexible readout rather than change in sensory representation can be a behaviorally advantageous implementation of task demands. Although changing sensory representations can be beneficial, there can be associated behavioral costs to suppressing ignored features – when these are actually relevant to behavior. In many dramatic demonstrations, observers have been made blind to salient events when reporting about other aspects of a visual scene. This suggests a potential advantage to maintaining stable sensory representations and using flexible sensory readouts to enable adaptable behavior –.

To establish that a change in sensory representation between different task conditions is large enough to explain perceptual behavior, we can turn to linking models. Quantitative linking models,– connect measurements of cortical activity to behavior by modeling the presumed process by which sensory activity gives rise to perceptual behavior. Such linking models are explicit hypotheses and can be falsified if they are unable to quantitatively link change in sensory representations to behavior across different task conditions.

### Schizotypal traits and anomalous perceptual experiences are associated with greater visual temporal acuity [^6dbe6c70]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the main tasks of the human visual system is to organize the temporal flow of visual events into meaningful patterns. It has been suggested that segregation/integration of continuous visual stimuli relies on temporal windows that are phase-locked to brain oscillations in the alpha frequency range (~10 Hz). From a behavioral point of view, the balance between integration and segregation is reflected in visual temporal acuity: the ability to perceive a small temporal gap between two identical stimuli. Disruption of this balance may lead to impairment of perceptual organization processes. Notably, schizophrenia, a condition characterized by unusual perceptual experiences, has been associated with abnormal temporal processing of sensory stimuli and aberrant oscillations. We asked a large cohort of healthy participants to complete an online version of the two-flash fusion task and two questionnaires for schizotypal personality traits to investigate individual differences in the temporal resolution of perception, particularly its relationship with anomalous perceptual experiences. We found that two-flash discrimination acuity declines with age and that schizotypal traits are associated with better performances. Although this association was strong for perceptual and cognitive subscales, we found that this result could not be attributed to response biases (e.g., hallucination of two flashes). While these results appear to contrast with findings of slower alpha rhythms and sensory processing in schizotypy, we propose that a faster visual rate could be the consequence of an oscillopathy or a disconnection between different sensory modalities and their physiological pacemaker.

### Humans without a sense of smell breathe differently [^2241e5e8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In contrast to the notion of olfaction as an unimportant sense, anosmia is associated with assorted deleterious outcomes, and significantly reduced quality of life. The negative impact most commonly associated with anosmia, particularly acquired anosmia, is dulled affect and depression. Sufferers often report feelings of personal isolation and emotional blunting. This aspect of life with anosmia garnered significant attention in COVID-19, which is associated with anosmia that may linger far past the viral attack. Sufferers often describe the anhedonia associated with olfactory loss as life-altering. In addition to this primary impact of anosmia, additional consequences include dietary complications, social difficulties, and loss of an important signal for danger, particularly smoke. This long list culminates in an outcome in acquired anosmia where severity is related to 5-year mortality such that (acquired) anosmic older adults have over three times the odds of death compared to normosmic individuals.

### What blindness can tell us about seeing again: merging neuroplasticity and neuroprostheses [^e662082a]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the development of visual neuroprostheses to restore vision in blind individuals. Appropriate delivery of electrical stimulation to intact visual structures can evoke patterned sensations of light in those who have been blind for many years. However, success in developing functional visual prostheses requires an understanding of how to communicate effectively with the visually deprived brain in order to merge what is perceived visually with what is generated electrically.

### Somatosensory deficits and neural correlates in cerebral palsy: a scoping review [^4aa41791]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

As shown in Figure 1 and according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health validated for CP, somatosensory function was categorized into three subtypes: tactile, proprioception, and pain. For each subtype, two domains were considered: registration (or sensation) and perception. First, registration refers to the external or internal stimulus detection by the somatosensory receptor, that is, when the stimulus exceeds the receptor sensory threshold. For tactile and pain functions, registration can be subdivided according to mechanical (e.g. vibration threshold, tactile threshold with monofilaments, pain pressure threshold with pinprick) and thermal (e.g. cold/hot detection or pain threshold) stimuli. For proprioception, registration refers to the detection of movement (e.g. identifying when a limb is passively moved or identifying the direction of movement). Second, perception is to 'understand, interpret or give meaning to sensory stimuli'. For tactile and pain functions, perception gathers spatial (e.g. stereognosis, two‐point discrimination, graphesthesia, localization of painful stimulation), temporal (e.g. judgment of tactile temporal order, temporal summation), and modality‐specific components (e.g. texture discrimination, size of coins). For proprioception, perception refers to the sense of limb position and movement (e.g. matching the position of one limb with the contralateral limb).

Quality assessment

The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Kmet quality assessmentto identify the strengths and weaknesses of each study included in this scoping review. The scale consists of 14 items rated from 0 to 2 (0, the paper does not meet the criterion; 1, the paper partially meets the criterion; 2, the paper meets the criterion) assessing the study objective and design, participant characteristics, measures and methods of analyses, results, and conclusions. Two authors independently assessed each article. Any discrepancy was resolved by consensus. The summary score for each paper was expressed as the percentage of the potential maximum score (total sum divided by the total possible sum). The total possible sum equaled 22 since items relative to interventional studies were not considered. A Cohen's weighted κ score was used to determine the consensus interrater agreement for (1) each article and (2) each checklist item of the quality assessment tool.

### History of research in medical image perception [^f68f2bda]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Human observers engage in 2 interrelated processes when interpreting medical images: perception and analysis. Perception is the unified awareness of the content of a displayed image that is present while the stimulus is on. Analysis is determining the meaning of the perception in the context of the medical problem that initiated the acquisition of the image. Radiologists have, correctly, regarded image analysis as their primary field of research. They have naively assumed that what they perceive in images is a faithful representation of the images' information content and have not been concerned with perception unless it fails. Failures have stimulated research on quantifying observer performance, defining image quality, and understanding perceptual error. This article traces the historical development of the use of receiver operating characteristic analysis for describing performance, the development of signal-to-noise ratio psychophysical models for defining task-dependent image quality, studies of error in small lesion detection, and the beginnings of studies of the nature of expertise in image interpretation. The history is traced through published articles.

### Noninvasive diagnostic method to objectively measure olfaction and diagnose smell disorders by a molecularly targeted fluorescence imaging agent [^73503f34]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Olfaction (sense of smell) is crucial for the survival of most animals, including humans, attributed to its vital transfer of information about the food and environment, which instinctively serves as a tool for inter- and intraspecies communication. Over the past 3 y, mostly as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, loss of smell (anosmia) has captured the attention not only of the scientific community but also of the general public and has highlighted the need for a deeper mechanistic understanding of this sense. Most importantly, the lack of rapid assessments has exposed the need for objective tools to assess anosmia. It is estimated that about 13.3 million adults in the United States have a vast range of smell disorders and that 3.4 million endure severe hyposmia or complete anosmia. These studies were performed before the COVID-19 virus pandemic and therefore severely underestimate people currently with smell disorders.

### Nociceptors – noxious stimulus detectors [^a8815e00]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

In order to deal effectively with danger, it is imperative to know about it. This is what nociceptors do — these primary sensory neurons are specialized to detect intense stimuli and represent, therefore, the first line of defense against any potentially threatening or damaging environmental inputs. By sensing noxious stimuli and contributing to the necessary reactions to avoid them — rapid withdrawal and the experience of an intensely unpleasant or painful sensation, nociceptors are essential for the maintenance of the body's integrity. Although nociceptive pain is clearly an adaptive alarm system, persistent pain is maladaptive, essentially an ongoing false alarm. Here, we highlight the genesis of nociceptors during development and the intrinsic properties of nociceptors that enable them to transduce, conduct, and transmit nociceptive information and also discuss how their phenotypic plasticity contributes to clinical pain.

### The suboptimality of perceptual decision making with multiple alternatives [^23171727]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Perception has been conceptualized as a process of inference for over a century and a half. According to this view, the outside world is encoded in a pattern of neural firing and the brain needs to decide what these patterns signify. Hundreds of papers have revealed that this inference process is suboptimal in a number of different ways. However, these papers have almost exclusively employed tasks with only two stimulus categories (though notable exceptions exist). Experimental designs where decisions are always between two alternatives cannot fully capture the processes inherent in naturalistic perceptual decisions where stimuli can belong to many different categories (e.g. which of all possible local species does a particular tree belong to). Therefore, fully understanding the mechanisms and limitations of perceptual decision making requires that we characterize the process of making decisions with multiple alternatives.

One critical difference between perceptual decisions with two versus multiple alternatives is the richness of the sensory information that the decisions are based on. Decisions with two alternatives can be based on the evidence for each of the two categories, or even just the difference between these two pieces of evidence. For example, traditional theories such as signal detection theoryand the drift diffusion modelpostulate that two-choice tasks are performed by first summarizing the evidence down to a single number — the location on the evidence axis in signal detection theory and the identity of the boundary that is crossed in drift diffusion — that is subsequently used for decision making. Thus, the sensory information relevant for the decision in such tasks is relatively simple and could potentially be represented in decision-making circuits without substantial loss of information. However, the relevant sensory information in multi-alternative decisions is more complex because it contains the evidence for each of the multiple alternatives available. Further, this richer sensory information can no longer be summarized in a simple form in decision-making circuits without a substantial loss of information (Fig. 1). However, it is currently unknown whether decision-making circuits can represent the rich information from sensory circuits in the context of multi-alternative decisions or whether the decision-making circuits only represent a crude summary of the sensory representation.

### Tasks and their role in visual neuroscience [^5c437582]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

Vision is widely used as a model system to gain insights into how sensory inputs are processed and interpreted by the brain. Historically, careful quantification and control of visual stimuli have served as the backbone of visual neuroscience. There has been less emphasis, however, on how an observer's task influences the processing of sensory inputs. Motivated by diverse observations of task-dependent activity in the visual system, we propose a framework for thinking about tasks, their role in sensory processing, and how we might formally incorporate tasks into our models of vision.

### Sniffing out meaning: chemosensory and semantic neural network changes in sommeliers [^db24aee9]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The wine experience of sommeliers is based on the combination of discriminative abilities to perceive, process, and categorize subtle sensory differences in taste (e.g. sweetness, sourness) chemesthesis (e.g. astringency) and retronasal olfactory components of flavor (e.g. berry, earth) and of language and memory abilities to relate lexical labels to these perceptual distinctions (see Chen; Hughson & Boakes). Attaching labels to flavors in a way that makes these fine‐grain perceptual distinctions possible is certainly a difficult feat. Whether recognition and identification of flavors in sommeliers are attributable to enhanced semantic knowledge and/or perceptual memory remains an open question (Ballester et al; Gawel; Parr et al.). The precise mechanisms that coordinate activity between different neural ensembles, specifically the chemosensory and semantic circuits involved in the wine‐tasting process, remain unclear (Carreiras et al; Herholz & Zatorre; Maguire et al.). Activation of the language circuit is expected for sommeliers if their skills indeed heavily rely on their extensive flavor and aroma lexicon. However, changes in activation and/or changes in connectivity in the flavor circuit, especially in primary areas, are also expected if sommeliers rely on fine perceptual distinctions.

### Executive dysfunctions mediate between altered sensory processing and daily activity performance in older adults [^4afd614d]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sensory processing refers to the way individuals manage incoming sensory information, including its reception, modulation and integration with other brain areas and networks, to produce an adaptive output to environmental demands. Since sensory systems provide the brain with ongoing information about the environment, adequate sensory processing is fundamental for proper cognitive and emotional function, for accurate movements, for learning, for socializing and for other activities that characterize our daily lives.

Altered sensory processing refers to difficulties to modulate and organize the intensity of response to sensory input in a graded and adaptive manner. Altered sensory modulation result in hypo or hypersensitivity to sensory input. Individuals with hypersensitivity respond to sensation faster, intensely and for a longer duration. They are overwhelmed with sensation and even experience "regular" stimuli as painful. This may lead to behavioral dysregulation expressed in stressful behavior, anxiety, irritability and avoidance from interactions with the physical and the social environments. On the contrary, individuals with hyposensitivity tend to miss sensory stimuli and thus fail to respond accurately to environmental demands. Both hyper or hypo sensitivity may restrict adaptive behavior and interfere with daily activity performance.

One of the theoretical models that refers to the interaction between the neurological-threshold to sensory input and the related behavioral regulation is Dunn's model. According to this model, the interaction between the neurological threshold and behavioral regulation results in four patterns: (1) Low registration - people with high neurological thresholds (hyposensitive) and passive behavioral strategies that fail to detect sensory information and do not seek for it; (2) Sensory seekers - people with high neurological threshold who actively seek for rich and intense sensory stimuli (3) Sensory sensitivity – people with low neurological thresholds (hypersensitive) and passive behavioral, meaning they do not actively eliminate uncomfortable sensations; thus, they frequently experience discomfort, distraction, and emotional burden (4) Sensory avoiding - people with low neurological thresholds who actively limit their exposure to unpleasant sensations.

### Emotional event perception is related to lexical complexity and emotion knowledge [^e06193f6]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed and internally replicated the predicted association between active emotion vocabulary and emotion segmentation performance. People who perceive emotion events in higher agreement with the group (manifested in the paradigm as reaching greater emotion segmentation consensus with the group) also generated more unique emotion labels that were obtained at later ages and hence can be interpreted as more semantically complex and sophisticated. These findings complement previous findings from the literature demonstrating a link between emotion labels and emotion perception –. Critically, the present findings suggest that the impact of emotion language on emotion perception was not an artifact of previous experimental designs, where researchers introduced labels into the task.

Exploratory analysis using signal detection metrics revealed that both the primary emotion segmentation metric (Consensus Event Agreement) and active emotion vocabulary metrics are correlated with a more liberal criterion to segment. People with a broader and more sophisticated active emotion vocabulary may achieve higher agreement with others by being liberal about what counts as a change in emotion. It is possible that the Emotion Segmentation Paradigm has encouraged a more liberal strategy, given how participants were instructed (i.e. to segment even when they do not immediately know what the emotional change is). Participants may be motivated by the task instruction to "identify" emotional changes regardless of the actual presence of a specific emotional change. Prior research suggests that individuals may adjust their criterion to be more liberal if the structure of the environment makes it more costly to miss a target. While there was technically no cost to missing a target in our paradigm, participants may have interpreted the instructions in such a manner.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^8d105a38]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea measurement — measurement priorities and instrument domains are outlined: As with pain, dyspnea can and should be measured to assess it adequately, and instruments pertaining to dyspnea should be classified as pertaining to domains of sensory–perceptual experience, affective distress, or symptom/disease impact or burden. These categories are in some ways discrete definitions of dyspnea, but are not mutually exclusive, and many instruments measure more than one domain, with sensory–perceptual measures including ratings of intensity or sensory quality. Ratings often use single-item scales such as visual analog scales, Borg ratings, Likert-type ratings, or numerical (e.g., 0–10) rating scales, and measures of affective distress may use single or multiple-item scales. There is experimental evidence that affective unpleasantness of pain is at least potentially distinguishable from its intensity, and several studies suggest this also may be the case for dyspnea; however, most real-time dyspnea measures have used a single scale and have not distinguished whether the scale measured intensity, unpleasantness, or distress.

### Seeing and acting at the same time: challenges for brain (and) research [^1940cda7]. Neuron (2003). Low credibility.

Traditionally, studies of the visual system of nonhuman primates have investigated neurons while the animal fixates a target in a static environment. Clearly, this is not what our everyday life is like; neither the environment nor we are stationary while we act in our world. On the contrary, we constantly move our eyes or limbs. Here we review a number of recent studies describing the brain in a more realistic mode of operation.

### Minimal exposure durations reveal visual processing priorities for different stimulus attributes [^47665535]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Previous studies have suggested a processing advantage and faster access to awareness for upright over inverted faces –, and for emotional over neutral faces, (although the latter claim, in particular, has been challenged –). If so, processing — and possibly awareness — of upright and emotional faces should require shorter minimal exposures than inverted and neutral faces, respectively.

In this work, we use a combination of behavioural and neural approaches to test these hypotheses. In our first experiments, observers were presented with both intact faces and their scrambled counterparts, equated for luminance and contrast, and we measured the minimal exposure duration that was necessary to detect aspects of meaning in the stimulus. Specifically, we measured sensitivity to the location of the stimulus that contained a face (rather than the noise stimulus containing low-level information consistent with a face), and also measured sensitivity to the emotional identity of that face. The two-alternative forced-choice localisation task meant that observers could only succeed by focusing on the extraction of meaning from stimuli (i.e. parsing the particular arrangement of stimulus features into a face), and the application of signal detection analyses enabled criterion-free measurement of sensitivity to these different stimulus aspects. In addition, our tasks also asked observers to rate their own subjective visual experience on each trial, allowing us to assess the degree to which observers were sensitive to their own perceptions of the stimuli. In subsequent experiments, we augmented these procedures with experiments examining how meaningful stimulus attributes may affect single-stimulus detection (indicating meaning extraction), as well as experiments that collected a set of EEG measures, allowing us to evaluate the match between behavioural sensitivity to stimulus aspects and neural indices of processing. The high-precision bottom-up stimulation provided by the tachistoscope enabled accurate measurement of the minimal exposure durations required for perception of meaning.

### Sniffing out meaning: chemosensory and semantic neural network changes in sommeliers [^d59480c2]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Wine tasting is a very complex process that integrates a combination of sensation, language, and memory. Taste and smell provide perceptual information that, together with the semantic narrative that converts flavor into words, seem to be processed differently between sommeliers and naïve wine consumers. We investigate whether sommeliers' wine experience shapes only chemosensory processing, as has been previously demonstrated, or if it also modulates the way in which the taste and olfactory circuits interact with the semantic network. Combining diffusion‐weighted images and fMRI (activation and connectivity) we investigated whether brain response to tasting wine differs between sommeliers and nonexperts (1) in the sensory neural circuits representing flavor and/or (2) in the neural circuits for language and memory. We demonstrate that training in wine tasting shapes the microstructure of the left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Using mediation analysis, we showed that the experience modulates the relationship between fractional anisotropy and behavior: the higher the fractional anisotropy the higher the capacity to recognize wine complexity. In addition, we found functional differences between sommeliers and naïve consumers affecting the flavor sensory circuit, but also regions involved in semantic operations. The former reflects a capacity for differential sensory processing, while the latter reflects sommeliers' ability to attend to relevant sensory inputs and translate them into complex verbal descriptions. The enhanced synchronization between these apparently independent circuits suggests that sommeliers integrated these descriptions with previous semantic knowledge to optimize their capacity to distinguish between subtle differences in the qualitative character of the wine.

### Appearance of fetal pain could be associated with maturation of the mesodiencephalic structures [^11e81a04]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

While it is absolutely clear to the subject suffering pain just how much they are exposed to suffering as a result of noxious substances, there is a large difference in the opinions of others about how much pain the subject is exposed to, and whether the subject is experiencing pain at all. The differences in attitudes towards what structures of the central nervous system (CNS) are necessary for the patient to be experiencing pain become more significant when the necessity for the introduction of analgesic therapy is considered. This issue is particularly prominent in patients, such as those with brain damage, who cannot describe the pain through any form of communication. Fetal pain, which is the topic of this paper, is a special problem.

According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. The traditional standpoint is that the registering of a nociceptive stimulus with a sensory system and perceiving a nociceptive stimulus as painful are not the same process. Nociception includes registering noxious stimuli with specialized free nerve endings and transmitting information about it. Data provided with nociception are imperfect and incomplete for the CNS to make a direct copy for current events. Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment.

### Decoding individual identity from brain activity elicited in imagining common experiences [^24b8dccd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Almost everyone can imagine themselves at a wedding, however each person does so differently because they have been to different weddings and hence draw upon memories that no one else has. Our personal history of episodic memories contributes to defining us as individuals and in extreme cases — where memories are of traumatic events — can profoundly affect our psychological health and quality of life. A principal goal of cognitive science is to understand how such memories are represented and manipulated in the human brain. Memories of past experiences can be activated and relived through recollection and are thought to be pieced together to support the mental simulation of hypothetical scenarios –. Functional brain imaging now enables the systematic study of brain activation elicited during recall and imagination. A long-term vision for the future might therefore be to devise technology that provides a comprehensive neural readout of the information that one voluntarily activates in mental imagery. More humble prerequisites for this are to establish that neural activity elicited during imagery captures meaningful differences between different individuals' mental simulations of similar kinds of events, and to devise quantitative methods that can predict the information represented in neural activation.

In previous work, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies of brain activity have identified a core distributed network of neuroanatomical regions that are reliably activated during the recollection and/or imagination of different experiences and scenarios –. Regions that are activated in episodic recollection and simulation strongly overlap, which suggests that similar neural machinery is engaged in both cases,– (although activation patterns elicited in remembering, and imaging possible past and future events are still distinguishable). This core episodic recollection and simulation network includes regions of medial parietal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and medial and lateral temporal lobe –. Researchers seeking to decipher what information is represented in brain activity within regions of this network have shown that different types of event can be distinguished from multiple network regions –, as well different components of individual events – (e.g. people, places, objects, space/time of occurrence). However, it has remained unclear whether differences in activation patterns between individuals imagining similar types of event represent anything more than functionally-irrelevant between-subject noise.

### Vasotocin receptor gene genotypes moderate the relationship between cortical thickness and sensory processing [^7819da91]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sensory processing involves the accumulation, interpretation, and modulation of sensory information by the central nervous system. The brain processes and organizes extrinsic and intrinsic sensory information to appropriately respond to specific situational demands. Sensory input regulation requires a balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance). Moreover, a neurological threshold is important for adequately regulating sensory input. All animals, including humans, have different sensory thresholds which lead to different behavioral patterns.

Considering sensory thresholds and human behavior, Dunn et al. developed a sensory processing model, which states that two levels of neurological thresholds for sensory inputs (i.e. high or low) interact with two behavioral strategies (i.e. passive or active). Thus, four sensory-processing patterns exist in this model: "low registration", "sensation seeking", "sensory sensitivity", and "sensation avoiding".

Individuals with "low registration", have higher neurological thresholds for sensory input and passive behavioral strategies and are characterized by reduced responsiveness to everyday sensory events. In contrast, sensation seekers have a higher threshold and exhibit active behavioral strategies. These individuals actively seek intense stimuli to enhance their sensory richness. In contrast, individuals with "sensory sensitivity" or "sensation avoiding" have a low neurological threshold for sensory stimuli (i.e. hypersensitivity) and experience discomfort with sensations. However, in the behavioral strategy dimension, individuals with "sensory sensitivity", who adopt passive strategies, are less likely to show avoidance responses to sensory stimuli. Whereas sensory avoiders, who take on active strategies, attempt to limit their exposure to sensations. Based on Dunn's sensory processing model, the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) questionnaire was developed which reflects the quadrant dimensions of human behavioral responses to various sensory inputs encountered in everyday life. Thus, the questionnaire has been used to assess individual differences in sensory profiles.

### Advances in olfactory augmented virtual reality towards future metaverse applications [^1ecbb466]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Virtual reality (VR) technology typically employs visual and auditory devices, such as head-mounted displays and VR goggles, but further immersion in virtual spaces can be achieved through wearable devices including gloves, exoskeletons, shoes, etc. and electronic skins (e-skin). These wearable devices enable the realization of full-body sensory perception or sensation, requiring the capability to perceive human movements, simulate sensations, and being flexible and comfortable for users (Fig. 1). Recently, sensors for detecting physical signals, e.g. stretch, pressure, temperature, etc. have been flourishing. They can be utilized for biosensing and detecting human motion signals. In addition, wearable systems integrating multiple types of flexible actuators, such as tendon actuators, pneumatic actuators, and electrostatic actuators, can achieve kinesthetic, electro-tactile, vibrotactile, and thermal-tactile feedback, respectively. Such systems provide tactile stimulation to the skin's sensory receptors. Multimodal haptic feedback enables users a better immersive sensory experience by enhancing interaction between humans and virtual environments. For example, an augmented tactile-perception and haptic feedback ring, equipped with multimodal sensing encompassing tactile, temperature sensing, and feedback encompassing vibratory and thermal haptic stimuli, demonstrates the potential beyond the commercial rings. A skin-integrated wireless haptic interface using actuator arrays offers multimodal mechanisms for complex feedback. Within this interface, various feedback modes including mechanical, electrotactile, and thermal, are utilized to target distinct cutaneous receptors selectively, offering users diverse haptic sensations. The fusion of VR display technology with such multimodal somatosensory sensation for full-body perception and feedback is essential for future metaverse applications. An augmented 3D virtual society, i.e. a 4D VR world, could facilitate intelligent and interactive experiences across various domains such as social interactions, education, entertainment, healthcare, etc.

### Dysconnection in schizophrenia: from abnormal synaptic plasticity to failures of self-monitoring [^45b68ee0]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

First-rank symptoms, which were initially defined by Schneider in an attempt to isolate those symptoms that are pathognomonic of schizophrenia, continue to have major importance in clinical classifications of schizophrenia. First-rank symptoms are essentially experiences of "passivity", ie, patients report that their actions, thoughts, or emotions are no longer caused by themselves but are imposed upon them by external forces or agents. For example, schizophrenic patients may report that their thoughts are being "inserted" or "broadcast", that alien voices may tell them what to do or comment on their actions, or that some external force or agent is controlling their movements. While many patients who fulfill current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia do not have first-rank symptoms, these are the symptoms that are the most difficult to understand because they are so far outside our normal experience. These symptoms, therefore, provide the toughest test for any account of schizophrenia.

First-rank symptoms may result from a diminished ability to distinguish between events that we control (eg, self-generated inner speech or limb movements) and those that occur independently of us in the external world (eg, someone else speaking or some external force moving our limbs). Normally, we can differentiate between these events depending on how well we can predict the sensory input they evoke. For example, regardless of whether we actively move our arm or whether our arm is moved by someone else, somatosensory areas of our brain receive input from peripheral proprioceptors. However, when the movement is self-generated, the sensory areas also receive a signal from motor areas, informing them about the intended movement and thus allowing them to predict the proprioceptive input they should be receiving. This signal has been called a "corollary discharge", or "efference copy". The prediction conveyed by corollary discharge from motor areas may be used to cancel or explain away the sensation that is normally associated with proprioceptive input and the associated activation of sensory areas. A corresponding corollary discharge mechanism is used to deal with changes in visual perception induced by self-generated eye movements. Neurophysiological studies in primates suggest that during self-generated saccades the frontal eye field receives a corollary discharge signal from the superior colliculus that may be used for coordinating sequential saccades and for stabilizing vision across saccades. Similarly, there is evidence from human fMRI studies that during eye blinks frontal oculomotor regions send a corollary discharge signal to visual areas, probably to ensure a stable visual percept across blinks.

### Should concepts of brain functions be based on psychology or anatomy? An echo from kurt goldstein [^3fd78134]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

The findings raise the question, does the brain have domains or rather does the brain comprise anatomical structures that allow neural processing resulting in what we call 'functions' in different 'domains'? In other words, are 'domains' human-made constructs, useful artefacts, that aim to describe dissociations in behaviour? Or should we not rather use our understanding of anatomy as a tool for developing concepts about the functions of the brain? And use these concepts to interpret observations in patients and to build appropriate tests?

These questions are not at all new. For illustration we provide some citations from Kurt Goldstein (Fig. 1A, translation of the German text by the authors).

'Symptoms are answers that the organism gives to very specific questions that we pose… which are determined by the theories we have about the construction and function of the nervous system'.
'Even in circumscribed lesions… when not affecting primary motor and sensory centres, we always find disturbances in all domains… The analysis of symptoms always led to the conclusion that these disturbances do not lead to a deficiency of certain performances, restricted to e.g. one sense, or learned skills, but to changes in certain basic functions'.
Kaufmann and colleagues focus on the brain's connections rather than the cortical areas. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the visualization of these connections in vivo. Moreover, studying the brain's connections may contribute more readily to understanding its organization than studying cortical parcellations.

'The concepts based on the tenets derived from fibre tracts seem to be the most adequate at the moment. This does not mean that basic processing takes place in these fibre tracts themselves, but that their meaning lies only in connecting parts of the nervous system to construct functional units'.

Utilizing differentiation processing method to process tactile information and mimic multiple receptors.

a Schematic diagram of the comprehensive pipeline designed to process tactile sensory stimuli. This approach initially captures immediate tactile interactions through the resistance changes in a piezoresistive film, employing Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) and the required information exchange interface. Concurrently, it archives historical sensory data from the memristor state, leveraging the memory properties of a memristor. Subsequently, sensory features are extracted from both the current state of the piezoresistive film and the memristor to select a memristive adaptive modulation scheme, driving the nociception, recovery, or adaptation process, based on the memristor conductance change. The entire sensory data acquisition, feature extraction, and modulation scheme selection process are managed through the FPGA control platform. Note that the memristor is detected and modulated under the cooperation of the encoder and memristor-based process modules within the hardware setup.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^16297b1a]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain physiology — pain involves both sensation and response, beginning with activation of nociceptors and transmission via second-order pain neurons to the brain stem and cortex, with descending modulation from the cortex to the spinal cord. Perception integrates the modulated pain signal with sensory and cognitive inputs, and identical stimuli can elicit exaggerated or diminished responses based on context; patient reported self-efficacy is a better predictor of satisfaction with pain management than the nociceptive stimulus itself. Pain perception is dynamic, with continued pain producing neural changes that amplify or diminish sensation; in the spinal cord, continued pain can lead to up-regulation of receptors and an amplified response to repeated stimuli, a phenomenon thought to be important in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. Chronic pain is continued perception of pain without an obvious or ongoing anatomic trigger; development of chronic pain is common after trauma and can lead to significant long-term functional impairment and potentially a substance use disorder. Because pain is a multidimensional emotional and sensory experience, a patient's response can vary widely based on physiologic, psychologic, and contextual factors.

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^aa328b10]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, it has been shown that momentary affective experience during decision-making tasks reflects a temporal integration of reward expectations and prediction errors resulting from these expectations. The formulation that the valence feature of affect is a function of recent prediction error history effectively means that experienced pleasantness signals whether an environment is getting better or worse than expected in terms of available rewards, called environmental momentum. Hence, fluctuations in valence become a useful signal for learning and adaptive behavior. The influence of prediction error history on temporal representation of affective experience has also been shown in more naturalistic settings. Moreover, expected consequences of actions induce affective changes. Anticipation of rewards and losses induce positive and negative states with a level of arousal proportional to the uncertainty of the expected outcome. People also generate anticipatory autonomic arousal responses when considering a risky option. Thus, the construction of affect incorporate elements such as "anticipatory affect", and experienced utility from anticipationthrough input from the current environment as well as possible future outcomes.

These findings also provide support for several theoretical frameworks focusing on the temporal unfolding of affective experiences. In general, appraisal theories of emotion posit that an event is evaluated based on several appraisal criteria (e.g. novelty, goal relevance, pleasantness). In other words, affective experience depends on novelty, goal-relevance, and pleasantness of events. Novelty aspect can be directly linked to prediction errors since novel or unexpected events generate larger prediction errors, and the sign of the prediction error likely depends on whether the event is evaluated as pleasant or unpleasant. Furthermore, goal-relevance of an experienced outcome modulate how it will eventually be integrated into the ongoing affective state. These appraisal criteria can be a useful starting point in investigating contextual and individual variation in affective integration. However, note that most appraisal theories are interested in the temporal dynamics of emotional experience within a window that starts with an event and ends in experience, which is a different scope than the current perspective. Another theoretical model of affective dynamics to note is the iterative reprocessing model, a dynamical-systems account of human information processing. The model underlines the importance of temporal dependence of mental states and posits that affective experience at a given point in time (t) is determined by an integration of affect experienced and anticipated at a previous time point (t-1) and the currently processed information. The empirical evidence reviewed in this section is clearly in line with this prediction.

### Quantitative sensory testing: report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^64680bc1]. Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) methodology — methods of limits and levels — employs algorithms to facilitate threshold determination using the method of limits and the method of levels; in limits, the subject indicates detection during ascending or descending ramps and thresholds depend on stimulus rate of change, tending to be higher and more variable and being a "reaction time inclusive" technique, whereas levels tests predefined intensities as a "forced choice" algorithm where responses are independent of speed of response but the procedure usually takes longer and is susceptible to errors from decreased attention.

### Optimal representation of sensory information by neural populations [^9a998d8b]. Nature Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

Sensory information is encoded by populations of neurons. The responses of individual neurons are inherently noisy, so the brain must interpret this information as reliably as possible. In most situations, the optimal strategy for decoding the population signal is to compute the likelihoods of the stimuli that are consistent with an observed neural response. But it has not been clear how the brain can directly compute likelihoods. Here we present a simple and biologically plausible model that can realize the likelihood function by computing a weighted sum of sensory neuron responses. The model provides the basis for an optimal decoding of sensory information. It explains a variety of psychophysical observations on detection, discrimination and identification, and it also directly predicts the relative contributions that different sensory neurons make to perceptual judgments.
