## Question

why is verapamil contraindicated in patients with AV block?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why verapamil is contraindicated in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verapamil's electrophysiologic mechanism at the AV node. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about AV block as a contraindication. Next, I will review major guideline statements that align with this contraindication. After that, I need to examine the clinical consequences and risk stratification by degree of AV block. I should also consider special scenarios like pacemakers and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize the pathophysiology, clinical evidence, and guideline consensus into a concise, clinically grounded conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that slows AV nodal conduction by decreasing calcium influx through L-type channels, thereby prolonging the AV nodal effective refractory period and increasing PR interval; this is precisely why it is useful for rate control in atrial fibrillation and for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, but it also explains its AV block liability [^111V4MGU] [^113Kqp5M] [^114T9GCF].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before I overstate anything. Multiple FDA labels explicitly contraindicate verapamil in second- or third-degree AV block unless the patient has a functioning ventricular pacemaker, and they extend the same caution to sick sinus syndrome; this is consistent across oral and IV formulations and across different brand labels, which reinforces that this is a class-wide, mechanism-based contraindication rather than a formulation-specific issue [^116KDk7J] [^113wGAbk] [^115YgA86] [^116KDk7J].

> I should confirm that major guidelines align with labeling, not just assume. The ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline lists AV block greater than first degree as a precaution or contraindication unless a pacemaker is present, and the VA/DoD hypertension guideline explicitly notes verapamil is contraindicated in second- or third-degree AV block; the ESC hypertension guidance similarly lists high-grade SA or AV block as a compelling contraindication to verapamil and diltiazem, and the bradycardia guideline emphasizes identifying reversible causes of AV block while acknowledging that drug-induced block often unmasks intrinsic disease, which supports avoiding AV nodal blockers in higher-grade block [^113ag2xL] [^114jkPmc] [^114Hx7Xt] [^113ztLL3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about degree of block without checking the clinical consequences. In patients with existing impaired AV conduction, verapamil's negative dromotropy can convert first-degree to higher-grade block, precipitate high-grade AV block, cause bradycardia with escape rhythms, and in severe cases lead to asystole; labels also note that PR prolongation correlates with verapamil exposure, particularly during titration, and that progression to second- or third-degree block mandates dose reduction or discontinuation and may require pacing, which underscores the hemodynamic fragility in this setting [^116yjyo9] [^114T9GCF] [^116yjyo9] [^117A2EEw].

> I need to ensure I stratify risk appropriately. First-degree AV block is not an absolute contraindication, but it warrants caution and ECG monitoring because verapamil can further prolong AV nodal conduction; second-degree (especially Mobitz II) and third-degree AV block are absolute contraindications unless a pacemaker is in place, given the risk of progression to complete heart block and hemodynamic collapse; this risk stratification is consistent with FDA labeling and guideline cautions and is reinforced by reports of complete AV block with verapamil, particularly in the setting of drug interactions or high exposure [^1171E38h] [^113ag2xL] [^115XZXU7].

> But wait, what if a pacemaker is present — does that change the calculus? Yes, the contraindication is conditional: verapamil may be used in patients with second- or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome if there is a functioning ventricular pacemaker, because the device mitigates the risk of dangerous bradycardia or asystole; this exception is explicitly stated in FDA labeling and is echoed in guideline discussions of AV nodal blockers in paced patients [^113wGAbk] [^115YgA86].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that amplify risk, because concomitant AV nodal blockade is common. Coadministration with beta-blockers, diltiazem, digoxin, amiodarone, or other negative chronotropes increases the risk of severe bradycardia and high-grade AV block; notably, IV verapamil and IV esmolol in close proximity have been associated with fatal cardiovascular collapse, and expert pharmacology guidance advises avoiding verapamil–beta-blocker combinations or exercising extreme caution with monitoring, which is especially pertinent in patients with any baseline conduction delay [^111j9Kpx] [^115sgqmB] [^116FkwXo] [^114jkPmc].

> Let me consider whether verapamil can itself cause AV block in patients without preexisting disease, because that affects counseling. Labels document that AV block can occur even without preexisting conduction defects, though higher-grade block is infrequent; moreover, contemporary data suggest that many cases of "drug-related" AV block reflect unmasked intrinsic conduction disease rather than true drug causation, with high recurrence rates after drug withdrawal, which reinforces the need to avoid AV nodal blockers in higher-grade block and to consider pacing when disease is significant [^114T9GCF] [^116vPpDJ] [^112tmfWA] [^111y7EAC].

> I will now examine the clinical scenarios where verapamil is otherwise indicated, to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Verapamil remains appropriate for rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter and for AVNRT in hemodynamically stable patients without significant conduction disease, but in AF with preexcitation (WPW), AV nodal blockers are contraindicated because they may accelerate ventricular rates via the accessory pathway; this distinction is important so we don't conflate separate contraindications with the AV block issue [^113VKrgp] [^112H4hFk] [^113ag2xL].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the answer succinctly. Verapamil is contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree AV block because it predictably slows AV nodal conduction and can precipitate complete heart block, dangerous bradycardia, or asystole in those with impaired AV conduction; this is a mechanism-based, label-supported contraindication that aligns with major cardiology guidelines, with the key exception that a functioning pacemaker allows cautious use by mitigating bradyarrhythmic risk [^1171E38h] [^113wGAbk] [^113ag2xL].

---

Verapamil is contraindicated in AV block because it **slows AV nodal conduction** [^113Kqp5M] and can precipitate or worsen second- or third-degree block, risking bradycardia, asystole, or cardiac arrest [^116yjyo9]. It is only permissible if the patient has a **functioning pacemaker** [^113wGAbk] [^116KDk7J]. Use in AV block without pacing is contraindicated by FDA labeling [^1171E38h] and major guidelines due to these life-threatening risks [^114jkPmc] [^114Hx7Xt].

---

## Mechanism of action and electrophysiological effects

Verapamil is a **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker** that inhibits L-type calcium channels in the AV node, slowing conduction and increasing refractoriness [^113Kqp5M]. This AV nodal delay is beneficial for rate control in SVT/AF [^114jkPmc] but can **precipitate high-grade block** in patients with existing conduction disease [^112d2Lyo].

---

## Clinical evidence of AV block with verapamil

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show verapamil can cause **first-degree, second-degree, and complete AV block**, particularly in patients with preexisting conduction disease or high plasma levels [^115bAxTU] [^116yjyo9]. Higher-grade block is infrequent but clinically significant and may require dose reduction or discontinuation [^115bAxTU].

---

## FDA labeling and clinical guidelines

FDA labeling explicitly contraindicates verapamil in **second- or third-degree AV block** unless a pacemaker is present [^1171E38h] [^113wGAbk]. Major guidelines (ACC/AHA/HRS, ESC) align with this, advising avoidance in high-grade AV block without pacing due to the risk of bradyarrhythmias and hemodynamic collapse [^113ag2xL] [^114Hx7Xt].

---

## Clinical consequences of verapamil use in AV block

In AV block, verapamil can cause:

- **Progression of block**: Second- or third-degree block, asystole, or cardiac arrest [^115bAxTU] [^116yjyo9].
- **Bradycardia**: Severe bradycardia or sinus arrest, especially with concomitant AV nodal blockers [^116FkwXo] [^111j9Kpx].
- **Hemodynamic compromise**: Hypotension, syncope, and cardiogenic shock [^111agcyF] [^112DW6fT].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

The principal exception is the presence of a **functioning pacemaker**, in which case verapamil may be used cautiously with monitoring [^113wGAbk] [^1171E38h]. In first-degree AV block, use is not absolutely contraindicated, but close ECG monitoring is advised due to the risk of progression [^115bAxTU].

---

## Alternative medications and management strategies

For patients with AV block who need rate or rhythm control, consider:

- **Beta-blockers**: Use cautiously; may worsen bradycardia/AV block [^114Hx7Xt] [^111j9Kpx].
- **Digoxin**: Use cautiously; monitor for AV block and bradycardia [^116JSoTG].
- **Catheter ablation**: For SVT/AF with conduction disease to avoid AV nodal blockers [^111u4sWJ] [^112H4hFk].
- **Pacemaker implantation**: For persistent high-grade AV block or when AV nodal blockers are necessary [^113ztLL3] [^115oZSYd].

---

## Summary of risks and contraindications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Verapamil use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Second-degree AV block (Mobitz II) | Contraindicated | Risk of progression to complete AV block |
| Third-degree AV block | Contraindicated | Risk of asystole and cardiac arrest |
| First-degree AV block | Use with caution | Risk of progression; monitor ECG |
| AV block with pacemaker | Permitted with caution | Pacemaker mitigates bradyarrhythmia risk |
| SVT/AF without AV block | Permitted | Beneficial AV nodal slowing |

---

Verapamil is contraindicated in AV block because it **slows AV nodal conduction** and can precipitate high-grade block, asystole, or cardiac arrest unless a pacemaker is present [^113Kqp5M] [^1171E38h]. This is supported by FDA labeling and major society guidelines, and alternative therapies or pacing should be considered when AV block is present [^113wGAbk] [^113ag2xL] [^113ztLL3].

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^114T9GCF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with sick sinus syndrome, verapamil hydrochloride may interfere with sinus-node impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block. Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without preexisting conduction defects (see WARNINGS). Verapamil hydrochloride decreases the frequency of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

Verapamil hydrochloride does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but in depressed atrial fibers it decreases amplitude, velocity of depolarization, and conduction velocity. Verapamil hydrochloride may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory bypass tract. Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil (see WARNINGS).

Verapamil hydrochloride has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man.

Essential hypertension: Verapamil hydrochloride exerts antihypertensive effects by decreasing systemic vascular resistance, usually without orthostatic decreases in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia; bradycardia (rate less than 50 beats/min) is uncommon (1.4%). During isometric or dynamic exercise, verapamil hydrochloride does not alter systolic cardiac function in patients with normal ventricular function.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113VKrgp]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to CCBs, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer nondihydropyridine CCBs (such as verapamil or diltiazem) as initial therapy in patients with NSTEMI, continuing or frequently recurring ischemia, contraindications to β-blockers, and in the absence of the following:

- clinically significant LV dysfunction

- increased risk for cardiogenic shock

- PR interval > 0.24 second

- second- or third-degree AV block without a cardiac pacemaker.

### Trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride (tarka) [^112eQTEQ]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Elevated Liver Enzymes/Hepatic Failure

Verapamil Component

Elevations of transaminases with and without concomitant elevations in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin have been reported. Such elevations have sometimes been transient and may disappear even in the face of continued verapamil treatment. Several cases of hepatocellular injury related to verapamil have been proven by rechallenge; half of these had clinical symptoms (malaise, fever, and/or right upper quadrant pain) in addition to elevations of SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase.

Trandolapril Component

ACE inhibitors rarely have been associated with a syndrome of cholestatic jaundice, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

Liver abnormalities were noted in 3.2% of patients taking any of several combinations of trandolapril/verapamil doses. Periodic monitoring of liver function in patients taking TARKA is therefore prudent.

Accessory Bypass Tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndromes)

Verapamil Component

Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the AV node, producing a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving oral verapamil may be at risk and its use in these patients is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after oral verapamil.

Atrioventricular Block

Verapamil Component

The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may lead to asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR interval prolongation is correlated with verapamil plasma concentrations, especially during the early titration phases of therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%) observed. Marked first-degree block or progressive development to second- or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances, discontinuation of verapamil HCl and institution of appropriate therapy depending upon the clinical situation.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^115M2fza]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In another study, Kennebäck et al. suggested that patients on β‐blockers who develop high‐degree AVB and have a QRS duration ≥ 120 ms should be implanted with a permanent pacemaker without further investigation or observation. This study examined patients with symptomatic high‐degree drug‐related AVB who were implanted with a permanent pacemaker at presentation and were enrolled only if their AVB resolved following withdrawal of the offending medication during hospitalization or by the first follow‐up at 1 month. Most individuals were elderly with hypertension and/or ischemic heart disease, as well as heart failure. Furthermore, most patients were on β‐blockers (88%), with the remainder receiving sotalol, verapamil, or digoxin (used alone or in combination). Over a 2‐year period, high‐grade AVB recurred in 59% of patients, with a significantly higher recurrence rate in those with increased QRS duration (≥ 120 ms) (75%) compared to those with normal QRS duration (< 120 ms) (20%) (p < 0.05). The mean time from inclusion to documented high‐degree AVB was 9 ± 7 months. Additionally, 35% of the patients developed symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmias necessitating antiarrhythmic drug treatment and backup pacing. Consequently, 94% of the total patients required permanent pacing due to either high‐degree AVB recurrence or atrial tachyarrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic drug treatment and concomitant backup pacing.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115bAxTU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Accessory bypass tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine): Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the AV node, producing a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving oral verapamil may be at risk and its use in these patients is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after oral verapamil hydrochloride.

Atrioventricular block: The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may cause asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR-interval prolongation is correlated with verapamil plasma concentrations especially during the early titration phase of therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%) observed. Marked first-degree block or progressive development to second-or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances, discontinuation of verapamil HCl and institution of appropriate therapy, depending on the clinical situation.

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS): In 120 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most of them refractory or intolerant to propranolol) who received therapy with verapamil at doses up to 720 mg/day, a variety of serious adverse effects were seen. Three patients died in pulmonary edema; all had severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and a past history of left ventricular dysfunction. Eight other patients had pulmonary edema and/or severe hypotension; abnormally high (greater than 20 mm Hg) pulmonary wedge pressure and a marked left ventricular outflow obstruction were present in most of these patients. Concomitant administration of quinidine (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug interactions) preceded the severe hypotension in 3 of the 8 patients (2 of whom developed pulmonary edema). Sinus bradycardia occurred in 11% of the patients, second-degree AV block in 4%, and sinus arrest in 2%. It must be appreciated that this group of patients had a serious disease with a high mortality rate. Most adverse effects responded well to dose reduction, and only rarely did verapamil use have to be discontinued.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^115yxTit]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrioventricular block (AVB) that develops in patients receiving bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic drug therapy (drug‐related AVB) presents a clinical challenge, prompting considerations about whether the AVB is directly induced by the medications (drug‐induced AVB) or if it reveals a pre‐existing, severe conduction system disease. B‐blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non‐DHP CCBs), class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of AVB in clinical practice. However, an accumulating body of evidence demonstrates a weak cause‐and‐effect relationship between treatment with these agents and AVB, as well as high recurrence rates of AVB following initial resolution after drug discontinuation. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the traditional perception of the natural history and prognosis of patients with drug‐related AVB and the actual clinical outcomes observed in real‐life clinical situations.

Indeed, current guidelines reflect this ambiguity. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines do not recommend permanent pacing for AVB due to transient factors that can be corrected and prevented (Class III recommendation, Level of Evidence C). On the other hand, the Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest that permanent pacemaker implantation may be reasonable for certain patients with symptomatic second‐ or third‐degree AVB who are on chronic stable doses of necessary antiarrhythmic or β‐blocker therapy without further observation for drug washout or reversibility (class IIa recommendation, level of evidence B). Additionally, they note that while a bradycardic drug overdose may cause reversible AVB, therapeutic doses of these medications typically do not lead to AVB. Therefore, the management of drug‐related AVB remains a topic of debate.

In this context, we sought to synthesize current evidence on the clinical characteristics of drug‐related AVB, assess recovery and recurrence outcomes, and propose management strategies for these patients based on the available data reported in the literature.

### Need for prophylactic application of verapamil in transradial coronary procedures: a randomized trial. the VITRIOL (is verapamil in transRadial interventions omittabLe?) trial [^114vsiWS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Population, and Outcome Measures

Our goal was to evaluate the need for prophylactic application of verapamil in transradial coronary procedures. Therefore, we conducted an investigator‐initiated, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled trial with an all‐comers design. Eligible were all patients aged ≥ 18 years with clinical indication for coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention, in whom the right or left radial artery could be successfully cannulated (multiple puncture attempts were allowed). Only patients with known contraindications to verapamil were excluded (significant aortic stenosis, heart rate < 50/min, high‐grade atrioventricular block, myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock, or left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%).

Figure 1 shows an outline of the trial design. After insertion of the arterial sheath, patients received either 5 mg verapamil hydrochloride diluted with 0.9% w/v saline to 10 mL (n = 297) or placebo (10 mL 0.9% w/v saline, the diluent of verapamil in the vials, alone, n = 294) intra‐arterially. In the case of procedural failure, operators determined the underlying cause (spasm or anatomical variation), then they were unblinded and, at their discretion, continued either "unplanned" intra‐arterial administration of 5 mg verapamil (first 5‐mg dose in the placebo arm ["ad hoc"] or a second 5‐mg dose in the verapamil arm ["extra"]) or with primary access site conversion (ie, without prior unplanned use of verapamil). If verapamil was ineffective, the access site was changed (secondary conversion). Arterial spasm was defined by the operator as severe difficulty advancing the guidewire or catheter, with or without (1 case) angiographic evidence, while anatomical variations were all confirmed with angiography. Nonprotocol medications (eg, other vasodilators, analgesics, sedatives) were not administrated during the procedures.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^112zZ9MA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

For all these reasons, substantial uncertainty remains in identifying patients at early risk of AVB recurrence. It is therefore not surprising that reliable risk scores for predicting recurrence after initial AVB resolution are still lacking. This gap in clinical tools makes it challenging to accurately assess patients at higher risk of AVB relapse. Addressing these gaps through prospective studies with standardized EP assessment and drug level monitoring is crucial to improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision‐making in drug‐related AVB.

In this context of limited evidence, managing patients with drug‐related AVB is challenging. Given that true drug‐induced AVB is rare and recurrence rates are high, immediate permanent pacemaker implantation may be advisable, especially for frail elderly patients with drug‐related AVB (Figure 1). This strategy may be relevant even for patients on high doses of bradycardic or antiarrhythmic drugs, those on drug combinations, and those with additional reversible factors like hyperkalemia. Moreover, considering the notably high need for permanent pacing in patients with drug‐related AV block and atrial tachyarrhythmias when antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary, adopting an early permanent pacing approach seems prudent (Figure 1). Finally, because temporary pacing carries a high risk of complications, transitioning directly to permanent pacemaker implantation should be prioritized when temporary pacing is indicated (Figure 1). There are no data in the literature regarding drug‐related AVB in younger populations. It would be reasonable to assume that a more conservative strategy, namely watchful waiting for AVB resolution and close follow‐up could be adopted in younger individuals, particularly in the setting of high doses of bradycardic or antiarrhythmic medications. However, this assumption remains speculative and should be examined in future studies (Figure 1).

Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)
Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension
A history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block [see Contraindications (4)]

Treatment-Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of MAYZENT treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, if not contraindicated, ECG testing and first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4) and Contraindications (4)].
Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, MAYZENT is not recommended in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of MAYZENT in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with MAYZENT is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate, such as ivabradine and digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during MAYZENT initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing MAYZENT treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, MAYZENT can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 50 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 50 bpm. Treatment with MAYZENT can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after MAYZENT has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with MAYZENT should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Fascicular tachycardia in infancy and the use of verapamil: a case series and literature review [^113Z5c9h]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case series of more than nine intravenous infusions of verapamil in three small children, including two infants, shows that verapamil can be used safely and effectively for the treatment of fascicular VT in haemodynamically stable young children and infants. The cases demonstrate that if intravenous verapamil is given slowly the feared side effect of haemodynamic instability and atrioventricular (AV) block may not occur. Given the fact that other treatments are ineffective for fascicular VT, the opinion that the use of intravenous verapamil is contraindicated in infants needs to be challenged for this type of tachycardia.

The recommendation to avoid verapamil in young children is based on very limited evidence but is widely accepted. In the current European Heart Rhythm Association/Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology arrhythmia working group consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias in the paediatric age groupverapamil is listed as contraindicated in infants under 1 year of age for the treatment of SVT and fascicular VT, citing the article of Porter et al from 1983in which two cases of junctional ectopic tachycardia treated with intravenous verapamil responded with hypotension requiring resuscitation with calcium. In that original article intravenous verapamil for treatment of SVT was recommended in all age groups nevertheless. In 2013, Lapage et al published a review titled 'Verapamil in infants: An exaggerated fear?' in which they evaluate the limited evidence that has led to the acceptance of infancy as a contraindication for intravenous verapamil.

In most reported cases of cardiovascular collapse after intravenous verapamil additional risk factors for compromise can clearly be identified, typically long duration of tachycardia with signs of poor cardiac output or congestive heart failure, age < 6 weeks, concomitant sepsis or myocarditis, pretreatment with AV nodal blocking agents such as digoxin or beta blockers or inadvertent administration of an inappropriately high dose of verapamil. There is only one report of a child older than 6 weeks who had a complication with an adequate dose of verapamil; this infant also had myocarditis. Given the availability of adenosine, it is sensible to avoid intravenous verapamil in infants with SVT, especially those with pre-existing haemodynamic compromise or sepsis. However, Roguin et al reported successful verapamil treatment of SVT in two infants aged 20 days and 6 weeks with the administration of calcium gluconate prior to giving intravenous verapamil. They reported haemodynamic stability and no interference with the antiarrhythmic effect of verapamil.

### Brady-and tachyarrhythmias detected by continuous rhythm monitoring in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^114PLjpg]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed a significant association between treatment with ND-CCBs and lower rates of bradyarrhythmia episodes. ND-CCBs reduce myocardial contractility and AV conduction by restricting calcium influx into myocytes, and verapamil was previously associated with less AF progression in PAF. In the RATAF study, diltiazem was more effective in reducing ventricular rate and arrhythmia-related symptoms, and in experimental settings, verapamil has been shown to reduce atrial remodelling. Furthermore, ND-CCBs have a negative dromotropic effect on the AV node, but in contrast to beta-blockers, only have a very limited effect on the sinus node. Therefore, higher dosages of ND-CCBs are tolerated, with appropriate rate control, during paroxysms of AF without sinus bradycardia outside the AF episodes. It is also worth recognising that ND-CCBs are contraindicated in patients with reduced LVEF, and despite multivariable adjustment, patients in ND-CCB treatment could differ on parameters not accounted for in our analysis. Finally, rate control in patients with tachycardia–bradycardia episodes is particularly challenging, and if patients were already symptomatic at baseline, it might have influenced prescription patterns.

### Trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride [^112ZhtMZ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Verapamil Component

Verapamil dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm. This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm, and is responsible for the effectiveness of verapamil in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) as well as unstable angina at rest.

Verapamil regularly reduces the total systemic resistance (afterload) by dilating peripheral arterioles. By decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate-related manner.

Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with sick sinus syndrome, verapamil may interfere with sinus node impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block. Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without preexisting conduction defects (see WARNINGS).

Verapamil does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization and conduction in depressed atrial fibers. Verapamil may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of accessory bypass tracts. Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil (see WARNINGS).

Hemodynamics and Myocardial Metabolism: Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility. Improved left ventricular diastolic function in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) and those with coronary heart disease has also been observed with verapamil therapy. In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by a reduction of afterload and cardiac index is usually not reduced. However, in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., pulmonary wedge pressure about 20 mmHg or ejection fraction less than 30%), or in patients taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents or other cardio-depressant drugs, deterioration of ventricular function may occur (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).

Pulmonary Function: Verapamil does not induce bronchoconstriction and hence, does not impair ventilatory function.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111V4MGU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Verapamil hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.

Mechanism of Action

Angina: The precise mechanism of action of verapamil hydrochloride as an antianginal agent remains to be fully determined, but includes the following two mechanisms:

Relaxation and prevention of coronary artery spasm: Verapamil hydrochloride dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm, whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced. This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm and is responsible for the effectiveness of verapamil hydrochloride in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) as well as unstable angina at rest. Whether this effect plays any role in classical effort angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization. This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina.
Reduction of oxygen utilization: Verapamil hydrochloride regularly reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works both at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles. This unloading of the heart reduces myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and probably accounts for the effectiveness of verapamil hydrochloride in chronic stable effort angina.

Arrhythmia: Electrical activity through the AV node depends, to a significant degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil hydrochloride prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate-related manner. This property accounts for the ability of verapamil hydrochloride to slow the ventricular rate in patients with chronic atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (isoptin SR) [^1132Sawi]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

ISOPTIN regularly reduces the total systemic resistance (afterload) against which the heart works both at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles.

Electrical activity through the AV node depends, to a significant degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By decreasing the influx of calcium, ISOPTIN prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate related manner.

Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with sick sinus syndrome, ISOPTIN may interfere with sinus node impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block.

Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without preexisting conduction defects (see WARNINGS).

ISOPTIN does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization and conduction in depressed atrial fibers. ISOPTIN may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of accessory bypass tracts. Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil (see WARNINGS).

ISOPTIN has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis.

It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: With the immediate release formulation, more than 90% of the orally administered dose of ISOPTIN is absorbed. Because of rapid biotransformation of verapamil during its first pass through the portal circulation, bioavailability ranges from 20% to 35%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached between 1 and 2 hours after oral administration. Chronic oral administration of 120 mg of ISOPTIN every 6 hours resulted in plasma levels of verapamil ranging from 125 to 400 ng/mL with higher values reported occasionally. A nonlinear correlation between the verapamil dose administered and verapamil plasma levels does exist.

2.1 Studies Examining the Outcomes of Patients With Drug‐Related Atrioventricular Block in the Absence of Hyperkalemia or Other Abnormalities

Zeltser et al. were the first to show that AVB is commonly associated with β‐blocker and/or non‐DHP CCB therapy, but drug therapy is rarely the underlying cause. Specifically, the study population consisted of 169 patients with second‐ or third‐degree AVB, most of whom were elderly with hypertension and/or structural heart disease. Of these patients, 54% had drug‐related AVB, whereas the remainder presented with AVB in the absence of drug therapy. Among the patients with drug‐related AVB, the majority were on β‐blockers (67.4%), while 32.6% were on non‐DHP CCBs, and 14.1% were on medications from both drug classes. According to electrocardiographic characteristics, most patients had infranodal block, with only a minority having AV nodal block. Upon hospitalization for AVB, drug therapy was discontinued in 86% of patients with drug‐related AVB. Drug discontinuation was followed by a spontaneous resolution of AVB within 48 h in 41% of these patients. However, 56% of them experienced a recurrence of AVB within the follow‐up period of 3 weeks, often of a worse degree, leading to syncope. Interestingly, spontaneous resolution of AVB was also observed in 23% of patients who had AVB in the absence of drug therapy. Although AVB resolution was less common in this setting, it could be concluded that improvement in AV conduction upon cessation of medications is often coincidental. Challenging the prevailing belief, this study demonstrated that true drug‐induced AVB is rare, as only 15% of patients with drug‐related AVB had AVB directly attributable to the medications, defined as AVB that resolved after drug discontinuation and did not recur during the 3‐week follow‐up period. Furthermore, it was shown that AV nodal block during drug therapy is a poor predictor of causation.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan PM) [^113Kqp5M]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiologic Effects: Electrical activity through the AV node depends, to a significant degree, upon the transmembrane influx of extracellular calcium through the L-type (slow) channel. By decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate-related manner.

Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with sick sinus syndrome, verapamil may interfere with sinus-node impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block. Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without pre-existing conduction defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Verapamil does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization, and conduction in depressed atrial fibers. Verapamil may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory bypass tract. Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Verapamil has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man.

Hemodynamics: Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility. In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by reduction of afterload and cardiac index remains unchanged. During isometric or dynamic exercise, verapamil does not alter systolic cardiac function in patients with normal ventricular function. In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mm Hg or ejection fraction less than 30%), or in patients taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents or other cardiodepressant drugs, deterioration of ventricular function may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Pulmonary Function: Verapamil does not induce bronchoconstriction and, hence, does not impair ventilatory function.

Verapamil has been shown to have either a neutral or relaxant effect on bronchial smooth muscle.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers. The systemic concentrations of R and S enantiomers, as well as overall bioavailability, are dependent upon the route of administration and the rate and extent of release from the dosage forms. Upon oral administration, there is rapid stereoselective biotransformation during the first pass of verapamil through the portal circulation.

OVERDOSAGE:

Treatment of overdosage should be supportive and individualized. Beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or parenteral administration of calcium solutions may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel, and have been effectively used in treatment of deliberate overdosage with oral Verapamil HCI. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high degree AV block should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures including isoproterenol hydrochloride, other vasopressor agents or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (see Treatment of Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions.)

3 Critical Analysis of Current Evidence and Management of Patients With Drug‐Related Atrioventricular Block

Current evidence suggests that drug‐related AVB is a common clinical problem in the elderly. However, true drug‐induced AVB seems to be rare. Despite the initial resolution of AVB following drug discontinuation, it is convincingly reported that the rates of recurrence and the necessity for permanent pacing are remarkably high. This trend appears to be evident even in patients receiving high doses of bradycardic or antiarrhythmic medications, those on drug combinations, and those with additional reversible factors such as hyperkalemia. Nevertheless, drugs, metabolic disturbances, or a combination of them seem to unmask the presence of severe underlying conduction system disease, indicating that early intervention with permanent pacing may be advisable.

Β‐blockers and non‐DHP CCBs exert their negative dromotropic effects primarily at the level of the AV node. Neither β‐blockers nor non‐DHP CCBs significantly affect conduction in the His‐Purkinje system. Similarly, digoxin slows conduction in the AV node but, at therapeutic levels, has minimal effects on the His‐Purkinje system. Bearing in mind that these medications primarily slow the sinus rate and conduction at the AV node, they are expected to prevent, not provoke, conduction block in the more distal (infranodal) parts of the conduction system. Therefore, when second‐ or third‐degree AVB occurs during therapy with β‐blockers, non‐DHP CCBs, or digoxin, it suggests that the underlying infranodal conduction disease is likely severe and may eventually progress to a permanent disturbance. Furthermore, patients with intermittent infrahisian block may also present with concomitant typical nodal AVB, which can be influenced by a transient, contributing factor and may resolve following its discontinuation. As is very well known, complete AVB does not necessarily imply an infranodal origin, and it is often difficult to distinguish nodal from infranodal AVB using surface ECG alone, particularly when these conditions coexist. Additionally, infranodal Wenckebach block may also be encountered. Moreover, in cases of nodal AVB, progression to infranodal disease may occur over time. The timeline of AVB recurrence after apparent resolution could help inform clinical decision‐making. However, the available studies have varying follow‐up durations, and only two have reported recurrence intervals, with a median of 65 days in one and a mean of 9 months in the other. These findings suggest that AVB tends to recur within months after resolution following drug discontinuation, but more data are needed to clearly define its recurrence patterns and natural history.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with interfascicular reentrant VT, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation in patients with verapamil-sensitive, idiopathic left VT related to interfascicular reentry, if antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (isoptin SR) [^1112zyfd]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Accessory Bypass Tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine): Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the AV node, producing a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving oral verapamil may be at risk and its use in these patients is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after oral ISOPTIN.

Atrioventricular Block: The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may cause asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR interval prolongation is correlated with verapamil plasma concentrations, especially during the early titration phases of therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%) observed. Marked first degree block or progressive development to second-or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances, discontinuation of verapamil HCI and institution of appropriate therapy depending upon the clinical situation.

Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (IHSS): In 120 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most of them refractory or intolerant to propranolol) who received therapy with verapamil at doses up to 720 mg/day, a variety of serious adverse effects were seen. Three patients died in pulmonary edema; all had severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and a past history of left ventricular dysfunction. Eight other patients had pulmonary edema and/or severe hypotension; abnormally high (greater than 20 mmHg) pulmonary wedge pressure and a marked left ventricular outflow obstruction were present in most of these patients. Concomitant administration of quinidine (see DRUG INTERACTIONS) preceded the severe hypotension in 3 of the 8 patients (2 of whom developed pulmonary edema). Sinus bradycardia occurred in 11% of the patients, second-degree AV block in 4% and sinus arrest in 2%. It must be appreciated that this group of patients had a serious disease with a high mortality rate. Most adverse effects responded well to dose reduction and only rarely did verapamil have to be discontinued.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^112d2Lyo]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Concomitant Antiarrhythmic Therapy:

Digitalis: Intravenous verapamil has been used concomitantly with digitalis preparations without the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, since both drugs slow AV conduction, patients should be monitored for AV block or excessive bradycardia.

Procainamide: Intravenous verapamil has been administered to a small number of patients receiving oral procainamide without the occurrence of serious adverse effects.

Quinidine: Intravenous verapamil has been administered to a small number of patients receiving oral quinidine without the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, three patients have been described in whom the combination resulted in an exaggerated hypotensive response presumably from the combined ability of both drugs to antagonize the effects of catecholamines on α-adrenergic receptors. Caution should therefore be used when employing this combination of drugs.

Beta Adrenergic Blocking Drugs: Intravenous verapamil has been administered to patients receiving oral beta blockers without the development of serious adverse effects. However, since both drugs may depress myocardial contractility and AV conduction, the possibility of detrimental interactions should be considered. The concomitant administration of intravenous beta blockers and intravenous verapamil has resulted in serious adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS), especially in patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure or recent myocardial infarction.

Disopyramide: Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and all forms of disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration.

Flecainide: A study in healthy volunteers showed that the concomitant administration of flecainide and verapamil may have additive effects reducing myocardial contractility, prolonging AV conduction, and prolonging repolarization.

Heart Block: Verapamil prolongs AV conduction time. While high degree AV block has not been observed in controlled clinical trials in the U.S., a low percentage (less than 0.5%) has been reported in the world literature. Development of second- or third-degree AV block or unifascicular, bifascicular or trifascicular bundle branch block requires reduction in subsequent doses or discontinuation of verapamil and institution of appropriate therapy, if needed. (See Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions).

### Fascicular tachycardia in infancy and the use of verapamil: a case series and literature review [^116GEqye]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) is also known as verapamil-sensitive VT because it is uniquely sensitive to verapamil, and will not be cardioverted by other antiarrhythmics.
Features of fascicular VT are: right bundle branch block, superior or right axis deviation, ventriculoatrial dissociation (sometimes) with fusion or capture beats.
Guidelines state that intravenous verapamil is contraindicated in infants due to fear of cardiovascular collapse with a rapid intravenous push.

What this study adds?

This report reminds us that fascicular VT is different from supraventricular tachycardia and requires different management irrespective of age.
Verapamil is effective in terminating fascicular VT and can be used safely in young children, including infants with preserved ventricular function when infused slowly with careful monitoring — this is particularly important if tachycardia has been ongoing for a long time and there is suspicion of depressed myocardial function — we propose infusion of 0.1 mg/kg over at least 10 min.
Calcium should be available at the bedside and concomitant use of atrioventricular blocking agents like beta blockers or digoxin should be avoided.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^115scyD5]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

The development of advanced atrioventricular block (AVB) in patients on bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic therapy (drug‐related AVB) represents a clinical challenge, raising the question of whether the AVB is directly caused by these agents (drug‐induced AVB) or if the offending drugs exacerbate an underlying conduction system disease. Traditionally, β‐blockers, non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of advanced AVB. However, recent evidence shows a weak cause‐and‐effect relationship between these drugs and AVB in the elderly, along with high recurrence rates of AVB despite initial resolution after drug discontinuation. This may also apply to patients on high doses of these medications, drug combinations, or with additional reversible factors such as hyperkalemia. Despite these considerations, the European Guidelines do not suggest permanent pacing for AVB due to transient causes that are correctable, including bradycardic/antiarrhythmic drug therapy. On the other hand, the American Guidelines recommend permanent pacing for selected patients with symptomatic second‐ or third‐degree AVB who are on stable, necessary antiarrhythmic or β‐blocker treatment, without waiting for drug washout or reversibility. Notably, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that true drug‐induced AVB is rare, while recurrence rates are high. Therefore, early permanent pacing should be recommended, especially for frail elderly patients. Moreover, in patients with drug‐related AVB and atrial tachyarrhythmias, adopting an early permanent pacing approach seems prudent when bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary. Finally, delays in permanent pacing are not justified when temporary pacing is needed, given the increased associated risks in such cases.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^113wGAbk]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Intravenous Verapamil HCI is contraindicated in:

Severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.
Second- or third-degree AV block (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker).
Sick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker).
Severe congestive heart failure (unless secondary to a supraventricular tachycardia amenable to verapamil therapy.)
Patients receiving intravenous beta adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., propranolol). Intravenous verapamil and intravenous beta adrenergic blocking drugs should not be administered in close proximity to each other (within a few hours), since both may have a depressant effect on myocardial contractility and AV conduction.
Patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory bypass tract (i.e. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndromes) are at risk to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmia including ventricular fibrillation if verapamil is administered. Therefore, the use of verapamil in these patients is contraindicated.
Ventricular Tachycardia. Administration of intravenous verapamil to patients with wide-complex ventricular-tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 sec) can result in marked hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. Proper pretherapy diagnosis and differentiation from wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia is imperative in the emergency room setting.
Known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochloride.

Supraventricular tachycardia differentiation with wide QRS — if the QRS duration is > 120 ms, it is crucial to distinguish ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction, pre-existing bundle-branch block, or pre-excitation, and administration of verapamil or diltiazem for treatment of either ventricular tachycardia or a pre-excited atrial fibrillation may lead to hemodynamic compromise or may accelerate the ventricular rate and lead to ventricular fibrillation.

Elevated Liver Enzymes/Hepatic Failure

Verapamil Component

Elevations of transaminases with and without concomitant elevations in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin have been reported. Such elevations have sometimes been transient and may disappear even in the face of continued verapamil treatment. Several cases of hepatocellular injury related to verapamil have been proven by rechallenge; half of these had clinical symptoms (malaise, fever, and/or right upper quadrant pain) in addition to elevations of SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase.

Trandolapril Component

ACE inhibitors rarely have been associated with a syndrome of cholestatic jaundice, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

Liver abnormalities were noted in 3.2% of patients taking any of several combinations of trandolapril/verapamil doses. Periodic monitoring of liver function in patients taking trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride extended-release tablets is therefore prudent.

Accessory Bypass Tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndromes)

Verapamil Component

Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the AV node, producing a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving oral verapamil may be at risk and its use in these patients is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after oral verapamil.

The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may lead to asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR interval prolongation is correlated with verapamil plasma concentrations, especially during the early titration phases of therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%) observed. Marked first-degree block or progressive development to second- or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances, discontinuation of verapamil hydrochloride and institution of appropriate therapy depending upon the clinical situation.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) [^1171d95D]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Verelan is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker
or calcium ion antagonist) which exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating
the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth
muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.

Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected by verapamil HCl. However in
patients with sick sinus syndrome, verapamil HCl may interfere with sinus node
impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block.
Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without preexisting conduction
defects. (See WARNINGS.) Verapamil
HCl does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular
conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization and
conduction in depressed atrial fibers. Verapamil HCl may shorten the antegrade
effective refractory period of accessory bypass tracts. Acceleration of
ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients
with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway
following administration of verapamil. (See WARNINGS.)

Verapamil HCl has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of
procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important
at the doses used in man.

Mechanism of Action

Essential Hypertension

Verapamil HCl exerts antihypertensive effects by decreasing
systemic vascular resistance, usually without orthostatic decreases in blood
pressure or reflex tachycardia; bradycardia (rate less than 50 beats/minute is
uncommon). Verapamil HCl regularly reduces arterial pressure at rest and at a
given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing the total
peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works.

Atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) with preexcitation syndromes — Conduction over an accessory pathway during AF can cause dangerously rapid ventricular responses and, in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation with risk of death; intravenous digitalis, verapamil, or diltiazem do not block the accessory pathway and may accelerate ventricular rate, and "these agents are contraindicated in this situation", while "caution should be exercised" with beta blockers in AF associated with preexcitation.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

### Compound cardiac toxicity of oral erythromycin and verapamil [^115XZXU7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of complete atrioventricular (AV) block and QTc prolongation following coadministration of high-dose verapamil and erythromycin.

Case Summary

A 79-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital due to extreme fatigue and dizziness. On admission, heart rate was 40 beats/min and blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg. An electrocardiogram showed complete atrioventricular (AV) block, escape rhythm of 50 beats/min, and QTc prolongation 583 msec. This event was attributed to concomitant treatment with verapamil 480 mg/d and erythromycin 2,000 mg/d, which was prescribed one week before admission.

Discussion

This is the first case published describing complete AV block and prolongation of QTc following coadministration of erythromycin and verapamil. CYP3A4 is the main isoenzyme responsible for metabolism of erythromycin and verapamil. Both drugs are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and of P-glycoprotein; this may be the basis for the pharmacokinetic interaction between erythromycin and verapamil. In addition to being a woman, our patient had other risk factors for QT prolongation: slow baseline heart rate (probably induced by verapamil), left-ventricular hypertrophy, and possibly ischemic heart disease.

Conclusions

This life-threatening arrhythmia was probably the result of a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction of high-dose verapamil and erythromycin.

### Drug-induced atrioventricular block: prognosis after discontinuation of the culprit drug [^116vPpDJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to determine how often atrioventricular (AV) block is really caused by medications.

Background

Beta-blockers, verapamil, and diltiazem are considered a cause of AV block for which pacemaker implantation is not indicated. However, it is not known if such patients can expect a benign course after discontinuation of the culprit medication.

Methods

Consecutive patients with II or III degree AV block not related to acute myocardial infarction, digitalis toxicity, or vasovagal syncope were studied. The level of AV block (AV-nodal or infranodal) was defined by electrocardiographic criteria. The cause and effect relation between AV block and drugs was defined according to the response to drug discontinuation.

Results

Of 169 patients with AV block, 92 (54%) were receiving beta-blockers and/or verapamil or diltiazem. Patients receiving medications had similar clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics with patients who had AV block in the absence of drugs. Drug discontinuation was followed by resolution of AV block in 41% of cases, whereas spontaneous improvement of AV conduction occurred in 23% of patients who had AV block in the absence of drugs. However, 56% of the patients for whom drug discontinuation led to resolution of AV block had recurrence of AV block in the absence of therapy. Atrioventricular block that was "truly caused by drugs" was found in only 15% of patients who had II or III degree AV block during therapy with beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem.

Conclusions

Atrioventricular block is commonly "related to drugs" but is rarely "caused by drugs".

### Diltiazem hci [^117GJMKM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

OVERDOSAGE

Treatment of overdosage should be supportive and individualized. Beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or parenteral administration of calcium solutions (calcium chloride) have been effectively used in treatment of deliberate overdosage with oral Verapamil. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high-degree AV block should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures including isoproterenol hydrochloride, other vasopressor agents, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS- Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions).

### Verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) [^117VtVvL]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Accessory Bypass Tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or
Lown-Ganong- Levine)

Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial flutter or
atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed
increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the AV
node, producing a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation
after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this
occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving
oral verapamil may be at risk and its use in these patients is contraindicated.
(See CONTRAINDICATIONS.)

Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and
effectively after oral verapamil.

Atrioventricular Block

The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may lead
to asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes
accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR interval prolongation is correlated with
verapamil plasma concentrations, especially during the early titration phase of
therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%)
observed.

Marked first-degree block or progressive development to second- or
third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances,
discontinuation of verapamil HCl and institution of appropriate therapy
depending upon the clinical situation.

Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (IHSS)

In 120 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most of them
refractory or intolerant to propranolol) who received therapy with verapamil at
doses up to 720 mg/day, a variety of serious adverse effects were seen. Three
patients died in pulmonary edema; all had severe left ventricular outflow
obstruction and a past history of left ventricular dysfunction. Eight other
patients had pulmonary edema and/or severe hypotension; abnormally high (over 20
mm Hg) capillary wedge pressure and a marked left ventricular outflow
obstruction were present in most of these patients. Concomitant administration
of quinidine (see Drug Interactions)
preceded the severe hypotension in 3 of the 8 patients (2 of whom developed
pulmonary edema). Sinus bradycardia occurred in 11% of the patients,
second-degree AV block in 4% and sinus arrest in 2%. It must be appreciated that
this group of patients had a serious disease with a high mortality rate. Most
adverse effects responded well to dose reduction and only rarely did verapamil
have to be discontinued.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Sodium channel–blocking drugs — management and risks — should not be used in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to structural heart disease; rather, the major indication is atrial arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease, and when used for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrioventricular (AV) nodal–blocking drugs should be administered to prevent rapid ventricular rates should atrial flutter occur, with amiodarone as a possible exception. These agents can convert AF to slow atrial flutter with 1:1 AV conduction and wide-QRS complexes and can occasionally precipitate a typical Brugada syndrome ECG; they also increase defibrillation energy requirement and pacing thresholds, sometimes necessitating reprogramming or revision of pacing or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) systems. The extent to which the prohibition in structural heart disease applies to tricyclic antidepressants that also block sodium channels is stated to be unknown.

### A randomized controlled trial of R-form verapamil added to ongoing metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111r8iMG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although verapamil is a drug of choice for the treatment of the cardiovascular diseases, adverse effects such as bradycardia and hypotension may occur under high dose. Several side effects were reported in the clinical trials of orally administered verapamil. The most serious adverse reactions reported with verapamil were heart failure, atrioventricular block, hypotension, and rapid ventricular response. Literature reports indicated that the R and S enantiomers had differing levels of pharmacologic activity. In contrast to the R-form, the S-form of verapamil demonstrated 8- to 20-fold higher potency to slow atrioventricular conduction and 15- to 50-fold higher potency to reduce myocardial contractility in animals and humans.

Based on the above-mentioned evidence, R-form verapamil is likely to reverse beta cell apoptosis and T2DM progression, with higher cardiovascular safety margin compared with S-form verapamil and racemic products. An oral formulation of R-form verapamil (R-Vera) is under development by Center Laboratories, Inc. as a potential treatment for patients with T2DM. The proposed investigational clinical trial is a dose-finding, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R-Vera in combination with metformin in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111u4sWJ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) — acute and longer-term management: During an acute episode of preexcited AF with rapid ventricular response and hemodynamic instability, electrical cardioversion must be used to restore sinus rhythm. Pathway ablation has well-established efficacy and safety for those with preexcited AF with a high success rate (93%-95%), and electrophysiological study and accessory pathway (AP) ablation can be offered as first-line therapy. Pharmacological options that increase the refractory period of atrial tissue (ibutilide or procainamide) can slow AP conduction and terminate AF; in 1 study involving 22 patients, ibutilide terminated AF in 21 patients and prolonged refractoriness of the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, and AP, and hemodynamically stable patients with preexcited AF can be pharmacologically managed with such agents. Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents can increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) by accelerating AP conduction; in a study of patients with WPW given verapamil during electrophysiological study, 2 patients deteriorated and required cardioversion, and because other safer options are readily available, atrioventricular nodal agents are best avoided in this setting.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113vjRT7]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.

### Fascicular tachycardia in infancy and the use of verapamil: a case series and literature review [^113pm9Va]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Guidelines state that verapamil is contraindicated in infants. This is based on reports of cardiovascular collapse and even death after rapid intravenous administration of verapamil in infants with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). We wish to challenge this contraindication for the specific indication of verapamil sensitive ventricular tachycardia (VSVT) in infants.

Design

Retrospective case series and critical literature review.

Setting

Hospitals within New Zealand.

Patients

We present a series of three infants/young children with VSVT or 'fascicular VT'.

Results

Three children aged between 8 days and 2 years presented with tachycardia 200–220 beats per minute with right bundle brunch block and superior axis. Adenosine failed to cardiovert and specialist review diagnosed VSVT. There were no features of cardiovascular shock. Verapamil was given as a slow infusion over 10–30min (rather than as a push) and each successfully cardioverted without incident. Critical review of the literature reveals that cardiovascular collapses were associated with a rapid intravenous push in cardiovascularly compromised infants and/or infants given other long-acting antiarrhythmics prior to verapamil.

Conclusions

Verapamil is specifically indicated for the treatment of fascicular VT, and for this indication should be used in infancy, as well as in older children, as first-line treatment or after failure of adenosine raises suspicion of the diagnosis. We outline how to distinguish this tachycardia from SVT and propose a strategy for the safe intravenous slow infusion of verapamil in children, noting that extreme caution is necessary with pre-existing ventricular dysfunction.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^111hFT1U]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The development of advanced atrioventricular block (AVB) in patients on bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic therapy (drug-related AVB) represents a clinical challenge, raising the question of whether the AVB is directly caused by these agents (drug-induced AVB) or if the offending drugs exacerbate an underlying conduction system disease. Traditionally, β-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of advanced AVB. However, recent evidence shows a weak cause-and-effect relationship between these drugs and AVB in the elderly, along with high recurrence rates of AVB despite initial resolution after drug discontinuation. This may also apply to patients on high doses of these medications, drug combinations, or with additional reversible factors such as hyperkalemia. Despite these considerations, the European Guidelines do not suggest permanent pacing for AVB due to transient causes that are correctable, including bradycardic/antiarrhythmic drug therapy. On the other hand, the American Guidelines recommend permanent pacing for selected patients with symptomatic second- or third-degree AVB who are on stable, necessary antiarrhythmic or β-blocker treatment, without waiting for drug washout or reversibility. Notably, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that true drug-induced AVB is rare, while recurrence rates are high. Therefore, early permanent pacing should be recommended, especially for frail elderly patients. Moreover, in patients with drug-related AVB and atrial tachyarrhythmias, adopting an early permanent pacing approach seems prudent when bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary. Finally, delays in permanent pacing are not justified when temporary pacing is needed, given the increased associated risks in such cases.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^112hdstt]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Conclusions

Drug‐related AVB represents a common clinical problem in the elderly, even though true drug‐induced AVB is rare. Despite initial recovery after discontinuing the offending medications, recurrence rates are notably high, very often leading to permanent pacemaker implantation. This trend seems to hold even for patients on high doses of bradycardic or antiarrhythmic drugs, those on drug combinations, and those with additional reversible factors such as hyperkalemia. Based on these findings, early consideration for permanent pacemaker implantation may be a prudent strategy in all frail elderly patients with drug‐related AVB. Moreover, given the high need for backup pacing in patients with drug‐related AV block and atrial tachyarrhythmias when antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary, an early permanent pacing approach is recommended. Additionally, in cases where temporary pacing is necessary, immediate placement of a permanent pacemaker may reduce complications and improve clinical outcomes. Undoubtedly, further research may identify reliable predictors that can guide clinical decision‐making in the setting of drug‐related and/or hyperkalemia‐related AVB.

Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (LVT) — catheter ablation and medical therapy outcomes indicate that catheter ablation is acutely successful in > 90% of patients with a risk of recurrence of approximately 10%, with serious complications infrequent and including bleeding at the site of arterial or venous access and a small risk of bundle branch block or atrioventricular block; although no RCTs have been published, the chronic use of oral verapamil for verapamil-sensitive idiopathic LVT has been reported to control this tachycardia in many patients, including both adults and children.

### Verapamil in infants: an exaggerated fear? [^1171Vwxc]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The use of intravenous verapamil for tachyarrhythmia in infants is widely considered contraindicated due to the perceived risk of hemodynamic collapse after administration. This article reviews the relatively limited evidence that led to this well-known contraindication and highlights the interesting process by which medical practice may evolve in the absence of persuasive science.

Digoxin in acute decompensation and conduction disease — contraindications and cautions specify that digoxin is not indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with an acute exacerbation of HF symptoms, including fluid retention or hypotension, and such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF (usually with intravenous medications); therapy with digoxin may be initiated after stabilization as part of an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. Patients should not be given digoxin if they have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been addressed with a permanent pacemaker, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients taking other drugs that can depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function or affect digoxin levels (e.g., amiodarone or a beta-blocker).

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1171E38h]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Contraindications regarding the use of verapamil hydrochloride PO:
- **Second- or third-degree AV block**: do not use verapamil in patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.
- **Sick sinus syndrome**: do not use verapamil in patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.
- **WPW syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome**: do not use verapamil in patients with AF or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract, such as in WPW syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular (AV) block — transient/potentially reversible causes specify that in patients with symptomatic atrioventricular block attributable to a known reversible cause in whom the atrioventricular block does not resolve despite treatment of the underlying cause, permanent pacing is recommended; in patients who had acute atrioventricular block attributable to a known reversible and non-recurrent cause, and have had complete resolution of the atrioventricular block with treatment of the underlying cause, permanent pacing should not be performed; and in patients with asymptomatic vagally mediated atrioventricular block, permanent pacing should not be performed.

### Verapamil hydrochloride SR [^1174Npv4]. FDA. Low credibility.

Contraindications regarding the use of verapamil hydrochloride SR PO (also known as Verelan, Calan SR):
- **Second- or third-degree AV block**: do not use verapamil in patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.
- **Sick sinus syndrome**: do not use verapamil in patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.
- **WPW syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome**: do not use verapamil in patients with AF or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract, such as in WPW syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome.
