## Question

Can dementia cause visual and/or auditory hallucinations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if dementia can cause visual and/or auditory hallucinations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which dementia syndromes most strongly associate with hallucinations. Then, I should verify prevalence patterns across modalities and diseases. Next, I will examine neuropathological and network mechanisms. After that, I should consider diagnostic weight and phenomenology. Finally, I will review management implications and acknowledge limitations before synthesizing an answer [^116bMH98] [^113tvv4f].

> Let me first confirm the central point: yes, dementia can cause both visual and auditory hallucinations, but the likelihood and phenomenology are disease-specific, with Lewy body dementias showing the strongest association, whereas Alzheimer's disease generally shows lower rates and often mixed-pathology contributors rather than "pure AD" causes of hallucinations [^116Rz9XX] [^113tvv4f].

> I need to check the comparative prevalence data carefully. Hold on, meta-analytic estimates show visual hallucinations are highly prevalent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and present to a lesser degree in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD): pooled VH prevalence ~61.8% in DLB and ~28.2% in PD, while broad comparative reviews place DLB VH roughly 50–70% and AD at much lower rates, often in the 7–35% range with means near ~13% in many series [^116bMH98] [^113tvv4f] [^113EThNE] [^116hv2iG].

> Wait, let me verify auditory hallucination data before drawing conclusions. The same high-quality meta-analysis estimates AH prevalence ~30.8% in DLB and ~8.9% in PD, and phenomenology studies in DLB show that most patients with AH also have VH and often describe AH as an external "soundtrack" accompanying visual scenes, implying polymodal experiences in Lewy body disease rather than isolated auditory phenomena [^116bMH98] [^116Vr69U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity. I initially thought visual hallucinations were pathognomonic for Lewy body disease, but wait, that's too strong; VH occur in AD and other conditions, though they are a core clinical feature in DLB criteria and are diagnostically helpful when present early and persistently, especially compared with atypical parkinsonism syndromes where VH are relatively uncommon [^116DjXGg] [^114j9eBQ] [^113EThNE].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure I'm not oversimplifying. Evidence points to α‑synuclein Lewy pathology involving higher-order visual networks and hubs: the pulvinar nucleus shows both pathologic involvement and network-level molecular changes, secondary visual pathways and the amygdaloid–visual interfaces are preferentially affected over primary visual cortex, and even retinal changes have been described, all plausibly converging on impaired visual attention, salience, and visuo-limbic integration that foster hallucinations in DLB/PDD [^113Zowo2] [^1124Hojs] [^112xkNAk] [^113ipid4].

> But wait, what about Alzheimer's disease mechanisms; do they mirror this pattern? I should confirm that hallucinations in AD commonly reflect mixed pathology rather than "pure AD" drivers; indeed, clinicopathologic series link psychosis in clinically labeled AD to coexistent Lewy bodies and small vessel white matter disease, suggesting that when hallucinations appear in AD, they often index underlying synucleinopathy or vascular contributions more than hallmark AD lesions alone [^115nYcLx] [^113tvv4f].

> I will now examine clinical implications because diagnostic weight matters. Let me verify persistence and predictive value: VH are not only more frequent in DLB but also more persistent over time, and pareidolic illusions can be elicited and used as surrogate markers supporting Lewy body pathology; further, VH help in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism, being much less common in PSP, MSA, and CBS than in DLB or PD/PDD, thus offering practical diagnostic leverage at the bedside [^117PM4Td] [^1126TDNv] [^111HpzNY] [^114j9eBQ].

> Let me think about phenomenology next. Complex, well-formed images of people and animals dominate the visual content in DLB, whereas AH in Lewy body disease are most often verbal voices perceived as external, frequently co-occurring with VH; multimodal hallucinations do happen but, I should double-check, they are less often simultaneous and fully fused, aligning with observations that modalities can be dissociated in time or content [^114MbUpF] [^116Vr69U] [^1146jgJ8].

> Now, I should review treatment principles without overgeneralizing. Cholinesterase inhibitors are front-line in Lewy body dementias and can reduce VH and related illusions, with reports of donepezil decreasing pareidolia; conversely, antipsychotic sensitivity is a key hazard in DLB, mandating very cautious, low-dose use if needed and a preference for strategies that enhance cholinergic tone and optimize the sensory environment, while isolated reports suggest memantine may help some patients but evidence remains limited [^113rKzXY] [^112xkSnf] [^111GgpN7] [^114LJQS2] [^115eWvoL].

> Hold on, I should verify PD/PDD-specific measures too. Standard algorithms emphasize reviewing for delirium, medical precipitants, and visual/auditory impairments, then rationally reducing dopaminergic and anticholinergic medications most likely to worsen psychosis before considering antipsychotics, consistent with guideline-informed stepped care and the known neuroleptic sensitivity in Lewy body disease [^112tfnhk] [^111GgpN7].

> I need to ensure the evidence quality and caveats are transparent. Many individual studies are small and heterogeneous, but high-credibility syntheses provide robust prevalence anchors; misdiagnosis and under-reporting are common, especially in AD labeled cohorts where autopsy often reveals Lewy bodies, and stigma plus variable ascertainment tools can suppress observed rates, suggesting true prevalence may be higher than some clinic samples imply [^116bMH98] [^115nYcLx] [^1127BZkK] [^113tvv4f].

> Bringing this together, the self-check confirms the core answer: yes, dementia can cause visual and auditory hallucinations, with the highest likelihood and richest multimodal phenomenology in Lewy body dementias, substantially lower and often mixed-pathology–related rates in Alzheimer's disease, and mechanistic convergence on higher-order visual–attentional and limbic networks rather than primary sensory cortex alone; clinically, persistent complex VH, especially with pareidolias and DLB core features, should prompt evaluation for Lewy body disease and guide cholinergic-first, antipsychotic-sparing management strategies [^116bMH98] [^113tvv4f] [^116DjXGg].

Visual and auditory hallucinations are most strongly associated with **Lewy body dementia (DLB)**, where visual hallucinations are a core feature [^113rKzXY] and auditory hallucinations are also common [^116Vr69U] [^116bMH98]. Visual hallucinations can also occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but are **less frequent and typically appear later in the disease course** [^113EThNE] [^113tvv4f]. Hallucinations in DLB are linked to Lewy body pathology in visual and auditory pathways, cholinergic deficits, and network dysfunction involving the pulvinar [^1124Hojs] and visual association cortices [^112xkNAk] [^113Zowo2]. Management prioritizes cholinesterase inhibitors [^113rKzXY] and cautious use of antipsychotics due to severe sensitivity in DLB [^111GgpN7].

## Dementia with lewy bodies (DLB)

DLB is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, fluctuations in cognition, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) [^116DjXGg], and prominent visual hallucinations [^113rKzXY]. Visual hallucinations are a **core diagnostic feature**, occurring in approximately 70–80% of patients and often complex, well-formed, and recurrent [^113Zowo2] [^116bMH98] [^113tvv4f]. Auditory hallucinations are also common (approximately 30–40%) and frequently co-occur with visual hallucinations [^116Vr69U] [^116bMH98].

---

### Pathophysiology of hallucinations in DLB

Hallucinations in DLB are associated with Lewy body pathology in the visual and auditory pathways, including the secondary visual cortex, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus [^1124Hojs], and amygdala [^112xkNAk] [^113Zowo2]. Cholinergic deficits and **network dysfunction** involving the pulvinar and visual association cortices have been implicated in their pathogenesis [^114yvqFL] [^113Zowo2].

---

### Clinical implications

Hallucinations in DLB are associated with increased caregiver burden, earlier institutionalization, and poorer prognosis compared to other dementias [^111ZyfMV] [^113tvv4f]. Management of hallucinations in DLB is challenging due to **severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications**, which can exacerbate motor symptoms and increase mortality risk [^111GgpN7] [^1156uoCt]. Cholinesterase inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment for hallucinations in DLB, with cautious use of antipsychotics only when necessary [^113rKzXY].

---

## Alzheimer's disease (AD)

Visual hallucinations can occur in Alzheimer's disease, although they are **less frequent and typically appear later in the disease course** compared to DLB [^113EThNE]. The prevalence of visual hallucinations in AD varies widely, ranging from 7% to 35% [^113EThNE] [^113tvv4f]. Auditory hallucinations are less common in AD but can occur, particularly in advanced stages.

---

### Pathophysiology of hallucinations in AD

Hallucinations in AD are associated with greater cognitive and functional impairment and may be related to **co-existing Lewy body pathology** or vascular risk factors [^115nYcLx] [^113tvv4f]. They are also associated with more severe cognitive decline, earlier institutionalization, and increased mortality [^113EThNE].

---

### Clinical implications

Hallucinations in AD are associated with increased caregiver burden and poorer prognosis. Management typically involves careful assessment of underlying causes, including medication review and management of co-existing conditions [^114LJQS2]. Antipsychotic medications may be used cautiously but carry **significant risks**, including increased mortality and cognitive decline.

## Management strategies

Management of hallucinations in dementia involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions [^1117aCw5]. Pharmacological treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors, cautiously used antipsychotic medications, and agents such as memantine [^113rKzXY] [^111GgpN7]. Non-pharmacological interventions include **environmental modifications**, **caregiver education**, and **behavioral strategies** [^113nn619] [^114LJQS2].

### Clinical features of auditory hallucinations in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies: A soundtrack of visual hallucinations [^116Vr69U]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations are an important symptom for diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and have received less attention than visual hallucinations. We investigated the clinical features of auditory hallucinations and the possible mechanisms by which they arise in patients with DLB.

- **Methods**: We recruited 124 consecutive patients with probable DLB (diagnosis based on the DLB International Workshop 2005 criteria; study period: June 2007-January 2015) from the dementia referral center of Kumamoto University Hospital. We used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory to assess the presence of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. We reviewed all available clinical records of patients with auditory hallucinations to assess their clinical features. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis to identify significant independent predictors of auditory hallucinations.

- **Results**: Of the 124 patients, 44 (35.5%) had auditory hallucinations, and 75 (60.5%) had visual hallucinations. The majority of patients (90.9%) with auditory hallucinations also had visual hallucinations. Auditory hallucinations consisted mostly of human voices, and 90% of patients described them as like hearing a soundtrack of the scene. Multiple logistic regression showed that the presence of auditory hallucinations was significantly associated with female sex (P = 0.04) and hearing impairment (P = 0.004). The analysis also revealed independent correlations between the presence of auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations (P < .001).

### Specific patterns of neuronal loss in the pulvinar nucleus in dementia with Lewy bodies [^113Zowo2]. Movement disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Complex visual hallucinations occur in 70%-80% of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and significantly affect well-being. Despite their prevalence, the neuropathological basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus has not been previously neuropathologically examined but has been linked to visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies. The objective of this study was to investigate whether neuropathological or morphometric changes occur in the pulvinar nucleus in dementia with Lewy bodies cases that may contribute to visual hallucinations.

- **Methods**: Postmortem pulvinar tissue was acquired from 8 individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies, 8 with Alzheimer's disease, and 8 control cases. The tissue was analyzed using stereological and quantitative neuropathological techniques.

- **Results**: Lewy body pathology was present throughout the pulvinar in dementia with Lewy bodies but was most severe in the medial pulvinar. Neuronal loss was found in the lateral pulvinar in both dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, but it was more severe in those with dementia with Lewy bodies.

- **Conclusions**: The pulvinar plays an important role in visual attention, visual target selection, and affective visual perception. These functions are thought to be deficient in dementia with Lewy bodies and may contribute to a vulnerability to visual hallucinations. Therefore, this study has demonstrated neuropathological changes that may promote the manifestation of visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Understanding hallucinations in probable Alzheimer's disease: Very low prevalence rates in a tertiary memory clinic [^113EThNE]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Hallucinations occur in a variety of psychiatric, neurologic, and somatic disorders, as well as in the general population. Their presence can induce distress and impair daily functioning to a stage where professional help is necessary. A better understanding of hallucinations can improve both clinical assessment and treatment.

Reported prevalence rates of hallucinations in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) vary widely, from 7% to 35%, averaging at 13.4%. Their presence has been repeatedly associated with more severe cognitive and functional decline, earlier institutionalization, higher burden of disease, and increased mortality. It is, therefore, essential to better understand hallucinations in AD.

However, heterogeneity between studies on hallucinations in probable AD is large and complicates the comparability of study results. The literature is not conclusive on potentially contributive factors, such as dementia severity. Additionally, the possibility of other diagnoses and medication use as alternative contributing factors to hallucinations in patients with probable AD is often underexposed.

The present study tries to improve the understanding of these uncertainties by examining hallucinations in a large sample of patients with probable AD, derived from a tertiary research memory clinic specialized in the early detection of dementia. We assessed the prevalence and phenomenology of hallucinations and studied potentially associated factors by comparing hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients.

### Psychotropic and anti-dementia treatment in elderly persons with clinical signs of dementia with Lewy bodies: A cross-sectional study in 40 nursing homes in Sweden [^111GgpN7]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Elderly persons with a dementia diagnosis often suffer from different neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, irritability, and agitation. Currently, the medical treatment for NPS consists mostly of psychotropic medication, including hypnotics/sedatives, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics. In elderly persons with dementia, the use of antipsychotics is less appropriate due to the risk of side effects such as parkinsonism, rapid cognitive decline, cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality. Furthermore, elderly persons with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are often hypersensitive to antipsychotics, which can lead to numerous serious adverse events such as somnolence, sedation, extra-pyramidal symptoms, delirium, and increased mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the usage of psychotropics, focusing on antipsychotics and anti-dementia medication (according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System), in elderly persons with clinical signs of DLB living in dementia nursing homes (NHs) in Sweden.

- **Methods**: Between 2012 and 2013, we applied a specially designed questionnaire that covered the clinical DLB features according to the consensus criteria of DLB. We also collected computerized medical lists from the Swedish National Medication Dispensing System from the same period. All dementia NHs (n = 40) in Malmö, the third largest city in Sweden, were covered. Of 650 eligible residents, 610 (94%) were included with 576 medical lists. The mean age was 86 years, and 76% were women.

### Investigation of Lewy pathology in the visual pathway of brains of dementia with Lewy bodies [^112xkNAk]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

We examined 19 autopsied cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using pathological and alpha-synuclein-immunohistochemical methods. Our investigation focused on Lewy pathology in the primary visual pathway (lateral geniculate body and Brodmann's area 17), secondary visual pathway (pulvinar, Brodmann's areas 18 and 19, and inferior temporal cortex), amygdala, and substantia nigra. The aim was to clarify the relationship between visual misidentification and Lewy pathology in the visual pathway.

Consequently, the secondary visual pathway revealed significantly more severe Lewy pathology than the primary visual pathway, suggesting that degeneration of the secondary visual pathway induces dysfunction in the recognition of object's shape and color. Additionally, the amygdala showed significantly more severe Lewy pathology and neuronal loss than the primary and secondary visual pathways, indicating that degeneration of the amygdala, which receives afferent connections from the substantia nigra, fails to modulate visual processing according to cognition and emotion.

These findings suggest that Lewy pathologies in the secondary visual pathway and amygdala may cause dysfunction of the visuo-amygdaloid pathway, contributing to visual misidentification in DLB patients. Further comparison of Lewy pathology between cases with and without visual hallucinations showed no significant differences between the two groups.

### Diffuse Lewy body disease [^113rKzXY]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Low credibility.

Diffuse Lewy body disease, also called dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is defined as progressive dementia and pathological Lewy bodies distributed in the central and autonomic nervous systems. The clinical features are dementia, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Confirmatory techniques include dopamine transporter imaging, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, and polysomnography.

The pathology finding in DLB is misfolded alpha-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, propagating in the central nervous system. This may interrupt the acetylcholine pathway and activate an inflammatory response. Mutations of several genes have been found in patients with DLB, including SNCA, GBA, and APOE.

The differential diagnosis of DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) is a debated issue.

- **Diagnosis distinctions**: Clinical features distinguishing DLB from PDD include the timing of dementia and visual hallucinations, responses to dopaminergic agents and anti-psychotics, and imaging findings.

- **Management of DLB**: Cholinesterase inhibitors are the Level-A recommendation for treating dementia in DLB patients and are also beneficial for treating visual hallucinations and psychotic symptoms. Dopamine agonists have the risk of inducing psychotic symptoms, while levodopa should be used carefully for motor symptoms. Melatonin and clonazepam are effective in controlling RBD.

Several other treatment methods are undergoing trials, including pimavanserine, nilotinib, psychological interventions, and behavior therapy.

### Auditory and visual hallucination prevalence in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bMH98]. Psychological Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), such as auditory hallucinations (AH), contribute to disease burden but are not well understood.

- **Methods**: Systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses of studies reporting AH associated with PD or DLB. Prevalence of visual hallucinations (VH) in identified studies meeting eligibility criteria were included in meta-analyses, facilitating comparison with AH. Synthesis of qualitative descriptions of AH was performed. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for primary journal articles, written in English, published from 1970 to 2017. Studies reporting AH prevalence in PD or DLB were screened using PRISMA methods.

- **Results**: Searches identified 4542 unique studies for consideration, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. AH pooled prevalence in PD was estimated to be 8.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3–14.5], while in DLB, it was estimated to be 30.8% (± 23.4 to 39.3). Verbal hallucinations, perceived as originating outside the head, were the most common form of AH. Non-verbal AH were also common, while musical AH were rare. VH were more prevalent, with an estimated pooled prevalence in PD of 28.2% (± 19.1 to 39.5), while in DLB, they were estimated to be 61.8% (± 49.1 to 73.0). Meta-regression determined that the use of validated methodologies to identify hallucinations produced higher prevalence estimates.

- **Conclusions**: AH and VH present in a substantial proportion of PD and DLB cases, with VH reported more frequently in both conditions. Both AH and VH are more prevalent in these diseases.

### Pareidolias: Complex visual illusions in dementia with Lewy bodies [^1126TDNv]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

'A perception without an object' is the classic definition of a hallucination and has been in use since the end of the 19th century. According to this definition, a visual hallucination is experienced when one sees something where nothing actually exists. However, it is inevitable that when patients are awake and have their eyes open, they see things. It is difficult to determine whether false perceptions arise independently of real visual scenes or as a result of their distortion.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is arguably the most common cause of visual hallucinations in the elderly. Although visual hallucinations are one of the core clinical features differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies from other dementias, clinicians rarely witness patients as they experience them. Questionnaires or interviews with patients or caregivers are usually used to assess visual hallucinations. However, visual hallucinations are commonly under-reported by patients and are often not discovered by caregivers and health professionals. Tests that detect visual hallucinations directly from patients would thus be a helpful clinical tool.

Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies frequently experience a variety of visual illusions as well as visual hallucinations. Pareidolias, which are illusions of meaningful objects such as faces and animals, are thought to arise from ambiguous forms embedded in visual scenes and have a striking phenomenological resemblance to visual hallucinations. For instance, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies may incorrectly see a person in a curtain.

### Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: Pathophysiology and management [^1117aCw5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Although the clinical importance of visual hallucinations (VH) and related symptoms has long been recognized, the evidence base for their pathophysiology or treatment is limited and focuses on single conditions. A wider perspective is required, highlighting key similarities and differences between conditions and taking into account brain changes conferring susceptibility to such symptoms, as well as those coincident with their occurrence. In advance of such developments, the workgroup concluded that treatment of VH, irrespective of their clinical context, would benefit from a common management framework and shared priorities for future research.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^1146jgJ8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

In Lewy body disease (LBD) syndromes, psychosis is usually more intense than in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Hallucinations may be present in more than 80% of all patients, while systematized delusions might affect up to 55%. Dopaminergic therapy may increase these numbers, particularly regarding delusional jealousy. The prevalence of delusions and hallucinations tends to be dissociated; in AD, delusions are more common than hallucinations, whereas in LBD, hallucinations are more prevalent. While pareidolia is not unusual in LBD syndromes, one study showed that multimodal hallucinations are infrequent. Little more than 20% of those who presented visual hallucinations (VH) also had tactile and verbal auditory hallucinations, while less than 6% experienced olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. Persistent musical hallucinations, often religious and patriotic, are more common in LBD than in other dementia syndromes.

In LBD syndromes, patients with delusions and agitation usually have a higher frequency of VH. Complex VH are the most distinguishing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in mildly impaired patients. One cross-sectional study showed a point prevalence of 96% for complex VH in comparison with 71% in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and 28% in late-onset APOE ɛ3/ɛ3 AD. Additionally, psychosis is more prevalent in association with REM sleep behavior disorder.

Capgras delusions may occur in up to 10% of patients with DLB, but have not been described in PDD. However, paranoid delusions, such as delusions of theft and persecution, are more frequent than Capgras delusions in DLB. Fluctuating cognition and excessive daytime somnolence tend to cluster with hallucinations.

### Diffuse Lewy body disease - a clinical syndrome or a disease entity [^114JkdD9]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Most clinicians and researchers still accept diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) as a clinicopathological entity. Dementia with fluctuating cognitive deficits, a parkinsonian syndrome, and visual hallucinations are the core symptoms of this proposed disease entity. From a neuropathological point of view, many examples of patients with progressive dementia showing evidence of extensive Lewy body formation in the cerebral cortex together with the occurrence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus have been identified. Confusingly, a large majority of cases showing typical features of DLBD also present with Alzheimer pathology in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It is far from clear that DLBD represents a specific disease entity rather than an intermediate variant between Alzheimer disease and idiopathic parkinsonian syndromes. Nevertheless, from a clinical point of view, it may be important to characterize patients with a symptomatology of DLBD because important management issues, such as the avoidance of severe neuroleptic sensitivity reactions, the application of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian treatment, and a beneficial response to cholinesterase inhibitors, can be applied.

### Visual hallucinations in the psychosis spectrum and comparative information from neurodegenerative disorders and eye disease [^115pfisP]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Hallucinations are defined in different ways by different philosophical traditions. In the clinical domain, a visual hallucination (VH) is a visual percept experienced when awake, which is not elicited by an external stimulus. It contrasts with a visual illusion, which is elicited by an external stimulus but differs from the percept normally associated with the stimulus. VHs occur in a wide range of organic and psychiatric conditions, as well as in the absence of any demonstrable pathology. These experiences have been well described and researched in the context of organic disorders, particularly eye disease and neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, VHs have been largely neglected in psychiatric disorders, delirious states, and in nonclinical populations.

Although the diagnostic manuals for mental disorders list hallucinations as a primary characteristic symptom in psychotic disorders, auditory hallucinations are the symptoms clinicians commonly inquire about. One explanation for this may lie in the traditional belief that VHs are more common in organic states than in psychosis. It is often difficult to decide whether the full criteria for the presence of VHs have been fulfilled when a range of other perceptual abnormalities are reported.

In this article, we review the available evidence regarding the prevalence, phenomenology, clinical characteristics, and assessment methods for VHs in the psychosis spectrum, alongside studies of cognition, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and treatment.

### Visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism [^114j9eBQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations (VH) occur commonly in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but are reported much less frequently in other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration syndrome. This clinical sign may be helpful when considering the differential diagnosis of patients with parkinsonism. The observation that VH may be specific to Lewy body pathology probably reflects a greater vulnerability of the visual systems to PD and DLB neurodegeneration compared with other diseases.

Topographic differences in pathology are probably the major factor producing VH in Lewy body diseases, rather than neurophysiological changes that are specific to α-synuclein protein accumulation. VH correlate with pathology in the limbic system and more specifically the amygdala, which is frequently affected in PD and DLB but relatively preserved in other forms of parkinsonism often misdiagnosed as PD. In this review, the published frequencies of VH in these different conditions are compared to put into context the notion of VH as a clinical clue to underlying Lewy body pathology.

### Auditory and visual hallucination prevalence in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zR2Jz]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), such as auditory hallucinations (AH), contribute to disease burden but are not well understood.

- **Methods**: Systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses of studies reporting AH associated with PD or DLB. Prevalence of visual hallucinations (VH) in identified studies meeting eligibility criteria were included in meta-analyses, facilitating comparison with AH.

VH were more prevalent, with an estimated pooled prevalence in PD of 28.2% (± 19.1 to 39.5), while in DLB, they were estimated to be 61.8% (± 49.1 to 73.0). Meta-regression determined that the use of validated methodologies to identify hallucinations produced higher prevalence estimates.

- **Conclusions**: AH and VH present in a substantial proportion of PD and DLB cases, with VH reported more frequently in both conditions. Both AH and VH are more prevalent.

### Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management [^114LJQS2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are common in older people and are especially associated with ophthalmological and neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson's disease. Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat.

The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research program to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high-burden areas of eye disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. This effort culminated in a workshop aimed at developing a unified framework for their clinical management. Here, we summarize the evidence base, practice, and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.

- **Case ascertainment strategies**: Irrespective of clinical condition, these strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive, and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided.

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Not all hallucinations require intervention, but for those that are clinically significant, evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic, or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability.

A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include developing more robust clinical trial evidence.

### Lewy bodies, vascular risk factors, and subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy, but not Alzheimer pathology, are associated with development of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease [^115nYcLx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The neuropathological correlates of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear, with some studies reporting a correlation between psychosis and increased AD pathology, while others have found no association.

- **Objective**: To determine the demographic, clinical, and neuropathological features associated with psychotic symptoms in clinically attributed and neuropathologically proven AD.

- **Method**: We separately reviewed two overlapping groups of clinically diagnosed (cAD) AD patients with neuropathology data and neuropathologically definite (npAD) cases (regardless of clinical diagnosis) from the NACC database. We explored the relationships between psychosis and clinical variables, neuropathologic correlates, and vascular risk factors. Delusions and hallucinations, defined according to the NPI-Q, were analyzed separately.

- **Results**: A total of 1,073 subjects in the database fulfilled our criteria (890 cAD and 728 npAD patients). 34% of cAD and 37% of npAD had psychotic symptoms during their illness. Hallucinations were associated with greater cognitive and functional impairments on the MMSE and CDR, while delusional patients showed less impairment on CDR, consistent across cAD and npAD groups. The burden of AD pathology appears to relate to the presence of psychotic symptoms in the clinical AD group, but this result is not confirmed in the neuropathologically confirmed group, suggesting that the findings in the clinical group were due to misdiagnosis of AD. Lewy body pathology, subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy, and vascular risk factors, including a history of hypertension, were associated with psychosis.

### On visual hallucinations and cortical networks: A trans-diagnostic review [^116hv2iG]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are the most common hallucination modality in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with an estimated prevalence of 13%. Alongside other psychotic features in Alzheimer's disease, they precipitate admission to psychiatric hospitals and nursing home placement. As with Parkinson's disease, they are linked to more rapid cognitive decline and worse overall prognosis. In Alzheimer's disease, patients typically hallucinate people, animals, insects, and objects.

- **Methodological issues**: As with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, visual hallucinations are the most common modality hallucinated. However, in these conditions, visual hallucinations co-occur with other modalities, delusions, and a loss of insight. They are also associated with greater cognitive decline, all of which may contribute to the cortical changes identified.

- **Structural imaging findings**:
	- Holroyd et al. — Investigated Alzheimer's disease with (N = 7) and without (N = 7) visual hallucinations, matched for cognitive score. They found that patients with visual hallucinations had significantly smaller occipital lobes, controlling for whole-brain volume.
	- Middlekoop et al. — Studied Alzheimer's disease with (N = 3) and without (N = 22) visual hallucinations. They did not find significant differences in occipital lobe volume (controlling for whole-brain volume) in an ANOVA model, which included the dementia with Lewy bodies group described above. As with dementia with Lewy bodies, the trend found was in the opposite direction to that expected, with larger occipital volume in hallucinators compared to non-hallucinators.

### The effects of memantine on a patient having preclinical dementia with Lewy bodies [^115eWvoL]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Memantine has been reported to have positive effects on visual hallucinations and cognition in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We hypothesized that memantine would have similar effects on a patient having Charles Bonnet syndrome, preclinical DLB.

- **Method**: We evaluated the effect of memantine on visual hallucination and cognitive abilities from baseline to 4 months after the start of medication.

- **Results**: Treatment of the patient with memantine resulted in the disappearance of visual hallucinations but could not stop the progression to dementia.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggested that, for a patient having preclinical DLB, memantine had some degree of positive effects, but the mechanism remains to be revealed.

### Visual hallucinations: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116Rz9XX]. Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). High credibility.

Visual hallucinations can arise from a variety of causes. These include substance-induced psychosis, bipolar disorder, delirium, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Parkinson's disease, recreational drug use, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Additional causes encompass migraine with aura, brain tumors, brain metastasis, sleep deprivation, narcolepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.

Furthermore, various medications can induce visual hallucinations. These medications include tizanidine, benztropine, bromocriptine, moexipril, sulindac, benzonatate, lamotrigine, prucalopride, and lamotrigine XR.

### Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review [^112m6Jr8]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

The review was subject to several methodological limitations. Owing to its focus on non-visual and multisensory hallucinations, established Parkinson's disease (PD) studies centered solely on visual hallucinations were excluded, though the number of existing studies likely necessitates a systematic review in its own right. Similarly, research examining hallucinations broadly, without specifying modality, was also omitted, including those utilizing the UPDRS as their primary hallucination assessment tool. Consequently, any findings relating solely to visual hallucinations were incomplete, and conclusions drawn from this review must consider this limitation.

Another significant limitation pertains to the lack of consideration of PD medications, especially in terms of their effects and associated timelines. This was a conscious decision, as the range of drugs and varying doses employed to treat myriad PD symptoms presents a complex and somewhat contentious topic. For instance, some PD drugs are known or believed to induce psychosis, whereas other neuropsychiatric medications are evidently prescribed to treat hallucinations. Until the clear effects of these substances on hallucinatory events are established, findings will need to be interpreted within this context.

Moreover, a lack of neuropathological confirmation of clinically suspected PD across the included studies has limited the generalizability of our conclusions, given that some cases may be re-classified as dementia with Lewy bodies or another Parkinsonism syndrome post-mortem.

### Are dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia the same disease [^113EAxKg]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), which share many clinical, neurochemical, and morphological features, have been incorporated into DSM-5 as two separate entities of major neurocognitive disorders with Lewy bodies. Despite clinical overlap, their diagnosis is based on an arbitrary distinction concerning the time of onset of motor and cognitive symptoms, namely as early cognitive impairment in DLB and later onset following that of motor symptoms in PDD. Their morphological hallmarks — cortical and subcortical α-synuclein/Lewy body plus β-amyloid and tau pathologies — are similar, but clinical differences at onset suggest some dissimilar profiles. Based on recent publications, including the fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium, a critical overview is provided herein.

- **Discussion**: The clinical constellations of DLB and PDD include cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. Intravitam PET and postmortem studies have revealed a more pronounced cortical atrophy, elevated cortical and limbic Lewy body pathologies, higher Aβ and tau loads in the cortex and striatum in DLB compared to PDD, and earlier cognitive defects in DLB. Conversely, multitracer PET studies have shown no differences in cortical and striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic deficits. Clinical management of both DLB and PDD includes cholinesterase inhibitors and other pharmacologic and non-drug strategies, yet with only mild symptomatic effects. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available.

### Psychosis in neurodegenerative dementias: A systematic comparative review [^113tvv4f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Psychosis, characterized by delusions and/or hallucinations, is frequently observed during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND) such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These symptoms pose diagnostic and management difficulties.

- **Objective**: This review aims to present a concise and up-to-date overview of psychotic symptoms in patients with ND using a comparative approach.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Ninety-eight original studies investigating psychosis phenotypes in neurodegenerative dementias were identified, consisting of 40 cohort studies and 57 case reports.

- **Results**: Psychosis is a frequently observed phenomenon during the course of ND, with reported prevalence ranging from 22.5% to 54.1% in AD, 55.9% to 73.9% in DLB, and 18% to 42% in FTD. Noticeable patterns emerge throughout all stages of these diseases, depending on their underlying causes. Misidentification delusions (16.6–78.3%) and visual hallucinations (50–69.6%) are frequently observed in DLB, while paranoid ideas and somatic preoccupations are particularly common in AD and FTD, respectively (9.1–60.3% and 3.10–41.5%). Limited data were found regarding psychosis in the early stages of these disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Literature data suggest that different ND are associated with noticeable variations in psychotic phenotypes, reflecting disease-specific tendencies. Further studies focusing on the early stages of these disorders are necessary to enhance our understanding of early psychosis.

### Retinal involvement in dementia with Lewy bodies: A clue to hallucinations [^113ipid4]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are a core feature of dementia with Lewy bodies, yet their pathophysiology is not well understood because neither clinical nor histological data have shown their basic mechanisms. Here, we report the presence of pale inclusions in the outer plexiform layer of the retina in a patient with dementia with Lewy bodies. These inclusions are related to cytoskeletal disorganization of the cones at the ultrastructural level and modifications of the immunohistochemical pattern of distribution of synucleins in the retina. These modifications may contribute to visual impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Barriers to treatment of hallucinations and delusions in people with dementia residing in long-term care [^113a5VTM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Most people with dementia will experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, including psychosis characterized by hallucinations and delusions. Across dementia subtypes, hallucinations and delusions are common, though their prevalence and presentation may vary. These symptoms have been associated with worse outcomes compared with dementia alone, including accelerated functional decline and mortality. Many people with dementia reside in long-term care facilities, and identification and management of hallucinations and delusions in this setting are critical.

For residents in long-term care facilities, the following factors can hinder management of hallucinations and delusions related to dementia:

1. Delayed recognition of symptoms
2. Reluctance of staff and family members to acknowledge psychiatric issues
3. Lack of approved pharmacotherapies to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis
4. Regulatory and institutional guidelines, including the long-term care regulatory guidelines established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the 5-star rating system

Barriers to the treatment of hallucinations and delusions in patients with dementia in the long-term care setting are myriad and complex. Early diagnosis of dementia-related psychosis and new treatment options for managing hallucinations and delusions are needed to improve care of this patient population.

### Visual text hallucinations of thoughts in an alexic woman [^112nFMnJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

In this report, we describe a patient with a clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, who had hallucinations of reading her thoughts in the air, although she was alexic and unable to read. She also had severe visuoperceptual deficits and the closing-in phenomenon. SPECT imaging demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left parieto-occipital cortices together with hyperperfusion of the left orbitofronto-temporal areas. Her visual text hallucinations may represent another type of textual hallucination related to syntacto-semantic network hyperactivation, which is implicated in auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.

### Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review [^112NcbJQ]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by prominent motor and non-motor symptoms. Classification as a movement disorder derives from its disabling motor symptoms, such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity, but non-motor symptoms also exert significant impact. Hallucinations are one such symptom, typically regarded as belonging to the psychiatric realm, but can be prevalent and distressing. Another non-motor symptom relates to cognitive decline; 31% of PD patients were diagnosed with dementia, with 83% eventually transitioning over 20 years. In fact, the presence of visual hallucinations has been identified as a significant risk factor for developing dementia. Yet beyond the visual mode, scant attention has been given to hallucinatory experiences in other sensory modalities in PD as well as their potential clinical and cognitive correlates.

- **Hallucinations in PD: prevalence, phenomenological characteristics, and correlates**: With the publication of a consensus definition of psychosis in PD, clinical and research attention to the role of hallucinations in the disorder has intensified. An early epidemiological review reported a point prevalence of up to 38% for visual hallucinations (lifetime 50%) and 22% for auditory hallucinations in PD, observing that olfactory and somatic-tactile hallucination rates were not systematically noted. A comparative review of visual hallucination incidence across Parkinsonism disorders instead cited rates up to 75%. A more recent meta-analysis calculated a pooled point prevalence of 28% and 9% for visual and auditory hallucinations, respectively.

### Hallucinations in older adults: A practical review [^1127BZkK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Low credibility.

Whilst our understanding, assessment, and treatment of hallucinations in older adults have improved in the last decade, greater priority needs to be given to communicating these advances to clinicians so that clinical care can be grounded in the best available evidence. The International Consortium of Hallucinations Research Working Group on Hallucinations in Older Adults was set up to respond to this challenge. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to highlight the key issues for the workforce caring for older adults with hallucinations; critically review assessment tools, management guidelines, and treatment approaches for this population; and offer recommendations and resources to support best practice.

### The natural history of psychosis and depression in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: Persistence and new cases over 1 year of follow-up [^117PM4Td]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Few data are available regarding the natural course of psychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease. Acquiring this information is essential to inform differential diagnosis and treatment decisions.

- **Method**: The study provides prospective data regarding a representative case-register cohort of patients with operationalized clinical diagnoses of dementia with Lewy bodies (N = 82) or Alzheimer's disease (N = 132). There was a verified accuracy of clinical diagnosis against postmortem examination. Psychosis was assessed using the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease, and depression was assessed with the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia at baseline and during annual follow-up.

- **Results**: Visual hallucinations were significantly more likely to be persistent in patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies (χ² = 19.1, df = 1, p < .0001). Although a number of other psychiatric symptoms were also more frequent at baseline in dementia with Lewy body patients, they were not significantly more likely to persist. Delusions and auditory hallucinations persisted in more than 40% of patients across both diagnostic groups. Patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies were significantly more likely to develop new auditory hallucinations over the year of follow-up (χ² = 14.4, df = 1, p < .0001).

- **Conclusion**: These results confirm that, although a number of psychiatric symptoms are common in dementia with Lewy bodies, it is only visual hallucinations that are significantly more persistent, which has important treatment implications.

### Molecular changes in the absence of severe pathology in the pulvinar in dementia with Lewy bodies [^1124Hojs]. Movement Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by transient clinical features, including fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, implicating dysfunction of cerebral hub regions, such as the pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. However, the pulvinar is typically only mildly affected by Lewy body pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting additional factors may account for its proposed dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of postmortem pulvinar tissue using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, protein expression analysis, and histological evaluation.

- **Results**: We identified 321 transcripts as significantly different between dementia with Lewy bodies cases and neurologically normal controls, with gene ontology pathway analysis suggesting the enrichment of transcripts related to synapses and positive regulation of immune functioning. At the protein level, proteins related to synaptic efficiency were decreased, and general synaptic markers remained intact. Analysis of glial subpopulations revealed astrogliosis without activated microglia, which was associated with synaptic changes but not neurodegenerative pathology.

- **Discussion**: These results indicate that the pulvinar, a region with relatively low Lewy body pathological burden, manifests changes at the molecular level that differ from previous reports in a more severely affected region. We speculate that these alterations result from neurodegenerative changes in regions connected to the pulvinar and likely contribute to a variety of cognitive changes resulting from decreased cortical connectivity.

### Pareidolias: Complex visual illusions in dementia with Lewy bodies [^112xkSnf]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Using a simple task, we successfully evoked pareidolias, which are complex visual illusions phenomenologically analogous to visual hallucinations, in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies experienced a much larger number of pareidolias. A sub-analysis of patients with or without donepezil suggested that cholinergic mechanisms are involved in visual hallucinations and in pareidolias. Our results suggest that tests that quantify pareidolias may be beneficial in the differential diagnosis of dementing disorders and may be a useful indicator of therapeutic response in dementia with Lewy bodies.

In addition, the pathomechanisms of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease have been considered similar to those observed in dementia with Lewy bodies. Visual illusions and minor hallucinations, such as presence and passage hallucinations, are reportedly common in Parkinson's disease without visual hallucinations. We suggest that pareidolias may be a phenomenon bridging visual illusions, minor hallucinations, and visual hallucinations. We are currently involved in a study on this topic.

### Progression to dementia in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer disease [^114YZ1De]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To determine whether mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or mild cognitive impairment with Alzheimer disease differ in their rates of clinical progression to dementia, we undertook longitudinal observation of mild cognitive impairment cases with detailed clinical assessment of Lewy body diagnostic characteristics.

- **Methods**: Two prospective longitudinal cohorts including 111 individuals aged 60 years and above with mild cognitive impairment were assessed annually to track cognitive and clinical progression, including the presence or absence of core clinical features and proposed biomarkers of dementia with Lewy bodies. Multistate modeling was used to assess the associations of diagnostic characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies with clinical progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, with death as a competing outcome.

- **Results**: After a mean follow-up of 2.2 years (range 1–6.7 years), 38 of the 111 (34%) participants progressed to dementia: 10 with Alzheimer's disease, 3 with possible dementia with Lewy bodies, and 25 with probable dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of any Lewy body disease characteristic was associated with an increased hazard of transition to dementia; this risk further increased as more diagnostic characteristics were observed (hazard ratio 1.33 per characteristic, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.60) and was especially high for those experiencing complex visual hallucinations (hazard ratio 1.98, 95% CI 0.92–4.29) or cognitive fluctuations (hazard ratio 3.99, 95% CI 2.03–7.84).

- **Conclusions**: Diagnostic characteristics of Lewy body disease were identified as significant indicators of progression to dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The study highlights the importance of recognizing these characteristics for early intervention and management strategies.

### Acute treatment of psychotic symptoms in a newly diagnosed Lewy body dementia patient with an accelerated titration schedule of rivastigmine and de-escalation of antipsychotics [^1159HUQz]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man presented with complaints of increased confusion, visual hallucinations, and a decline in memory. He was admitted to the hospital and started on quetiapine 50 mg daily for symptom management. Shortly after, he was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and started on rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), at 1.5 mg two times per day.

The patient's symptoms continued to worsen, leading to an increase in antipsychotics for aggressive behavior. Following his episode of physical aggression, an extensive medication management review was conducted, prompting an alternative treatment strategy. The quetiapine dose was reduced from 150 mg daily to 12.5 mg daily, his rivastigmine was increased to 3 mg two times per day, and all other antipsychotics were discontinued.

The up-titration of rivastigmine after 10 days of therapy was well tolerated with no adverse effects. He demonstrated a clear clinical response to optimized ChEI therapy and low-dose quetiapine, showing improvements in alertness and functioning.

### Pareidolias: complex visual illusions in dementia with Lewy bodies [^114MbUpF]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

- **Contents of illusory responses**: On the Pareidolia test, numbers denote a percentage of the total illusory responses in each patient group.

- **Examples of illusory responses**: Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies often misidentified objects or patterns in the picture as real faces (yellow triangle) or as figures of people and animals (white triangle).

We determined the contents of visual hallucinations in each of 25 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies using medical records. Visual hallucinations of people, animals, plants, and man-made objects were found in 21 (84%), 12 (48%), 2 (8%), and 2 patients (8%), respectively. Overall, the dominant contents of illusory responses in the Pareidolia test were consistent with those of visual hallucinations, with people and animals accounting for more than 80% of contents. When comparing the contents of visual hallucinations and those of illusory responses on a patient-by-patient basis, they did not always agree. The contents of illusory responses depended on the contents of the pictorial stimuli; for instance, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies frequently saw human faces but rarely found animals in the petals of flowers. They tended to find animals but hardly saw people around the feet of a leopard (Fig. 3B).

### Auditory and visual hallucination prevalence in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bvzEr]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) in Lewy body dementia (LBD) are complex, typically polymodal, and varied in their presentation, although there is a paucity of high-quality, qualitative descriptions. Most common were verbal AH, perceived as originating outside the head, which differentiates verbal AH in Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from those found in schizophrenia. Interestingly, of the three studies to report relative rates of different types of AH, two found that verbal hallucinations formed the majority in PD [Fénelon et al; Amar et al.], while Suárez-González et al. reported that these were a minority in DLB. This may suggest a difference in AH presentation between the two conditions.

Non-verbal AH (acouasms) were also common and complex, whether animate or inanimate. These findings suggest auditory cortex and wider temporal and frontal lobe involvement in AH in PD and DLB, a speculation that is supported by neuroimaging data [Matsui et al.]. Some reports of simpler acouasms were also noted. The potential overlap between acouasms and tinnitus suggests that our estimated pooled prevalence of AH may be lower than the true prevalence in the population. Indeed, a recent cross-sectional study found that in a sample of 1000 patients in a cognitive neurology clinic, verbal and musical hallucinations had a prevalence of 0.9%, while tinnitus was present in 6.9% [Bayón et al.].

AH were described as providing a soundtrack to visual hallucinations (VH) [Fénelon et al.], such as when a patient hears conversations of visually hallucinated people talking. This presentation is noteworthy, as numerous authors described VH as preceding AH.

### Pareidolias: Complex visual illusions in dementia with Lewy bodies [^111HpzNY]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Patients rarely experience visual hallucinations while being observed by clinicians, underscoring the need for instruments that can directly detect these hallucinations from patients. Pareidolias, which are complex visual illusions involving ambiguous forms perceived as meaningful objects, are analogous to visual hallucinations and have the potential to serve as surrogate indicators of these phenomena. In this study, we explored the clinical utility of a newly developed instrument, the Pareidolia test, designed to evoke pareidolic illusions in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a common cause of visual hallucinations in the elderly.

Thirty-four patients with DLB, 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 26 healthy controls were administered the Pareidolia test. Results showed that patients with DLB produced a significantly greater number of pareidolic illusions compared to those with Alzheimer's disease or the controls. A receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that the number of pareidolias could differentiate DLB from Alzheimer's disease with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%.

- **Result details**: Full-length figures and faces of people and animals accounted for over 80% of the contents of pareidolias. Notably, pareidolias were observed in patients with DLB regardless of whether they experienced visual hallucinations, suggesting that while pareidolias may not directly reflect hallucinations, they may indicate a susceptibility to them.

### Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management [^112tfnhk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations (VH) are a significant aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD) and fall within a progressive spectrum of symptoms known as PD psychosis. This begins with illusions, presence hallucinations, and passage hallucinations, eventually advancing to well-formed hallucinations, typically involving people and animals. VH poses a unique challenge in PD, as treatments for motor symptoms can induce or worsen these hallucinations. They are linked to higher mortality rates, potentially due to antipsychotic use, and predict nursing home placement more strongly than cognitive or motor symptoms. The stigma associated with mental illness may result in under-reporting. VH significantly affects caregivers, causing increased distress as the patient's insight into their hallucinations deteriorates. Compared to PD patients without VH, those with VH experience a reduced quality of life.

The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) 2017 guidelines for PD recommend a staged treatment approach, typically managed within a PD service. Initially, this involves reviewing medical or pharmacological triggers and conducting a delirium screen, along with advice on general coping strategies. A reduction in PD medication may be necessary, with careful monitoring for worsening motor symptoms, dopamine withdrawal syndrome, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Medications should be withdrawn systematically, starting with those most likely to provoke VH, including anticholinergics, amantadine, and MAO-B inhibitors, followed by dopamine agonists and COMT inhibitors. If VH persists, a cautious withdrawal of levodopa may be beneficial. If these strategies do not succeed, the consideration of antipsychotic medications may be necessary.

### Visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism [^114gfYrF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

What is the role of visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism?

Given the high prevalence of visual hallucinations (VH) in patients with Lewy body pathologies, it is tempting to consider that their emergence and development might, in some way, be due to neuronal dysfunction that is specific to α-synuclein protein accumulation. VH are established as a diagnostic feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The prevalence of VH in Parkinson's disease (PD), compared with other forms of parkinsonism, argues they should form part of the diagnostic criteria for PD also.

Although both DLB and PD are characterized by Lewy body pathology, VH are significantly more common and tend to present earlier in DLB. The major difference between these conditions under the microscope is the distribution of the Lewy body pathology. In both, Lewy body neurodegeneration occurs in the brainstem and limbic structures, but clinical dementia correlates with neocortical Lewy body density regardless of other clinical features. It is in these patients that VH are more likely to occur.

Therefore, as a clinical marker, VH are much more likely to reflect the topographic distribution of pathology than characteristics inherent to specific insoluble protein accumulations, such as α-synuclein, or even β-amyloid or tau. In this light, VH as a diagnostic feature of Lewy body pathology is limited by the extent to which other pathologies affect the brain regions important in the genesis of VH. Fortunately, most clinical and pathological studies report a low frequency of VH in non-Lewy body forms of parkinsonism, which we would interpret as a sign of their specificity to Lewy body pathology.

### Functional and structural brain network correlates of visual hallucinations in Lewy body dementia [^114yvqFL]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are a common feature of Lewy body dementia. Previous studies have shown that visual hallucinations are highly specific in differentiating Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer's disease dementia and Alzheimer-Lewy body mixed pathology cases. Computational models propose that impairment of visual and attentional networks is key to the manifestation of visual hallucination symptomatology. However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence on functional and structural brain network abnormalities associated with visual hallucinations in Lewy body dementia.

We used EEG source localization and network-based statistics to assess differential topographical patterns in Lewy body dementia between 25 participants with visual hallucinations and 17 participants without hallucinations. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess structural connectivity between the thalamus, basal forebrain, and cortical regions belonging to the functionally affected network component in the hallucinating group, as assessed with network-based statistics. The number of white matter streamlines within the cortex and between subcortical and cortical regions was compared between hallucinating and non-hallucinating groups and correlated with average EEG source connectivity of the affected subnetwork.

Moreover, the modular organization of the EEG source network was obtained, compared between groups, and tested for correlation with structural connectivity. Network analysis showed that compared to non-hallucinating patients, those with hallucinations feature consistent weakened connectivity.

### On visual hallucinations and cortical networks: a trans-diagnostic review [^115iaBoW]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease patients with dementia and visual hallucinations (N = 7) were compared to those without hallucinations (N = 8). This study found reduced grey matter in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex.

Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations (N = 11) were compared to those without hallucinations (N = 13). Although there were grey matter reductions bilaterally in the prefrontal and parietal cortices in both groups compared to healthy controls (N = 14), there were no significant differences in grey matter between patients with and without visual hallucinations.

In Parkinson's disease patients without dementia, with (N = 13) and without visual hallucinations (N = 13), visual hallucinations were associated with reduced volume in bilateral occipital regions, right supramarginal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, and the middle portion of the left cingulate gyrus.

For Parkinson's disease with visual hallucinations (N = 25, 6 of whom also had auditory hallucinations) compared to Parkinson's disease without visual hallucinations (N = 25), visual hallucinations were linked to reduced grey matter volume bilaterally in the cuneus, fusiform gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, inferior parietal lobule, cingulate, and precentral gyrus, as well as regions in the right lingual gyrus and left paracentral gyrus.

Overall, the studies highlight the association between visual hallucinations and reductions in grey matter volume in specific regions of the brain in Parkinson's disease patients.

### Dementia with Lewy bodies: An emerging disease [^1156uoCt]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies appears to be the second most common form of dementia, accounting for about one in five cases. The condition is characterized by dementia accompanied by delirium, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Other common symptoms include syncope, falls, sleep disorders, and depression. The presence of both Lewy bodies and amyloid plaques with deficiencies in both acetylcholine and dopamine neurotransmitters suggests that dementia with Lewy bodies represents the middle of a disease spectrum ranging from Alzheimer's disease to Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is based on clinical features and exclusion of other diagnoses. Individualized behavioral, environmental, and pharmacologic therapies are used to alleviate symptoms and support patients and their families. Cholinesterase inhibitors are more effective in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies than in those with Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies do not respond as well to antiparkinsonian medications. Anticholinergic medications should be avoided because they exacerbate the symptoms of dementia. Traditional antipsychotic medications can precipitate severe reactions and may double or triple the rate of mortality in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism [^114vUwmF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations (VH) occur commonly in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but are reported much less frequently in other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration syndrome. This clinical sign may be helpful when considering the differential diagnosis of patients with parkinsonism. The observation that VH may be specific to Lewy body pathology probably reflects a greater vulnerability of the visual systems to PD and DLB neurodegeneration compared with other diseases.

Topographic differences in pathology are probably the major factor producing VH in Lewy body diseases, rather than neurophysiological changes that are specific to α-synuclein protein accumulation. VH correlate with pathology in the limbic system and more specifically the amygdala, which is frequently affected in PD and DLB but relatively preserved in other forms of parkinsonism often misdiagnosed as PD.

In this review, the published frequencies of VH in these different conditions are compared to put into context the notion of VH as a clinical clue to underlying Lewy body pathology.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^111Kz6y6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

In LBD, including both Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), VH have a high prevalence and heterogeneous phenomenology. Visual experiences in LBD can be grouped into minor hallucinations, illusions, passage and presence hallucinations, and complex hallucinations.

Illusions are perceptions of something objectively existing in such a way as to cause misinterpretation of its actual nature. One type of illusion, pareidolia, is defined as the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a random or ambiguous visual pattern, like seeing faces in clouds. Passage hallucinations are referred to as unformed shadows of something or someone passing fast in the periphery of the eye field. Presence hallucinations consist of the sensation or vision that someone is behind oneself.

Minor hallucinations may also arise as precursors of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may appear even in the absence of dopaminergic treatment. Complex VH in LBD consist of well-formed and stereotyped visions of insects, people (familiar or unfamiliar, alive or dead), animals, or animated figures (often children). They can move but rarely talk, are mostly annoying or amusing before becoming threatening, and predominantly appear in low stimuli environments, usually crepuscular or at night.

The phenomenology of these visual experiences may be linked with LBD disease progression according to Braak stages. Indeed, minor hallucinations occur when alterations mainly involve the brainstem and can be due to an alteration in the interaction.

### Hallucinations in older adults: A practical review [^111BUjLk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Low credibility.

Management and Treatment Approaches:

Guidelines and treatment recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. The focus is typically on the overall management of a specific clinical condition, with hallucinations being one of the symptoms covered, as seen in the NICE Guidelines for Parkinson's disease. At the time of writing, few guidelines have focused specifically on hallucinations, with the forthcoming SHAPED (Study of Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, Eye disease, and Dementia) consensus guidelines being the first to concentrate on visual hallucinations in older adults.

All guidelines for hallucinations adopt the view that different treatments are required at different disease or hallucination stages, and that experiencing hallucinations may not, in itself, necessitate a specific treatment beyond general measures such as education, reassurance, physical, and medication reviews. For example, the SHAPED guidelines suggest including a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health, given that these may be masked by other conditions; for instance, cognitive impairment may be overlooked in a patient with eye disease, with their decline in functional ability attributed to visual loss.

Early provision of information about the risk of hallucinations is emphasized as a means of reducing stigma, encouraging healthcare professionals to routinely ask about hallucinations, thereby shifting the onus of reporting away from the patient. The point at which specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for hallucinations are required is not clearly defined in guidelines but is based on clinical judgment.

### Functional connectivity in Lewy body disease with visual hallucinations [^1127WE1H]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Twenty-six participants (11 control, 3 with DLB, 4 with PD dementia, 2 with PD with mild cognitive impairment, and 7 with MCI-LB) were excluded due to excessive movement on the scan, leaving 41 with LB_VH, 48 with LB_noVH, and 60 controls. Figure S1 shows the image quality control graphs. There were no group differences in maximum framewise motion (F 2,146 = 1.2; p = 0.3) and mean motion (F 2,146 = 0.35; p = 0.7). However, the number of excluded volumes was significantly different between groups (F 2,146 = 4.1, p = 0.018), with the LB_VH group having slightly higher excluded volumes (mean 9.4) compared to control and LB_noVH (4.5).

Table 2 shows the demographics and cognitive scores for the participants included in the analysis. Compared to LB_noVH participants, LB_VH participants had significantly worse cognition and higher UPDRS motor scores. As expected, LB_VH participants scored higher on the NPI hallucination scale, worse on ACE-R visuospatial scores, and on the pareidolia task, they missed a higher proportion of present faces while tending to see non-existent faces. Table S1 includes a breakdown of participants according to diagnosis (DLB, PD with mild cognitive impairment, PD dementia, MCI-LB), as well as details of cholinesterase inhibitor, antipsychotic, and parkinsonian medication. There were no significant differences in medication between those with and without visual hallucinations in participants with either dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Of those with visual hallucinations who completed the NEVHI, 18 out of 22 had experienced visual hallucinations.

### Visual hallucinations in the psychosis spectrum and comparative information from neurodegenerative disorders and eye disease [^112Xu4iQ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

- **Association with other symptoms**: In schizophrenia, visual hallucinations (VHs) typically co-occur with hallucinations in other sensory modalities. For example, co-occurring visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported in up to 84% of individuals with schizophrenia. Early evidence suggested VHs never occurred in psychosis without the presence of auditory hallucinations, either at the same time (multimodality hallucinations) or on different occasions. In Oorschot et al.'s sample of individuals with mixed psychosis, VHs occurring alone were rarer than auditory hallucinations occurring alone. As shown in Table 1, auditory hallucinations predominate over VHs in terms of their relative prevalence.

Hallucinations in multiple modalities have also been noted in individuals with severe depression and mixed psychiatric diagnoses, as well as in nonclinical adults and adolescents (n = 355, ages 11–13 years). Such co-occurrences of auditory and visual hallucinations suggest a common hallucinatory mechanism, which, combined with specific sensory dysfunctions, determines the modality of hallucinations.

It is important to note, however, that "simultaneous" (or "fused") auditory and visual hallucinations are not frequently occurring. In most cases, they are experienced at different times (e.g. an auditory hallucination one day and a VH the next). Furthermore, when simultaneous auditory and visual hallucinations do occur, they are typically unrelated (e.g. seeing the devil while hearing the voice of a relative inside one's head), suggesting that the mechanisms for auditory and visual hallucinations in these disorders must be partly independent.

### How to diagnose dementia with Lewy bodies: State of the art [^116DjXGg]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in older people. It has only been recognized in the past decade and remains widely underdiagnosed. At postmortem examination, affected patients show numerous alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (LB) in many parts of the cerebral cortex, particularly the neocortical and limbic areas, in addition to the nigral LB degeneration characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Unlike PD, clinical presentation involves progressive cognitive decline, with particular deficits in visuospatial ability and frontal executive function. This is accompanied by usually only mildly to moderately severe parkinsonism, which is often akinetic-rigid without the classical parkinsonian rest-tremor. Further accompanying features include spontaneous visual hallucinations and conspicuous fluctuations in alertness and cognitive performance.

The two main differential diagnoses are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To improve the differential diagnosis of DLB, consensus criteria have been developed that establish possible and probable levels of clinical diagnostic accuracy. Generally, their sensitivity is variable and low, but their specificity is high. The consensus is to restrict a diagnosis of DLB to patients with parkinsonism who develop dementia within 12 months of the onset of motor symptoms. Using operationalized criteria, DLB can be diagnosed clinically with accuracy similar to that achieved for AD or PD. Ancillary investigations, particularly neuroimaging, support this process.

### Functional and structural brain network correlates of visual hallucinations in Lewy body dementia [^111BGySo]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are a common feature of Lewy body dementia. Previous studies have shown that visual hallucinations are highly specific in differentiating Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer's disease dementia and Alzheimer–Lewy body mixed pathology cases. Computational models propose that impairment of visual and attentional networks is etiologically key to the manifestation of visual hallucination symptomatology; however, there is still a lack of experimental evidence on functional and structural brain network abnormalities associated with visual hallucinations in Lewy body dementia.

We used EEG source localization and network-based statistics to assess differential topographical patterns in Lewy body dementia between 25 participants with visual hallucinations and 17 participants without hallucinations. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess structural connectivity between the thalamus, basal forebrain, and cortical regions belonging to the functionally affected network component in the hallucinating group, as assessed with network-based statistics. The number of white matter streamlines within the cortex and between subcortical and cortical regions was compared between hallucinating and non-hallucinating groups and correlated with average EEG source connectivity of the affected subnetwork. Moreover, the modular organization of the EEG source network was obtained, compared between groups, and tested for correlation with structural connectivity.

Network analysis showed that compared to non-hallucinating patients, those with hallucinations feature consistent weakening in specific network connectivity.

### Auditory and visual hallucination prevalence in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115BouoE]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The initial focus was to estimate auditory hallucination (AH) prevalence in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As all studies included in this analysis also reported the number of participants who had visual hallucinations (VH), these data were also extracted and analyzed. Numerous papers in the literature report VH but do not report other forms of hallucinations. Consequently, the estimates of VH do not contain all available evidence, but provide comparison data that allow confidence that VH are more common than AH.

Across the timespan of included studies, diagnostic criteria for PD have largely remained unchanged. However, there have been multiple iterations of the consensus criteria for DLB diagnosis, each of which has modified the specificity and sensitivity of this diagnosis (Rizzo et al.). This may be another source of between-studies heterogeneity; however, the low number of DLB studies included in the analyses did not allow meta-regression models to be constructed for these data. The lowest I² values observed in the meta-analyses were found for DLB studies (Figs 3a and 5a), which argues against the possible contribution of diagnostic criteria to the observed heterogeneity.

Two potentially confounding covariates were later age of diagnosis of DLB than PD and the inclusion of lower quality studies (online Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, neither of these was found to account for a significant proportion of the variance in the meta-regression models (online Supplementary Table S3). This does not exclude the possibility that age of diagnosis or age per se contributes to hallucinosis. Indeed, the presentation of VH in a…

### Visual symptoms in Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia [^117JAJKx]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Visual symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD dementia and include difficulty reading, double vision, illusions, feelings of presence and passage, and complex visual hallucinations. Despite the established prognostic implications of complex visual hallucinations, the interaction between cognitive decline, visual impairment, and other visual symptoms remains poorly understood. Our aim was to characterize the spectrum of visual symptomatology in PD and examine clinical predictors for their occurrence.

Sixty-four subjects with PD, 26 with PD dementia, and 32 age-matched controls were assessed for visual symptoms, cognitive impairment, and ocular pathology. Complex visual hallucinations were common in PD (17%) and PD dementia (89%). Dementia subjects reported illusions (65%) and presence (62%) more frequently than PD or control subjects, but the frequency of passage hallucinations in PD and PD dementia groups was equivalent (48% versus 69%, respectively; P = 0.102). Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were impaired in parkinsonian subjects, with disease severity and age emerging as key predictors.

Regression analysis identified a variety of factors independently predictive of complex visual hallucinations (e.g. dementia, visual acuity, and depression), illusions (e.g. excessive daytime somnolence and disease severity), and presence (e.g. rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime somnolence). Our results demonstrate that different "hallucinatory" experiences in PD do not necessarily share common disease predictors and may, therefore, be driven by different factors.

### Visual hallucinations in the psychosis spectrum and comparative information from neurodegenerative disorders and eye disease [^1174gwBy]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are a common feature in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including the psychosis spectrum disorders. This paper explores the comparative information on visual hallucinations arising from these disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and eye disease.

- **Clinical implications**: Understanding the similarities and differences in visual hallucinations across these conditions can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies.

- **Research findings**: The occurrence of visual hallucinations is not exclusive to psychiatric conditions; they are also prevalent in neurodegenerative disorders and eye diseases, which suggests shared underlying mechanisms.

- **Future directions**: Further research into these shared mechanisms may provide new insights into treatment approaches for visual hallucinations across different disorders.

### Visual hallucinations in the psychosis spectrum and comparative information from neurodegenerative disorders and eye disease [^113BCJJt]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Much of the research on visual hallucinations (VHs) has been conducted in the context of eye disease and neurodegenerative conditions, but little is known about these phenomena in psychiatric and nonclinical populations. The purpose of this article is to bring together knowledge regarding VHs in the psychosis phenotype and contrast this data with the literature drawn from neurodegenerative disorders and eye disease. The evidence challenges the traditional views that VHs are atypical or uncommon in psychosis. The weighted mean for VHs is 27% in schizophrenia, 15% in affective psychosis, and 7.3% in the general community.

VHs are linked to a more severe psychopathological profile and less favorable outcome in psychosis and neurodegenerative conditions. VHs typically co-occur with auditory hallucinations, suggesting a common etiological cause. VHs in psychosis are also remarkably complex, negative in content, and are interpreted to have personal relevance. The cognitive mechanisms of VHs in psychosis have rarely been investigated, but existing studies point to source-monitoring deficits and distortions in top-down mechanisms, although evidence for visual processing deficits, which feature strongly in the organic literature, is lacking.

Brain imaging studies point to the activation of visual cortex during hallucinations on a background of structural and connectivity changes within wider brain networks. The relationship between VHs in psychosis, eye disease, and neurodegeneration remains unclear, although the pattern of similarities and differences described in this review suggests further exploration is necessary.

### The clinical phenotype of psychiatric-onset prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies: A scoping review [^111ZyfMV]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

When compared to Alzheimer's dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with poorer outcomes, including increased mortality, caregiver burden, and the need for earlier residential care. These observations likely reflect the comorbid parkinsonian and neuropsychiatric features typical of DLB. The recently revised diagnostic criteria for DLB highlight aggressive cognitive decline in combination with four core clinical features: parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). The presence of at least two of these core features, or one core feature and an indicative biomarker (such as polysomnographic confirmation of REM sleep without atonia, abnormal iodine MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, or reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the basal ganglia), allows for a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria recognize a range of supportive clinical features, such as constipation, hyposmia, and daytime somnolence, which can assist in making the diagnosis.

Given its mixed clinical phenotype, the accurate diagnosis of DLB can be delayed by several years. This delay is likely to impact the success of disease-modifying strategies that rely on diagnosis at the earliest point in time. Therefore, as seen with other neurodegenerative conditions, there has been an increasing emphasis on the identification of prodromal DLB. DLB is a synucleinopathy with differential cell loss occurring across multiple neurotransmitters and neural pathways.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for Lewy body dementia: A systematic review [^113nn619]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Lewy body dementia poses a number of challenges for clinical management that differ from those of other dementias. People with Lewy body dementia typically experience visual hallucinations and may be more likely to have delusions than people with other types of dementia. These symptoms can be very distressing to both patients and their carers and are a risk factor for early institutionalization. Pharmacological management is limited because of the condition's adverse sensitivity to neuroleptics (antipsychotic drugs). Antidepressants also appear to be poorly tolerated, with no clear evidence that they are effective for treating mood disturbances in this population, though further research is needed. At the same time, patients typically have parkinsonian motor disturbances, and treatment responses are limited by the fact that some antiparkinson medications can exacerbate psychotic symptoms. People with Lewy body dementia are also prone to falls, which further increases the risks of using medications that exacerbate orthostatic hypotension, impair cognition, or otherwise predispose to falls. Finally, people with Lewy body dementia may undergo faster cognitive decline, require higher costs of care, result in greater caregiver burden, and progress more quickly to death.
