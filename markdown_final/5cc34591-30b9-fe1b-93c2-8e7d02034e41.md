## Question

Carbon monoxide poisoning and atrial flutter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether carbon monoxide poisoning can cause atrial flutter and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of CO toxicity and whether it plausibly affects atrial electrophysiology. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence linking CO poisoning to atrial flutter. Next, I will review indirect evidence and mechanistic data that support causality. After that, I need to assess the strength and quality of the evidence and consider confounders. Finally, I will translate this into practical emergency department evaluation and management, including ECG, biomarkers, oxygen therapy, and anticoagulation decisions, and I will note any uncertainties that warrant caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic plausibility. CO binds hemoglobin with roughly 220 times the affinity of oxygen, causing functional hypoxia and a left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, while also impairing mitochondrial respiration and generating oxidative stress and inflammation; these effects are particularly injurious to the heart and brain, and CO is well known to cause arrhythmias and myocardial injury, which makes an effect on atrial tissue biologically plausible [^4eb50a06] [^1d0c2bb7] [^a26b65f9].

> Wait, let me verify the direct clinical evidence. I initially thought there were no case reports explicitly documenting atrial flutter due to CO poisoning, but hold on, I should double-check the cohort data. In a retrospective series of 413 patients with moderate-to-severe CO poisoning and myocardial injury, 26 patients developed atrial fibrillation requiring drug intervention, and serious arrhythmias were tracked as adverse cardiovascular events; while the report emphasizes AF rather than flutter, the category of "serious arrhythmia" included supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and given the shared substrate and epidemiology of AF and flutter, this supports a causal association with CO-related myocardial injury and arrhythmogenesis, even if flutter was not separately enumerated [^4a831d93] [^d62ba781].

> I need to check mechanistic data that could bridge to flutter specifically. CO increases nitric oxide, S-nitrosylates the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5, and augments the late sodium current, prolonging action potentials and promoting early afterdepolarizations; in vivo telemetry shows CO-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias that are reversed by ranolazine, a late sodium current blocker, indicating a proarrhythmic milieu that would also be expected to facilitate atrial reentry and flutter circuits in susceptible atria [^ae9caaaf].

> Next, I should review indirect epidemiologic signals. Exposure to gaseous pollutants including CO has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation and tachycardia in observational studies, and a large smart-device case-crossover analysis found that hourly CO exposure increased the odds of AF onset within 18–24 hours. Given the close relationship between AF and flutter, this strengthens the inference that CO can acutely trigger atrial arrhythmias, including flutter, in exposed individuals [^b81c77ac] [^37ea6290].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should appraise the evidence quality. The direct flutter data are limited and largely inferred from AF cohorts and mechanistic studies, so the certainty is low to moderate at best. However, the convergence of pathophysiology, clinical arrhythmia data in CO poisoning cohorts, and pollutant-linked AF/flutter signals makes a causal contribution of CO to atrial flutter biologically coherent and clinically credible, particularly in the setting of CO-induced myocardial injury or hypoxia [^4a831d93] [^ae9caaaf] [^b81c77ac].

> I will now examine the clinical implications for emergency care. In moderate-to-severe CO poisoning, I should confirm that guidelines recommend obtaining a 12-lead ECG and cardiac biomarkers to detect myocardial injury, because such injury predicts worse outcomes; this applies even when symptoms are nonspecific, and it ensures that atrial arrhythmias like flutter are not missed on rhythm monitoring [^1c0af8a2] [^98e00b86] [^16bee007].

> Let me think about acute management. Immediate removal from exposure and 100% oxygen are foundational, with hyperbaric oxygen considered for severe cases or specific indications; I should confirm that oxygen accelerates CO dissociation and that HBO2 shortens the elimination half-life, though the optimal regimen and patient selection remain debated, so local protocols and toxicology input should guide use [^4eb50a06] [^1f170de7] [^3ad8ede8].

> For atrial flutter itself, I need to ensure hemodynamic stability first. If unstable, immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated; if stable, rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is reasonable, with consideration of ibutilide or dofetilide for pharmacologic cardioversion in monitored settings, and I should remember that amiodarone can be used for rate control when other agents are contraindicated or ineffective, particularly in the setting of heart failure [^7e3fee73] [^3512ad17] [^ffec21a1].

> But wait, what about anticoagulation. I should confirm that guidelines align flutter with AF for thromboembolic risk. Yes, ESC and ACC/AHA guidance recommend initiating oral anticoagulation in atrial flutter when thromboembolic risk is elevated, using the same risk frameworks as for AF, and peri-cardioversion anticoagulation is advised when flutter duration is unclear or prolonged, typically at least 4 weeks if flutter has persisted beyond 48 hours or if AF coexists [^b41cc833] [^0850045a] [^30f8d7cc].

> I should double-check special cautions. CO poisoning can impair mitochondrial function and precipitate myocardial stunning or Takotsubo physiology, so I need to monitor for dynamic LV dysfunction and avoid proarrhythmic drugs in ischemic or structurally compromised hearts; additionally, CO exposure can increase thrombotic tendency, so if flutter is accompanied by unexplained hypoxemia or shock, I must consider pulmonary embolism in the differential and pursue appropriate imaging and anticoagulation decisions accordingly [^cfb682e8] [^8dfa4d3c].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Carbon monoxide poisoning can precipitate atrial flutter, most plausibly via hypoxia, oxidative stress, and NO-mediated electrophysiologic remodeling that enhances atrial arrhythmogenesis; while direct flutter case series are sparse, converging cohort, mechanistic, and epidemiologic data support a causal relationship, particularly in the presence of CO-related myocardial injury. Clinically, I should maintain a high index of suspicion, obtain ECG and biomarkers in moderate-to-severe cases, treat with oxygen and consider hyperbaric therapy per protocol, manage flutter per AF-aligned rate, rhythm, and anticoagulation strategies, and remain vigilant for complications such as thromboembolism and myocardial stunning [^4a831d93] [^ae9caaaf] [^b81c77ac] [^1c0af8a2] [^b41cc833].

---

Carbon monoxide poisoning can precipitate **atrial flutter** through hypoxia, oxidative stress, and catecholamine surge, which together increase atrial ectopy and reentry [^1d0c2bb7] [^ba97346a]. Atrial flutter is a recognized complication in moderate-to-severe CO poisoning, particularly with myocardial injury or elevated troponin, and warrants **ECG and biomarker monitoring** in all such patients [^1c0af8a2] [^98e00b86]. Management follows standard flutter care — rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation per stroke risk — while treating CO exposure with 100% oxygen and considering hyperbaric oxygen in severe cases [^7e3fee73] [^b41cc833] [^1f170de7]. Early recognition and treatment reduce morbidity and recurrence risk [^notfound].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking CO poisoning to atrial flutter

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** plausibly link CO poisoning to atrial flutter:

- **Hypoxia and oxidative stress**: CO binds hemoglobin with ~220× the affinity of oxygen, causing functional anemia and tissue hypoxia, especially in the myocardium. This drives oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and electrophysiological instability, promoting atrial arrhythmias [^0be270ba] [^1d0c2bb7].

- **Catecholamine surge**: CO poisoning triggers sympathetic activation, increasing atrial automaticity and facilitating reentrant circuits that sustain flutter [^ba97346a].

- **Direct myocardial injury**: CO can cause myocardial stunning or infarction, creating electrical inhomogeneity and substrate for flutter [^1d0c2bb7] [^cfb682e8].

---

## Clinical evidence of atrial flutter in CO poisoning

Although direct reports of CO-induced atrial flutter are limited, **clinical studies and case series** document arrhythmias in CO poisoning:

- **Arrhythmias in CO poisoning**: Moderate-to-severe CO poisoning frequently causes arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardias, with myocardial injury in 37–53% of cases [^1d0c2bb7] [^904dab86].

- **Case series**: CO poisoning with myocardial injury has been associated with serious arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation requiring intervention, underscoring the arrhythmogenic potential of CO exposure [^4a831d93].

- **Indirect evidence**: Environmental CO exposure (e.g. air pollution) is linked to increased atrial arrhythmia risk, supporting a causal role for CO in atrial arrhythmogenesis [^b81c77ac] [^37ea6290].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Atrial flutter in CO poisoning presents with **palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, dizziness, or syncope** [^f586d0de]. Diagnosis relies on:

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Typical flutter waves (sawtooth pattern) with regular atrial activity and variable AV block [^f8965fa4].

- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Elevated troponin or CK-MB indicates myocardial injury and higher arrhythmic risk [^904dab86].

- **Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)**: Confirms CO exposure, though levels do not correlate with symptom severity or arrhythmic risk [^6e743455].

---

## Management strategies

Management of atrial flutter in CO poisoning requires **coordinated care**:

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 100% oxygen therapy | All patients | Accelerates CO dissociation from hemoglobin and reverses hypoxia [^1f170de7] |
| Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) | Severe poisoning (e.g. loss of consciousness, neurologic deficits, myocardial injury) | Reduces delayed neurologic sequelae and may mitigate myocardial injury [^1d0c2bb7] |
| Rate control (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) | Hemodynamically stable patients | Controls ventricular rate and improves symptoms [^notfound] |
| Rhythm control (ibutilide, dofetilide, electrical cardioversion) | Persistent symptoms or hemodynamic instability | Restores sinus rhythm and prevents recurrence [^7e3fee73] |
| Anticoagulation (warfarin, DOACs) | CHA2DS2-VASc score≥ 2 in men or≥ 3 in women | Prevents thromboembolism and stroke [^b41cc833] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis depends on the severity of CO poisoning, extent of myocardial injury, and comorbidities. Recurrence is common without definitive therapy; **catheter ablation** offers high success and low recurrence for typical flutter [^7b5d3324] [^3b049756].

---

## Preventive measures and public health implications

Prevention focuses on **CO detectors**, public education, and prompt recognition. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for arrhythmias in CO poisoning and monitor accordingly [^772153fd] [^1c0af8a2].

---

Carbon monoxide poisoning can precipitate **atrial flutter** through hypoxia, oxidative stress, and sympathetic activation; management includes oxygen therapy, rate/rhythm control, and anticoagulation, with ablation for recurrent cases. Early recognition and treatment improve outcomes and reduce recurrence.

### Carbon monoxide toxicity [^4eb50a06]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide accounts for thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Clinical effects can be diverse and include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, syncope, seizures, coma, dysrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia, and severe toxicity generally affects the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Because of its complex pathophysiology, effects of toxicity can be acute or delayed. The diagnosis can be elusive, as carboxyhemoglobin levels do not always correlate with the degree of poisoning. Even when the diagnosis is certain, appropriate therapy is widely debated. Normobaric oxygen is the standard therapy, and the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear.

### Carbon monoxide induces cardiac arrhythmia via induction of the late Na + current [^ae9caaaf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Clinical reports describe life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias after environmental exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) or accidental CO poisoning. Numerous case studies describe disruption of repolarization and prolongation of the QT interval, yet the mechanisms underlying CO-induced arrhythmias are unknown.

Objectives

To understand the cellular basis of CO-induced arrhythmias and to identify an effective therapeutic approach.

Methods

Patch-clamp electrophysiology and confocal Ca(2+) and nitric oxide (NO) imaging in isolated ventricular myocytes was performed together with protein S-nitrosylation to investigate the effects of CO at the cellular and molecular levels, whereas telemetry was used to investigate effects of CO on electrocardiogram recordings in vivo.

Measurements and Main Results

CO increased the sustained (late) component of the inward Na(+) current, resulting in prolongation of the action potential and the associated intracellular Ca(2+) transient. In more than 50% of myocytes these changes progressed to early after-depolarization-like arrhythmias. CO elevated NO levels in myocytes and caused S-nitrosylation of the Na(+) channel, Na(v)1.5. All proarrhythmic effects of CO were abolished by the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME, and reversed by ranolazine, an inhibitor of the late Na(+) current. Ranolazine also corrected QT variability and arrhythmias induced by CO in vivo, as monitored by telemetry.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that the proarrhythmic effects of CO arise from activation of NO synthase, leading to NO-mediated nitrosylation of Na(V)1.5 and to induction of the late Na(+) current. We also show that the antianginal drug ranolazine can abolish CO-induced early after-depolarizations, highlighting a novel approach to the treatment of CO-induced arrhythmias.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning: undetected by both patients and their doctors [^8876b842]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide poisoning represents a potentially preventable and reversible cause of mortality and morbidity if sources and cases can be identified. The elderly have been shown to be particularly at risk. Concerns continue to be raised about potential unrecognised cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. These concerns arise from difficulties in knowing who to suspect as a potential victim of poisoning as well as how, when and what to test. In general carbon monoxide has no helpful unique clinical presentation and is known to mimic common illnesses as well as exacerbate established diseases. As a gas it is undetectable by the human senses and is potentially present in most households. This paper reviews the issues associated with carbon monoxide poisoning including pointers to early diagnosis and discussion of pathophysiology and management.

### Factors associated with non-fatal heart failure and atrial fibrillation or flutter within the first 30 days post COPD exacerbation: a nested case-control study [^35a8e5f0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) likely due to linked pathophysiology, hypoxic state, and an amplified systemic inflammatory response. Previous studies have demonstrated an increased, immediate period of risk for hospitalized cardiovascular events following a COPD exacerbation compared with non-exacerbating patients, with the risk highest within the first month and following a severe (hospitalized) exacerbation. The 30 day risk of arrhythmias and heart failure (HF) following an exacerbation, approach or even surpass 3-fold, compared to those who did not have an exacerbation.

Globally, the prevalence of HF in COPD is high, and, of patients hospitalized for exacerbation, 20% have existing, undertreated HF. Incident HF attributed to exacerbations is thought to come from the increase in pulmonary arterial pressures, low blood oxygen levels and activation of adrenoceptors of the autonomic nervous system. However, shared symptomology of HF and COPD exacerbations makes new HF diagnosis difficult, with HF often missed or occurring in tandem; approximately 8% of people primarily diagnosed with HF also have a secondary diagnosis of exacerbation. Studies have investigated COPD progression in HF and conversely, HF progression across COPD phenotypes, but few have focused on exacerbating COPD alone and no studies have examined factors associated with hospitalization with a HF diagnosis following a COPD exacerbation.

Arrhythmias are also common among people with COPD, with prevalence ranging from 5 to 15% globally, and atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. AF diagnoses at the time of an exacerbation are also common, with estimates around 17%, but due to shared, nonspecific symptoms between AF and COPD, differential diagnosis can be difficult. During a COPD exacerbation, changes in blood gases from hypoxia and rising pulmonary pressure can lead to electrophysiological and structural changes of the atrium, and together are thought to contribute to exacerbation-related disturbances in rhythm and progression of AF [,,–] The understanding of COPD progression alongside AF progression is unclear. Few studies have examined factors associated with hospitalization for incident AF after an exacerbation, with the focus on the short-term. Several have however investigated factors associated with concurrent AF at time of an exacerbation.

Therefore, using a primary-care defined COPD cohort from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database linked with hospital, mortality, and socioeconomic deprivation data, we explored factors associated with incident hospitalization for non-fatal HF, or AF or atrial flutter, within the 30 days following a COPD exacerbation.

### Application of smart devices in investigating the effects of air pollution on atrial fibrillation onset [^37ea6290]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide case-crossover study, we provide robust evidence that hourly exposure to ambient PM 10, PM 2.5, NO 2, and CO (but not SO 2 and O 3) can significantly increase the risk of AF onset. By virtue of real-time AF screening from smart devices, we are able to examine the impact of air pollutants on the onset of AF episodes at the hourly level, and we identify a lag of 18–24 h as the critical time window for the effects of air pollution exposure. The exposure-response relationship curves for the four pollutants are almost linear without any discernible thresholds. The associations are also robust to the adjustment of co-pollutants. These risks are larger among females, older people, and during cool seasons.

Although previous studies have examined the acute effects of air pollutants on AF incidence, the results are generally mixed, especially for various air pollutants. For example, a meta-analysis found statistically significant associations between increased risk of AF and per unit increase in PM 2.5 [0.89% (95%CI: 0.20%, 1.57%)], NO 2 [1.19% (95%CI: 0.70%, 1.67%), and CO [0.60% (95%CI: 0.20%,1.09%)]. Fang et al. conducted a time-series study in Yancheng, China; they found a 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 was associated with a 2.81% (95%CI: 1.44%, 4.20%) change in AF hospitalization, and the estimate was 1.67% (95%CI: 0.77%, 2.59%) for PM 10, 4.90% (95%CI: 1.69%, 8.22%) for NO 2, and 2.55% (95%CI: 0.91%, 4.21%) for CO (per 0.1 mg/m 3). However, in Bunch et al.’s case-crossover study in Utah, a null association between AF hospitalization and PM 2.5 exposure was found. In the present study, the effects of air pollutants (per IQR increase) on AF were strongest for NO 2 (OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.16, 2.20), followed by CO (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.19, 1.84), PM 2.5 (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.14, 1.67) and PM 10 (OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.37); whereas the effects for SO 2 and O 3 were not significant. The heterogeneity in these findings may be due to the differences in population susceptibility, sample size, air pollution levels, exposure patterns, statistical models, and outcome assessment. Besides, the present study adopted the case-crossover design using individual cases, which has a greater capacity for causal inference. More importantly, contrary to previous studies, our study could capture the exact timing of AF onsets and included paroxysmal AF events. AF is an instant cardiac arrhythmia or one-time electrical disorder within a very short time. Thus, emergency-room visits or hospitalization behavior are likely to miss the critical time window of AF onset. In the current study, we utilized a smart device-based screening technology to detect all AF episodes in real-time. In this way, we were able to explore the associations more comprehensively between air pollution and AF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 data standards—PASC atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter refers to AF or atrial flutter in a patient without prior history of atrial tachyarrhythmias that started during probable or confirmed acute COVID-19 and persisted beyond 4 wk after the initial diagnosis of COVID-19; preexisting cardiovascular conditions, or those that did not develop until after COVID-19 had resolved, should not be listed here.

### Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^687c1939]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is widely accepted as a treatment for air or gas embolism, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis, crush injuries, and thermal burns. To the best of our knowledge, after HBO therapy, atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been reported in the literature yet. We herein describe a case of AF that occurred in a woman who had taken HBO therapy for CO poisoning. The 78-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with less of consciousness. Carboxyhemoglobin value at arterial blood gases was found to be 42.6% and was thought to be CO poisoning. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal sinus rhythm. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was planned. After the HBO therapy, ECG showed AF. Her rhythm returned to the normal sinus rhythm after amiodarone treatment. Physicians should keep in mind that HBO treatment could contribute to AF, and all patients' ECG should be monitored before and after HBO therapy.

### Breathless nights and heart flutters: understanding the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation [^1f1a37c0]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

There is an extraordinary and increasing global burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), two conditions that frequently accompany one another and that share underlying risk factors. Whether a causal pathophysiologic relationship connects OSA to the development and/or progression of AF, or whether shared risk factors promote both conditions, is unproven. With increasing recognition of the importance of controlling AF-related risk factors, numerous observational studies now highlight the potential benefits of OSA treatment in AF-related outcomes. Physicians are regularly faced with caring for this important and increasing population of patients despite a paucity of clinical guidance on the topic. Here, we review the clinical epidemiology and pathophysiology of AF and OSA with a focus on key clinical studies and major outstanding questions that should be addressed in future studies.

### Cumulative lifetime burden of cardiovascular disease from early exposure to air pollution [^69378f10]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Arrhythmias

Arrhythmia is another potential manifestation of air pollution exposure that could lead to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 98 Adults having had a smoking parent during gestational development and those living with a smoker during childhood were each significantly associated with atrial fibrillation, which was more pronounced among adults without risk factors for atrial fibrillation. 62 In a study of 100 adults exposed over to PM 2.5 and PM 10 over several months, an increased risk of atrial fibrillation was seen. 63 In another study of 281 patients (mean 71 years) exposed to PM 10 and PM 2.5 followed for 1 year, 64 ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation correlated significantly with PM 2.5 (P <0.001) but not PM 10. In these older adults, an analysis of the ventricular fibrillation episodes alone correlated significantly with higher PM 2.5 and PM 10 exposure. Finally, Xu et al 65 followed 73 healthy young adults living in China under continuous pollution (particulates 5–560 nm diameter, black carbon, NO 2, CO, SO 2, and O 3) using 24‐hour electrocardiographic recordings, and found that the young participants showed cardiac repolarization abnormalities (increased QTc interval), which were most strongly associated with nano‐sized PM, with traffic‐related pollutants (black carbon, NO 2, and CO), and with SO 2, and O 3. The associations were stronger in males who were overweight and had higher levels of C‐reactive protein levels.

Stroke

Evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated a strong association between air pollution and stroke. 99 Among 5417 confirmed strokes in 5224 women between 1993 and 2012 in Asia exposed daily to particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), NO 2, NO x, SO 2, and O 3, Sun et al 66 found a positive association between risk of hemorrhagic stroke and NO 2 and NO x but not with the other pollutants in the 3 days before a stroke. A 7‐year study in Korea showed significant associations between PM 2.5 and PM 10, NO 2, NO x, SO 2, and O 3 and the incidence of ischemic but not hemorrhagic stroke mortality, suggesting clinically significant alterations in the cerebrovascular system induced by air pollution. 67 Finally, in a study of 23 179 stoke admissions in Taiwan between 1997 and 2000, Tsai et al 68 reported significant positive associations between levels of PM 10, NO 2, SO 2, O 3, and CO and primary intracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemic stroke.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^1000c39c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning—future research priorities: Future research addressing acute myocardial injury from CO poisoning should focus on the role of cardiac testing and subsequent intervention in a less severely poisoned population, and studies could investigate the role of more aggressive initial and long-term cardiac management in patients known to be at higher risk for morbidity and mortality after CO toxicity.

### Long-term particulate matter exposure and incidence of arrhythmias: a cohort study [^b81c77ac]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation and Tachycardia

Short‐ and long‐term exposure to PM or gaseous air pollution, including PM 2.5, PM 10, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon dioxide (CO), ozone, and black carbon (BC) have been positively associated with AF and tachycardia. 18, 28 In our study, long‐term PM air pollution exposure was associated with an increased risk of AF and tachycardia, but the associations were not statistically significant. Possible reasons for the inconsistent associations across studies include: differences in sample size, study settings, air pollution levels, and pre‐existing conditions of the study populations.

In our study, 12‐month PM 2.5 had a stronger association than 36‐ or 60‐month PM 2.5 with atrial fibrillation and RBBB. This could attributable to a more robust association with a longer follow‐up time for 12‐month PM 2.5 analysis.

Interaction Effects

The positive association between air pollution and the risk of arrhythmias was more pronounced in participants ≥40 years of age, and in participants with higher levels of alcohol intake and lower levels of physical exercise. The mechanisms underlying these differences are unclear. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, or participants with underlying conditions, tend to be more susceptible to the effects of PM air pollution exposure, but these differences need to be confirmed in future studies. 10, 28, 29

### Acute exposure to air pollution triggers atrial fibrillation [^2bc3a7a0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the association of air pollution with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Air pollution in general and more specifically particulate matter has been associated with cardiovascular events. Although ventricular arrhythmias are traditionally thought to convey the increased cardiovascular risk, AF may also contribute.

Methods

Patients with dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were enrolled and followed prospectively. The association of AF onset with air quality including ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), black carbon, sulfate, particle number, NO2, SO2, and O3 in the 24 h prior to the arrhythmia was examined utilizing a case-crossover analysis. In sensitivity analyses, associations with air pollution between 2 and 48 h prior to the AF were examined.

Results

Of 176 patients followed for an average of 1.9 years, 49 patients had 328 episodes of AF lasting ≥ 30 s. Positive but nonsignificant associations were found for PM2.5 in the prior 24 h, but stronger associations were found with shorter exposure windows. The odds of AF increased by 26% (95% confidence interval: 8% to 47%) for each 6.0 μg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 in the 2 h prior to the event (p = 0.004). The odds of AF were highest at the upper quartile of mean PM2.5.

Conclusions

PM was associated with increased odds of AF onset within hours following exposure in patients with known cardiac disease. Air pollution is an acute trigger of AF, likely contributing to the pollution-associated adverse cardiac outcomes observed in epidemiological studies.

### Drug-induced arrhythmias: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^962b59b1]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Many widely used medications may cause or exacerbate a variety of arrhythmias. Numerous antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobial drugs, psychotropic medications, and methadone, as well as a growing list of drugs from other therapeutic classes (neurological drugs, anticancer agents, and many others), can prolong the QT interval and provoke torsades de pointes. Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed. Awareness of drugs that may cause arrhythmias and knowledge of distinct arrhythmias that may be drug-induced are essential for clinicians. Consideration of the possibility that a patient's arrythmia could be drug-induced is important.

### Carbon monoxide and prognosis in smokers hospitalised with acute cardiac events: a multicentre, prospective cohort study [^fd9017dd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study of a multi-centre cohort of consecutive patients admitted to ICCUs for acute cardiac events with systematic assessment of expiratory CO level on admission, we found that elevated expiratory CO levels were strongly and independently associated with a 6-fold increase of 1-year death in active smokers with a cut-off value of CO > 11 ppm. Elevated CO levels were associated with a 10-fold increase in-hospital MAEs. In the overall population of patients, a CO > 11 ppm but not smoking was associated with a significant increase in 1-year death. Finally, the incremental prognostic value of CO was better than smoking for determining death in the overall population. There was no interaction for this association with geographic regions of the centres, socio economic status or other parameters of smoking consumption.

This is the first study to describe the association between elevated CO level and the prognosis of smokers hospitalised for an acute cardiac event. A potential relationship between elevated CO levels and the prognosis of cardiac events has been suggested in 3 previous studies; Cohen et al. found an increased rate of fatalities among cases of myocardial infarction during periods of high CO pollution–Leikin et al. correlated carboxyhaemoglobin levels with acute cardiac complaints in patients presenting at an emergency department.Finally, Elsasser et al. found that patients with myocardial infarction and elevated carboxyhaemoglobin have more arrhythmias and higher creatine kinase levels.

CO's affinity for haemoglobin is more than 200 times that of oxygen.CO causes hypoxia by forming carboxy-haemoglobin and shifting the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the left with even relatively low amounts of inhaled carbon monoxide.The World Health Organisation has indicated that a CO level >50 ppm for 30 min, >25 ppm for 1 h or >10 ppm for 8 h can be associated with significant medical damage.Our CO level threshold >11 ppm is in the range of CO poisoning.

### Carbon monoxide and prognosis in smokers hospitalised with acute cardiac events: a multicentre, prospective cohort study [^732922f4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of CO poisoning on the cardiovascular system have been largely described; elevated CO levels are associated with myocardial injury, reduced left ventricular function and cardiovascular death.The excess of mortality found in our study in patients with elevated CO levels could result in myocardial injury from CO poisoning with tissue hypoxia as well as damage at the cellular level. Then, the coexistence of CO poisoning with an acute cardiac event could easily explain the initial excess of events found in our study. It is important to notice that there was a strong relationship between CO level, MAE and the delay of last cigarette but not with the number of packs year suggesting that CO has a direct role more than smoking history. Indeed, we found that CO level was the only “smoking related parameter” associated with 1-year mortality.

The increased rate of death during the months following the initial event could be explained in many ways: first, a greater severity of the initial event linked to CO poisoning could be followed with a higher rate of subsequent events during follow-up. Second, it has been shown in several studies that the rate of tobacco abstinence after discharge for an acute event is low ranging from 16 to 45%. Patients with elevated CO levels also have the highest dependence scores—they probably find it harder to stop and likely continue to smoke more heavily after discharge, leading to an even higher death rate in the longer term. The occurrence of a new event could also be associated with a higher rate of death due to another concomitant CO poisoning. Third, we cannot exclude that chronic CO poisoning could induce myocardial injury per se and subsequent events in patients with previous cardiac disease. For all those mechanisms, it is important to remember that changing smoking behaviour after an acute cardiac event in those patients would have a strong impact to reduce death during follow-up.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline characteristics

In this study, we enrolled a total of 413 eligible patients with acute CO poisoning and myocardial injury. Among them, 61 (14.8%) patients exhibited cardiovascular events, including 26 cases of atrial fibrillation requiring drug intervention, 5 ventricular tachycardia cases, 17 heart failure cases, 6 sudden death cases, 3 deaths due to multiple organ failure, and 4 cases of chest pain combined with myocardial infarction‐like electrocardiography changes. These 61 patients were assigned to the event group, while the remaining 352 patients were assigned to the non‐event group (Table 1).

TABLE 1 
Baseline characteristics

Moreover, coma duration in the event group was significantly longer than that of the non‐event group (p = 0.032). Likewise, the APACHE II score of the event group was significantly higher compared with that of the non‐event group (p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of gender, age, incidence of endotracheal intubation, number of patients with hypertension, and number of patients with diabetes.

### Atrial flutter associated with carboplatin administration [^3c5c06c0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a novel case of atrial flutter associated with carboplatin administration and review chemotherapy-related cardiac toxicities, focusing on platinum-containing compounds.

Case Report

A 69-year-old man with extensive small cell lung cancer and asymptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was inconsistently adherent to his medication regimen. While undergoing carboplatin infusion, he developed atrial flutter. He had no other immediate arrhythmogenic causes of atrial flutter and the arrhythmia spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm after 24 hours. His condition remained stable until he died 8 days later. The cause of death was unknown and the family declined postmortem examination.

Discussion

Although this patient's cardiac history and nonadherence to his medications may have increased his susceptibility to develop atrial arrhythmias, the Naranjo probability scale reveals a possible relationship between atrial flutter and infusion of carboplatin. A literature search revealed other adverse cardiac events due to platinum compounds; however, to our knowledge, this case is the first to describe an association with atrial flutter. A definitive causal link cannot be determined, but this may have been the result of a direct arrhythmogenic effect of treatment or to a novel hypersensitivity reaction. Given the potential deleterious impact of drug-induced arrhythmias, we have reported this case to the Food and Drug Administration as a new adverse effect of carboplatin.

Conclusions

Providers should consider cardiac monitoring during carboplatin infusion in patients with known cardiac disease or at high risk of cardiac complications.

### A new marker for myocardial injury in carbon monoxide poisoning: T peak-T end [^5895c9b8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning frequently affects repolarization, resulting in abnormal electrocardiography findings. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of CO poisoning on the novel transmyocardial repolarization parameters T peak-T end (Tp-e), Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QT and the relationship of these parameters to myocardial injury (MI).

Methods

This prospective study included 94 patients with CO poisoning and 40 healthy controls. Participants received an electrocardiography and had their blood drawn at admission and 6 and 24 hours after admission. The QT, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, and the Tp-e/QT ratio were calculated. Myocardial injury was determined based on an elevation in troponin any time during the first 24 hours. The patients were divided into 2 subgroups: those with and without MI.

Results

T peak-T end, Tp-e dispersion, and the Tp-e/QT ratio were higher at admission than after 6 and 24 hours of hospitalization and were higher than the control group (P < .001). There was a correlation between the carboxyhemoglobin level at admission and Tp-e and Tp-e dispersion (P < .001). The MI subgroup (n = 14) had a higher Tp-e at admission than did the non-MI subgroup (n = 80) (96 [11] milliseconds vs 87 [12] milliseconds, P = .03). There were no any significant differences in the Tp-e dispersion or the Tp-e/QT ratio between the 2 MI subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a Tp-e cutoff value for MI of 91.5 milliseconds had a sensitivity of 72.7% and a specificity of 67.2%.

Conclusion

Transmyocardial repolarization parameters indicative of arrhythmia were prolonged in patients with CO poisoning. T peak-T end was associated with MI.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study participants

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with moderate to severe acute CO poisoning‐associated myocardial injury, who had been admitted at the Department of Emergency or Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) of Harrison International Peace Hospital between November, 2015 and February, 2020. Moderate to severe acute CO poisoning was diagnosed by the criteria of occupational acute carbon monoxide poisoning GBZ23‐2002, 13 while myocardial injury was diagnosed in conformity with the diagnostic criteria for occupational acute toxic cardiopathy caused by chemicals GBZ 74–2009. 14 Patients were eligible for this study if they had a history of CO exposure, with coma symptoms, positive cardiac troponin I (cTnI) after 3 hours of admission, and admitted to the hospital within 24 hours of acute CO poisoning onset.

The exclusion criteria were: (a). Patients younger than 18 years, with acute pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation, or other cardiovascular events; (b) Patients with autoimmune diseases, such as, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis; (c) Those who had been administered with immunosuppressive drug within 3 months before enrollment; (d) Patients with coronary heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, or chronic cardiac insufficiency; (e) Patients with bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary interstitial fibrosis; (f) Those with hematological diseases; (g) Those with serious infections at admission; and (h). Those with a malignant tumor.

2.2 Procedures

All patients were subjected to electrocardiographic monitoring (24‐h rhythm recording), oxygen inhalation, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Those who could not receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy were given intermittent ventilator assisted pure oxygen inhalation in order to prevent and treat brain edema and myocardial nutrition.

Subsequently, the patients were assigned into two categories, event and non‐event groups, based on whether adverse cardiovascular events occurred or not within 1 month after hospital admission. The cardiovascular events included serious arrhythmia, heart failure, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, as well as all‐cause death. Serious arrhythmia was defined as newly emerging symptoms after admission, such as, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and atrioventricular block recorded using electrocardiography. Notably, if two or more events occurred at the same time or in succession, the events would only be recorded once.

### Association between family history and early-onset atrial flutter across racial and ethnic groups [^d36198d6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial flutter (AFL) follows second only to atrial fibrillation (AF) as the most common arrhythmia in the world, with >200 000 incidence cases diagnosed yearly in the United States.However, little is known about the epidemiological differences between the two. Clinically, both can be managed with antiarrhythmic therapy, anticoagulation, or catheter ablation strategies.However, AFL differs from AF in that it is more difficult to rate control; cavo‐tricuspid‐isthmus dependent AFL has a higher success rate with ablation, often has a regular rhythm, and has a lower risk of stroke.In contrast with the well‐defined clinical features, characteristics, and genetic basis for AF,the current understanding of risk factors and role of family history of atrial tachyarrhythmias in first‐degree relatives (FDRs) toward the development of early‐onset atrial flutter (EOAFL) is limited.Similarly, the role that race and ethnicity play is unknown, which is particularly important in the context of the paradoxically lower rate of AF seen in Black individuals despite a similar or increased burden of clinical risk factors.

The overlap in risk factors for AFL and AF are often confounded, as the 2 diagnoses are often combined in a majority of studies,,,,with few studies attempting to distinguish between the two. Marcus et alfound that alcohol intake was associated with AFL in younger patients; however, this association did not carry over to AF. The largest study before this found a 2‐ to 3‐fold increase in the risk of AFL in men, those with heart failure, and those with obstructive pulmonary disease.However, these studies at this time stand in conflict with each other, such as the lack of association between AFL and heart failure found in a recent meta‐analysis.

Here, we sought to elucidate the underlying risk factors for AFL, with a particular focus on familial and race‐specific determinants. We evaluated the uncomplicated diagnosis of EOAFL with few comorbidities as compared with the more comorbid, later diagnosis of AFL (late‐onset atrial flutter [LOAFL]) to elucidate the characteristics that are more directly associated with AFL. We hypothesized that EOAFL is more common in those with a family history of atrial tachyarrhythmias and that there will be differences in incidence across race and ethnicity similar to differences in seen in AF.We also examined the relationship between other potential modifiable risk factors with the diagnosis of EOAFL versus LOAFL.

4.3 Volatile Substances and Heart Failure

There is not much literature about how volatile substances affect heart failure. We will talk about a few cases here.

In a 14‐year‐old male patient who had sniffed chronic trichloroethylene (dry cleaning fluid), atrial flutter was observed in conjunction with congestive cardiomyopathy. After the cessation of exposure, his condition improved. The author suggested that trichloroethylene might enhance the effects of catecholamines and postulated that cardiomyopathy could have an ischemic origin. In another report, the first patient, who sniffed 1,1,1‐trichloroethane before, had VF during surgery when given halothane, which is similar to what he was exposed to. He had mild heart failure after that. The second case, a patient with mild, stable heart failure from being exposed to 1,1,1‐trichloroethane at work, had end‐stage heart failure when given halothane for hernia surgery. The author pointed out the possible toxic effect of halothane on people who were exposed to 1,1,1‐trichloroethane before.

Several researchers have previously reported that thinner, due to coronary vasospasm, can lead to apparent ischemia, resulting in myocardial infarction and/or ventricular fibrillation. In these patients, the resistance to defibrillation and the occurrence of recurrent ventricular fibrillation attacks, despite antiarrhythmic treatment, are noteworthy. Beyond ischemia resulting from vasospasm, it is suggested that toluene's direct cardiotoxic effects also play a role in the development of arrhythmias. In the case of thinner‐induced cardiomyopathy, it is believed that thinner contributed to the development of cardiomyopathy by causing silent ischemia through vasospasm. The matter of why some cases of volatile substance abuse lead to evident ischemia while others silently progress to cardiomyopathy remains unknown. However, the amount of the substance, how long they are exposed, and some genetic and environmental factors that enhance the cardiotoxic effects of the substance may play a role in these different responses.

### The environmental epidemiology of atrial arrhythmogenesis [^f1741376]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2010). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia seen in clinical practice, and makes an important contribution to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The focus of AF research has recently shifted, from concentrating on treatments and complications, to the evaluation of putative risk factors including ambient air pollution. Although the present study pertains specifically to AF, much of its content is drawn from, and therefore is applicable to, the study of other arrhythmias, the conduct of which is confronted by many of the same challenges. Meeting these challenges involves recognising the collective importance of 1. large, ethnically and geographically diverse, clinically well-characterised populations; 2. methods for reducing uncertainty in outcome ascertainment, distinguishing effects of pervasive environmental exposures and improving their estimation; 3. approaches to evaluation of susceptibility; and 4. strategies for informing regulatory policies designed to help control population-level risks for CVD.

### Pulmonary thromboembolism after carbon monoxide poisoning [^8dfa4d3c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is known to increase thrombotic tendency, and the risk of deep vein thrombosis in individuals who have experienced CO poisoning is higher than in the general population. However, there are a few reports describing cases of pulmonary thromboembolisms (PTE) secondary to CO poisoning.

Data Sources

Retrospective data analysis.

Study Selection

Seven hundred fifty bed tertiary university affiliated hospital.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Five patients with PTE after CO poisoning were observed. Two patients experienced cardiac arrest; they were treated successfully with tissue plasminogen activators and targeted temperature management. Their cerebral performance scores at discharge were both 1. Three patients had PTE and were treated with anticoagulation.

Conclusions

To date, the causal relationship between PTE and CO poisoning is unclear. However, PTE should be considered in patients with CO poisoning as a differential diagnosis when unexplained hypoxemia or shock are observed. Further studies on the association between CO poisoning and PTE are warranted.

Sodium channel blockers—clinical cautions and toxicity considerations include that in large clinical trials sodium channel blockers increased mortality among patients convalescing from MI, and based on CAST flecainide is contraindicated in patients with ischemia, prior MI, and is avoided in patients with other structural heart diseases. Sodium channel blockers increase defibrillation energy requirement and pacing thresholds, so patients may require reprogramming or revision of pacing or ICD systems or changes in their medication regimens, and they can convert AF to slow atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction with wide QRS complexes that can be confused with VT. Procainamide and flecainide can occasionally precipitate the typical Brugada syndrome ECG, this has been reported not only with antiarrhythmic medications but also with tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine, and whether this represents unmasking or a broad spectrum of responses is unknown. In the setting of sodium-channel blocker toxicity, limited animal data suggest that administration of sodium, as sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, may improve conduction slowing or suppress frequent or cardioversion-resistant VT, and successful treatment with beta blockers and intravenous fat emulsion and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has also been reported.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning [^0f228422]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

CO is an insidious poison with many sources of exposure. CO poisoning produces diverse signs and symptoms, which often are subtle and can be misdiagnosed easily. Failure to diagnose CO poisoning may result insignificant morbidity and mortality and allow continued exposure to a dangerous environment. In the ED, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for occult CO exposure. Headache, particularly when associated with certain environments, and flulike illness in the wintertime with symptomatic cohabitants should raise the index of suspicion in the ED significantly for occult CO poisoning. Emergency treatment of CO poisoning begins with inhalation of supplemental oxygen and aggressive supportive care. HBOT accelerates dissociation of CO from hemoglobin and may prevent DNS. Absolute indications for HBOT for CO poisoning remain controversial, although most would agree that HBOT is indicated in patients who are comatose, are neurologically abnormal, have a history of loss of consciousness with their exposure, or have cardiac dysfunction. Pregnancy with an elevated CO-Hgb level (>15-20%) also is widely considered an indication for treatment. HBOT may be considered in patients who have persistent symptoms despite NBO, metabolic acidosis, abnormalities on neuropsychometric testing, or significantly elevated levels. The ideal regimen of oxygen therapy has yet to be determined, and significant controversy exists regarding HBOT protocols. The emergency physician may be confronted with the difficult decision regarding disposition and even transfer to a hyperbaric facility. Often the local medical toxicologist, poison control center, or hyperbaric unit can assist the emergency physician with the decision-making process.

### Association of intravenous potassium and magnesium administration with spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department [^c9a87c65]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the administration of potassium and magnesium associated with the probability of spontaneous conversion of nonpermanent atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 2546 episodes of atrial fibrillation and 573 episodes of atrial flutter, administration of potassium and magnesium was associated with higher rates of spontaneous conversion in atrial fibrillation vs no administration (19.2% vs 10.4%) during patients’ stay in the emergency department. However, there was no association with atrial flutter (13.0% vs 12.5%).

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that administration of potassium and magnesium might lessen the need for antiarrhythmic therapy and the potential adverse effects in patients with nonpermanent atrial fibrillation.

### Recognition and prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning (...) [^84d2826a]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

About 600 accidental deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning occur each year, making it one of the most common causes of morbidity from poisoning in the United States. About five to 10 times as many intentional deaths from carbon monoxide are reported. Exposure occurs from a variety of sources, particularly motor vehicle exhaust. The number of accidental deaths caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from motor vehicle exhaust is higher in the North and peaks during the winter months. Ernst and Zibrak reviewed the clinical aspects of carbon monoxide poisoning, including signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, treatment and prevention strategies. The clinical signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are nonspecific and are often mistaken for a simple viral illness. Patients typically present with tachycardia and tachypnea, and may complain of headache, nausea and vomiting.

However, patients rarely have the classic findings of cyanosis, retinal hemorrhage and cherry-red lips. Symptom severity ranges from mild to severe and is not associated with serum levels of carboxyhemoglobin, although duration of exposure is an important factor. Not all patients exhibit signs and symptoms immediately after exposure. In some patients, neuropsychiatric symptoms, including cognitive and personality changes, may develop anywhere from three days to eight months after exposure. The mechanism for these conditions is unknown, but hypoxia alone is not sufficient to explain the observed clinical manifestations. Because carbon monoxide poisoning has no pathognomonic signs or symptoms, a high level of suspicion is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Measuring the level of carbon monoxide in the exhaled air of a patient can be diagnostic, but a blood sample should be obtained to measure carboxyhemoglobin levels and any coexisting acidosis. A detailed neurologic examination, including psychologic testing, is recommended to document any abnormal findings, which are often subtle. The Carbon Monoxide Neuropsychological Screening Battery is a frequently used tool that takes about 30 minutes to administer and helps to establish a baseline for assessing the patient's mental status. The most important steps in treatment are removing the patient from the source of poisoning and administering 100 percent oxygen. Oxygen should be given until the patient's carboxyhemoglobin level returns to normal. Hospitalization should also be considered for patients with severe poisoning or serious underlying medical problems. Indications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy are not clear, except that it is undisputedly indicated in unconscious patients.

### Atrial fibrillation after taser exposure in a previously healthy adolescent [^16a0b3ab]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

We are reporting a previously healthy adolescent who developed atrial fibrillation after being tased. He has a structurally normal heart on echocardiogram, normal electrolyte level and thyroid function test results, and a urine toxicology screen positive for marijuana. The patient ultimately required external defibrillation to convert his cardiac rhythm to normal sinus rhythm and has had no recurrent arrhythmias since hospital discharge (approximately 1 year). This is the first reported case of atrial fibrillation developing after a Taser shot, occurring in an adolescent without other risk factors. This case illustrates the arrhythmogenic potential of a Taser in otherwise healthy young individuals, and further study of occurrence of Taser-induced arrhythmias is warranted.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—propafenone for cardioversion: reported cardioversion of recent-onset AF ranged from 56% to 83%, and oral propafenone was as efficacious as flecainide but superior to oral amiodarone and quinidine plus digoxin. Limited data suggest reduced efficacy in patients with persistent AF, in conversion of atrial flutter, and in patients with structural heart disease. Adverse effects are uncommon but include rapid atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, intraventricular conduction disturbances, hypotension, and bradycardia on conversion. Available data on propafenone loading in organic heart disease are scant; this agent should be used cautiously or not at all for conversion of AF in such cases and should be avoided in patients with HF or severe obstructive lung disease.

### Association between atrial fibrillation and occupational exposure in firefighters based on self-reported survey data [^094ff69d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between increased exposure (based on the number of fires fought per year) and increased prevalence of AF as well as several other cardiac and medical diagnoses. The mechanism for this correlation is almost certainly multifactorial, with stress response, long work hours, inhaled exposure to products of combustion, smoke inhalation, and strong activation of the sympathetic nervous system all playing a role.

Prior studies have demonstrated an increased risk of CVD among FF. CVD has been documented at autopsy in a large fraction of duty‐related deaths in FF, which has been attributed to personal risk factors as well as job‐related factors including exposure to products of combustion, strenuous work, and the sympathetic nervous system activation associated with responding to emergencies.,Occupational stress has also been correlated with the development of CVD and sleep disorders in FF in particular.A study of FF with greater exposure to the World Trade Center fires in New York after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks demonstrated that they had a 44% increased risk for the primary outcome of the study, which was composed of myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, revascularization, or cardiovascular death.Our findings build on this established knowledge of the clustering of CVD and its risk factors in FF.

### Temporal trends in cause-specific mortality among individuals with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation in the framingham heart study [^d8b239fd]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used data from participants with incident AF in the FHS. Because AF is diagnosed over a wide range of ages and because the distribution of causes of death may differ according to age at AF diagnosis, we classified AF cases into three pre-specified groups of age at AF diagnosis: < 70 years, 70 to < 80 years, and ≥ 80 years. In each group of age at AF diagnosis, we examined the trends in cause-specific mortality over three pre-specified epochs: AF diagnosis < 1990, between 1990 and 2002, and ≥ 2003. We also assessed the predictors of cause-specific death.

Data sources

We analyzed data from the FHS Original Cohort, which enrolled 5209 participants between 1948 and 1953; the Offspring Cohort with 5124 participants enrolled in 1971–1975; Omni 1 Cohort with 506 participants in 1994–1998; Third-Generation Cohort with 4095 participants enrolled in 2002–2005; New Offspring Spouse Cohort with 171 participants in 2003–2005; and Omni 2 Cohort with 410 participants enrolled in 2003–2005. The FHS protocols are reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center, and all participants provided informed consent.

Participants and atrial fibrillation definition

We included all FHS participants with newly diagnosed AF. We did not include participants with prevalent AF at enrollment (n = 141). We combined atrial flutter with AF. At least two FHS cardiologists adjudicated AF or atrial flutter that was observed by electrocardiograms from FHS research examinations, participants’ medical appointments, or hospital records. FHS personnel contacted hospitals and medical clinics to collect the participants’ medical records. We further defined secondary AF as AF associated with an acute reversible precipitant at the time of diagnosis, including acute myocardial infarction (within 30 days), acute cardiothoracic surgery (within 30 days), thyrotoxicosis, acute alcohol intoxication, acute infection, or acute pulmonary pathology.

Atrial fibrillation—causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

Sodium channel blockers—risk profile and toxicity management include that procainamide and flecainide can occasionally precipitate the typical Brugada syndrome ECG, reported not only with antiarrhythmic medications but also with tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine, and whether this represents unmasking of clinically unapparent Brugada syndrome or a broader response spectrum is unknown. In large clinical trials these agents increased mortality among patients convalescing from MI; based on CAST, flecainide is contraindicated in patients with ischemia, prior MI, and is avoided in patients with other structural heart diseases. Sodium channel blockers increase defibrillation energy requirement and pacing thresholds, may necessitate reprogramming or revision of pacing or ICD systems, and can convert AF to slow atrial flutter with 1 : 1 atrioventricular conduction and wide QRS complexes that can be confused with VT. In sodium‑channel blocker toxicity, administration of sodium (sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate) may improve conduction slowing or suppress frequent or cardioversion‑resistant VT, and successful treatment with beta blockers and intravenous fat emulsion and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been reported.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias—electrocardiographic classification specifies: Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is “Three or more beats in duration, terminating spontaneously in less than 30 s,” and VT is defined as “a cardiac arrhythmia of three or more consecutive complexes in duration emanating from the ventricles at a rate of greater than 100 bpm (cycle length less than 600 ms).” Nonsustained VT may be monomorphic (“Nonsustained VT with a single QRS morphology”) or polymorphic (“Nonsustained VT with a changing QRS morphology at cycle length between 600 and 180 ms”). Sustained VT is “VT greater than 30 s in duration and/or requiring termination due to hemodynamic compromise in less than 30 s,” with monomorphic (“Sustained VT with a stable single QRS morphology”) and polymorphic (“Sustained VT with a changing or multiform QRS morphology at cycle length between 600 and 180 ms”) forms. Additional entities include bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia (“VT due to re-entry involving the His-Purkinje system, usually with LBBB morphology; this usually occurs in the setting of cardiomyopathy”), bidirectional VT (“VT with a beat-to-beat alternans in the QRS frontal plane axis, often associated with digitalis toxicity”), torsades de pointes (long QT/QTc with twisting QRS; “Typical”, initiated following “short-long-short” coupling; short-coupled variant from normal-short coupling), and ventricular flutter described as a regular monomorphic ventricular arrhythmia with no isoelectric interval between successive QRS complexes.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter—recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Current guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.1 2 An important, under-recognised complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.

At a glance
- Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled.
- Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like. ” If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning.

Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100, 000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14, 000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven.

Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented. If you drive a car or SUV with a tailgate, when you open the tailgate open the vents or windows to make sure air is moving through. If only the tailgate is open, CO from the exhaust will be pulled into the car or SUV.

### Myth busting in carbon monoxide poisoning [^6e743455]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The evidence supporting many beliefs in medicine is based upon opinion, personal experience, hearsay, or "common knowledge." When one searches for the data supporting oft-quoted facts in medicine, they are sometimes found to be old, incorrect, or nonexistent. Such unsupported facts or beliefs can be termed myths. This minireview will summarize 4 examples of "myth busting" by the author when he has discovered widely held beliefs regarding carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning to be untrue during a 25-year career of research in the field. These include the mistaken beliefs that (1) symptoms correlate with presenting blood carboxyhemoglobin levels, (2) residents are safe from CO poisoning if their home does not contain fuel-burning appliances, (3) carboxyhemoglobin levels must be measured rapidly and on arterial blood, and (4) CO poisoning predisposes to premature long-term death from cardiac disease. In addition to providing the evidence disproving these myths, the importance of going back to the original reference when citing prior work is emphasized.

### Theophylline anhydrous (Elixophyllin) [^e8bea3cc]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions associated with theophylline are generally mild when peak serum theophylline concentrations are <20 mcg/mL and mainly consist of transient caffeine-like adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and insomnia. When peak serum theophylline concentrations exceed 20 mcg/mL, however, theophylline produces a wide range of adverse reactions including persistent vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and intractable seizures which can be lethal (see OVERDOSAGE). The transient caffeine-like adverse reactions occur in about 50% of patients when theophylline therapy is initiated at doses higher than recommended initial doses (e.g., >300 mg/day in adults and >12 mg/kg/day in children beyond >1 year of age). During the initiation of theophylline therapy, caffeine-like adverse effects may transiently alter patient behavior, especially in school age children, but this response rarely persists.

Initiation of theophylline therapy at a low dose with subsequent slow titration to a predetermined age-related maximum dose will significantly reduce the frequency of these transient adverse effects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table V). In a small percentage of patients (<3% of children and <10% of adults) the caffeine-like adverse effects persist during maintenance therapy, even at peak serum theophylline concentrations within the therapeutic range (i.e., 10-20 mcg/mL). Dosage reduction may alleviate  the caffeine-like adverse effects in these patients; however, persistent adverse effects should result in a reevaluation of the need for continued theophylline therapy and the potential therapeutic benefit of alternative treatment.

Other adverse reactions that have been reported at serum theophylline concentrations <20 mcg/mL include diarrhea, irritability, restlessness, fine skeletal muscle tremors, and transient diuresis. In patients with hypoxia secondary to COPD, multifocal atrial tachycardia and flutter have been reported at serum theophylline concentrations ≥15 mcg/mL. There have been a few isolated reports of seizures at serum theophylline concentrations <20 mcg/mL in patients with an underlying neurological disease or in elderly patients. The occurrence of seizures in elderly patients with serum theophylline concentrations <20 mcg/mL may be secondary to decreased protein binding resulting in a larger proportion of the total serum theophylline concentration in the pharmacologically active unbound form. The clinical characteristics of the seizures reported in patients with serum theophylline concentrations <20 mcg/mL have generally been milder than seizures associated with excessive serum theophylline concentrations resulting from an overdose (i.e., they have generally been transient, often stopped without anticonvulsant therapy, and did not result in neurological residua).

### Hiatal hernia squeezing the heart to flutter [^380d00a9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

An 80-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and weakness for 14 days. Medical history was significant for polio. On admission her electrocardiogram showed atrial flutter, and cardiac enzymes were elevated. Echocardiogram revealed a high pulmonary artery pressure, but no other wall motion abnormalities or valvulopathies. Chest x-ray showed a large lucency likely representing a diaphragmatic hernia. Computed tomographic scan confirmed the hernia. Our patient remained in atrial flutter despite rate control, and thereafter surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient. She underwent hernia repair. After surgery, the patient was taken off rate control and monitored for 72 hours; she did not have any episode of atrial flutter and was discharged with follow up in a week showing no arrhythmia. Her flutter was caused directly by the mechanical effect of the large hiatal hernia pressing against her heart, as the flutter resolved after the operation.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning: pathogenesis, management, and future directions of therapy [^1d0c2bb7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning affects 50,000 people a year in the United States. The clinical presentation runs a spectrum, ranging from headache and dizziness to coma and death, with a mortality rate ranging from 1 to 3%. A significant number of patients who survive CO poisoning suffer from long-term neurological and affective sequelae. The neurologic deficits do not necessarily correlate with blood CO levels but likely result from the pleiotropic effects of CO on cellular mitochondrial respiration, cellular energy utilization, inflammation, and free radical generation, especially in the brain and heart. Long-term neurocognitive deficits occur in 15-40% of patients, whereas approximately one-third of moderate to severely poisoned patients exhibit cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocardial infarction. Imaging studies reveal cerebral white matter hyperintensities, with delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy or diffuse brain atrophy. Management of these patients requires the identification of accompanying drug ingestions, especially in the setting of intentional poisoning, fire-related toxic gas exposures, and inhalational injuries. Conventional therapy is limited to normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen, with no available antidotal therapy. Although hyperbaric oxygen significantly reduces the permanent neurological and affective effects of CO poisoning, a portion of survivors still have substantial morbidity. There has been some early success in therapies targeting the downstream inflammatory and oxidative effects of CO poisoning. New methods to directly target the toxic effect of CO, such as CO scavenging agents, are currently under development.

### Atrial flutter: clinical risk factors and adverse outcomes in the framingham heart study [^d62ba781]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial flutter (flutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study.

Methods

We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models.

Results

During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03-1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05-4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26-21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (vs referents) was associated with 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14-7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42-6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90-8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13-4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44-2.79).

Conclusion

We identified the clinical correlates associated with flutter and observed that flutter was associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

### The poisoned heart: a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by carbon monoxide poisoning [^cfb682e8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbon monoxide is a common environmental toxin, and some patients present with features of cardiac injury in addition to the noxious effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. A very small fraction of those have a transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, both terms are used to define a syndrome that affects the systolic function of the heart. It usually presents with elevated troponin levels with or without electrocardiographic changes. Cardiac angiograms generally illustrate coronary arteries without significant obstruction.

Case Report

Here we report the curious case of a 37-year-old Hispanic man brought in for carbon monoxide poisoning, but found to have significantly elevated troponin levels. Echocardiogram demonstrated decreased ejection fraction of 35%. Left heart catheterization 2 days after admission revealed patent coronary arteries, improved ejection fraction to 45%, and wall motion abnormalities plus apical ballooning compatible with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The case is unusual because our patient differs from the classically defined elderly, postmenopausal female demographic, and did not experience an emotional crisis that could have provoked this series of events. It is also noteworthy for the fact that the only identifiable trigger was exposure to carbon monoxide. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Carbon monoxide poisoning is a common occurrence resulting in a multitude of annual emergency department visits. Given the known toxic effects of carbon monoxide poisoning on the heart, prompt cardiac workup is important to prevent overlooking a major, although rare, manifestation of carbon monoxide exposure.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—risks and precautions of direct-current cardioversion are primarily thromboembolism and arrhythmias, with thromboembolic events reported in 1% to 7% of patients not given prophylactic anticoagulation before cardioversion. Various benign arrhythmias may occur and subside spontaneously, but more dangerous arrhythmias can arise with hypokalemia, digitalis intoxication, or improper synchronization; serum potassium should be in the normal range. Magnesium supplementation does not enhance cardioversion. Cardioversion is contraindicated in digitalis toxicity; it is not routinely necessary to interrupt digoxin before elective cardioversion of AF, but clinicians should exclude signs of digitalis excess and delay cardioversion until corrected, which usually requires withdrawal of digoxin for longer than 24 h. In long-standing AF, cardioversion can unmask sinus node dysfunction; a slow ventricular response without AV nodal–slowing drugs may indicate intrinsic conduction disease, and a transvenous or transcutaneous pacemaker can be used prophylactically.

### A combination of NLR and sST2 is associated with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial injury induced by moderate to severe acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^ba97346a]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning‐induced myocardial injury is often neglected due to its hidden and reversible process. 1 Acute CO poisoning can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, such as, serious arrhythmia, acute heart failure, myocardial infarction, and even sudden death. 2, 3

Several different mechanisms by which acute CO poisoning may induce myocardial injury have been established. Firstly, the reduction in oxygen delivery caused by acute CO poisoning can be compensated by an increase in cardiac output and oxygen uptake; however, adverse cardiovascular events might occur when this is decompensated. Secondly, this poisoning can lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction, resulting in extensive endothelial dysfunction and, ultimately, cardiac function inhibition. 4 Thirdly, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can be destroyed by acute CO poisoning, which leads to myocardial stunning, resulting in cardiac function injury, arrhythmia, angina pectoris, and eventually acute myocardial infarction. 5, 6 Fourthly, this poisoning can lead to sympathetic nerve excitation that stimulates catecholamine production. The microvascular spasm or dysfunction induced by catecholamines can lead to either myocardial stunning or direct toxicity to myocardial cells. 4

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment algorithms and carboxyhemoglobin thresholds state that published CO poisoning treatment algorithms commonly attempt to risk-stratify patients to provide HBO2 only to those most likely to benefit, yet although the ability of carboxyhemoglobin levels to predict mortality, morbidity, or response to therapy is universally considered poor, various algorithms still recommend HBO2 if carboxyhemoglobin levels exceed 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40%, regardless of signs or symptoms.

Oxygen therapy and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) kinetics in CO poisoning indicate that administration of oxygen speeds elimination of CO; without therapy the elimination half-life of CO is 4 to 5 hours, with 100% oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure decreasing this to approximately 1 hour, and HBO2 further decreasing the half-life to 20 minutes at 2.5 atmospheres absolute pressure; based in part on these effects, HBO2 has been advocated as therapy for more than 40 years.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^f586d0de]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter: 
- Definition: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.
- Disease course: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

### Cardiac devices with class 1C antiarrhythmics: a potentially toxic combination [^3fc7c1ee]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A patient taking regular flecainide for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented with broad complex tachycardia and circulatory compromise. With no history of pacemaker insertion and no pacing spikes visible on the ECG, this was presumed to be ventricular tachycardia and treated with electrical cardioversion, leading to p-wave asystole. An indwelling pacemaker was now recognised and ventricular capture was eventually attained by significantly increasing ventricular lead output. Invasive haemodynamic support was required due to new ventricular systolic dysfunction. Pacing thresholds and ventricular function normalised within 72h consistent with flecainide toxicity; levels were shown to be toxic. Pacemaker interrogation revealed evidence of an undiagnosed atrial flutter, at presentation this was likely slowed by flecainide toxicity to a rate below the pacemaker mode switch, such that it was tracked in the ventricle at the upper tracking rate (120bpm). Cardioversion terminated the arrhythmia but raised the capture threshold of the ventricle above the maximum lead output.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a brief review [^d1f43b81]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is now a global pandemic affecting more than 12 million patients across 188 countries. A significant proportion of these patients require admission to intensive care units for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and are at an increased risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. The presence of underlying comorbidities, pathophysiologic changes imposed by the disease, and concomitant polypharmacy, increase the likelihood of life-threatening arrhythmias in these patients. Supraventricular, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, are common and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the interplay of various causal factors while instituting strategies to mitigate the impact of modifiable risk factors. Furthermore, avoidance and early recognition of drug interactions, along with prompt treatment, might help improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.

Conclusion

A proportion of patients with AIC continue to have subtle abnormalities of ventricular function, functional capacity and ventilation despite normalising LVEF after CA. These features may represent a precedent cardiomyopathic process that may be arrested by continuing HF medications. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger patient cohort.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—general antiarrhythmic drug therapy and monitoring: Before administering any antiarrhythmic agent, reversible precipitants of AF should be identified and corrected, and patients who develop HF in association with alcohol intake should abstain from alcohol consumption. When treatment with a single antiarrhythmic drug fails, combinations may be tried; useful combinations include a beta blocker, sotalol, or amiodarone with a class IC agent, and the combination of a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem, with a class IC agent, such as flecainide or propafenone, is advantageous in some patients. A drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic if coronary disease or HF develops or with interacting medications; thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of such symptoms as syncope, angina, or dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that might prolong the QT interval. With class IC drugs, prolongation of the QRS interval should not exceed 50%, and for class IA or class III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should be kept below 520 ms; exercise testing may help detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates. During follow-up, plasma potassium and magnesium levels and renal function should be checked periodically, and in individual patients, serial noninvasive assessment of LV function is indicated, especially when clinical HF develops during treatment of AF.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning and chronic kidney disease risk: a nationwide, population-based study [^1e298155]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) commonly have long-term morbidities. However, it is not known whether patients with COP exhibit an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) alters this risk.

Methods

This study identified 8,618 patients who survived COP and 34,464 propensity score-matched non-COP patients from 2000 to 2013 in a nationwide administrative registry. The primary outcome was the development of CKD. The association between COP and the risk of developing CKD was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model; the cumulated incidence of CKD among patients stratified by HBOT was evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

After adjusting for covariates, the risk of CKD was 6.15-fold higher in COP patients than in non-COP controls. Based on the subgroup analyses, regardless of demographic characteristics, environmental factors, and comorbidities, the COP cohort exhibited an increased risk of developing CKD compared with the controls. The cumulative incidence of CKD in COP patients did not differ between the HBOT and non-HBOT groups (p = 0.188).

Conclusions

COP might be an independent risk factor for developing CKD. Thus, clinicians should enhance the postdischarge follow-up of kidney function among COP patients.
