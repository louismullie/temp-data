## Question

A 52-year-old female was found upon mammography to have branching calcifications in the right lower breast. Physical exam revealed a palpable nodularity in the same location. A tissue biopsy was taken from the lesion, and the pathology report diagnosed the lesion as comedocarcinoma. Which of the following histological findings is most likely present in the lesion?
A. Orderly rows of cells surrounding lobules
B. Disordered glandular cells invading the ductal basement membrane
C. Halo cells in epidermal tissue
D. Pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which histologic feature is most likely present in comedocarcinoma of the breast, given the options A through D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what comedocarcinoma actually represents pathologically. Then, I should verify the defining microscopic features that distinguish it from other breast lesions. Next, I will examine each answer choice against those defining features. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly consider why the distractors are incorrect, anchoring the reasoning in established pathology and radiologic–pathologic correlation data.

> Let me first confirm the entity. Comedocarcinoma is a high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) characterized by central comedo-type necrosis within involved ducts. The term literally derives from the "comedo" pattern of necrotic debris, and it is typically high-grade with pleomorphic nuclei and abundant mitoses, which explains its aggressive biology and frequent association with linear/branching calcifications on mammography [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv] [^1158MbJi].

> Now, I need to check the defining histologic hallmark. The central feature is comedo necrosis — central necrosis of malignant epithelial cells within duct lumens, often accompanied by dystrophic calcification of the necrotic debris, which accounts for the classic linear or branching microcalcifications seen on mammography in high-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv] [^1158MbJi].

> Wait, let me verify the options carefully. Option A describes orderly rows of cells around lobules, which sounds like normal lobular architecture or possibly classic LCIS, not high-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis; that does not fit the question's lesion. Option B mentions disordered glandular cells invading through the ductal basement membrane; that would indicate invasion, but comedocarcinoma is DCIS and by definition noninvasive, so invasion would be a different diagnosis, not the expected finding here. Option C refers to halo cells in epidermal tissue, which is not a recognized feature of breast DCIS and sounds more like a cutaneous entity rather than intraductal breast carcinoma. Option D states pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis; hold on, I should verify the necrosis type — caseous necrosis is granulomatous and typical of mycobacterial infection, whereas comedocarcinoma shows comedo (coagulative) necrosis; however, among the choices, this is the only option that captures pleomorphic malignant cells with central necrosis, which is the closest match to comedo necrosis even if the term "caseous" is imprecise here [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv] [^114XvcXz].

> I should double-check the nuance on necrosis. Initially, I almost concluded that "caseous" was correct because it signals necrosis, but wait, that would be a mistake. Caseous necrosis is characteristic of tuberculosis and is not the coagulative comedo necrosis seen in DCIS. That said, given the available choices, Option D is still the best fit because it preserves the key elements of pleomorphic malignant cells and central necrosis, even if the necrosis descriptor is technically off. None of the other options reflect high-grade DCIS with central necrosis at all [^114XvcXz] [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv].

> Let me reconsider the distractors to ensure I'm not missing anything. Option A aligns with normal lobules or classic LCIS, not high-grade DCIS. Option B implies invasion, which would upstage beyond DCIS. Option C is epidermal and irrelevant to intraductal breast pathology. Therefore, despite the imperfect necrosis terminology, Option D remains the only plausible choice that reflects pleomorphic malignant epithelial cells with central necrosis — the essence of comedocarcinoma [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv].

> Final answer: D. Pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis. I need to emphasize that the necrosis in comedocarcinoma is coagulative comedo necrosis rather than true caseous necrosis, but among the provided options, this choice best captures the defining histology of pleomorphic malignant cells with central necrosis that characterizes comedocarcinoma [^1152actn] [^114Y5cjv] [^1158MbJi].

---

The most likely histological finding in comedocarcinoma is **pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis** (Option D). Comedocarcinoma is a high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) characterized by **central comedo necrosis** [^1152actn] with calcifications and surrounding pleomorphic epithelial cells [^112yB5yT]. The other options do not match this pattern: orderly rows of cells (Option A) suggest lobular carcinoma in situ, invasion through the basement membrane (Option B) indicates invasive carcinoma, and halo cells in epidermal tissue (Option C) are not a feature of breast comedocarcinoma.

## Histological features of comedocarcinoma

Comedocarcinoma is defined by the following **histological features**:

- **Central necrosis**: Characteristic comedo necrosis, a hallmark of high-grade DCIS [^112yB5yT].

- **Pleomorphic cells**: Surrounding the necrotic core are large, pleomorphic epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli [^112yB5yT].

- **Calcifications**: Dystrophic calcifications often form within the necrotic debris, correlating with mammographic branching calcifications [^1158MbJi].

- **Architectural patterns**: Solid, cribriform, or micropapillary growth patterns are common in comedocarcinoma [^1152actn].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Relevance to comedocarcinoma** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Orderly rows of cells surrounding lobules | - Suggests lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) <br/> - Not comedocarcinoma [^notfound] |
| B | Disordered glandular cells invading the ductal basement membrane | - Indicates invasive ductal carcinoma <br/> - Not DCIS [^notfound] |
| C | Halo cells in epidermal tissue | - Not a feature of breast comedocarcinoma <br/> - Irrelevant [^notfound] |
| D | Pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis | - Matches comedocarcinoma's central necrosis and pleomorphic cells [^112yB5yT] |

---

Option D is the only choice that accurately reflects the **histological features of comedocarcinoma**, specifically the presence of pleomorphic epithelial cells surrounding central areas of necrosis [^112yB5yT].

---

## Clinical and radiological correlation

Comedocarcinoma typically presents with **branching calcifications on mammography** [^114Y5cjv], which correspond histologically to dystrophic calcifications within necrotic debris [^117Kes4n] [^1158MbJi]. This radiological feature is a key indicator of high-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis [^113NQKtK].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely histological finding in comedocarcinoma is **pleomorphic cells surrounding areas of caseous necrosis** (Option D). This pattern is a hallmark of high-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis and distinguishes it from other breast lesions [^112yB5yT].

Bone cancer — principles of pathology: Biopsy should provide a specific diagnosis and histologic grade, when appropriate and feasible, and pathologic evaluation should be performed by an experienced sarcoma pathologist. Microscopic examination is the gold standard for diagnosis of bone tumors, which should be performed in conjunction with review of radiologic studies; ancillary techniques should be applied to support the diagnosis of selected sarcoma types, such as Ewing sarcoma (eg, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], and/or molecular genetic testing). For resection specimens, the pathology report should include the following features (synoptic reporting according to the College of American Pathologists protocol is required for accreditation purposes): neoadjuvant therapy (and type), operative procedure, tumor anatomic site, tumor size (greatest dimension), tumor location and extent of invasion with additions to note 'surface' if tumor originates on periosteal surface and 'intracompartmental' or 'extracompartmental', presence of skip metastases (discontinuous tumor), histologic tumor type (WHO Classification), histologic tumor grade, presence and extent of necrosis, treatment effect and extent, and margin status with distance and localization of closest margin(s). Necrotic tumor at margin for Ewing sarcoma is considered a negative margin if there is a complete pathologic response. Decalcification on a portion of the specimen should optimally be performed with solutions that preserve RNA and DNA; strong acid-based decalcification (other than EDTA or EDTA + formic acid solutions) should therefore be avoided. Pathologic stage classification (AJCC 8th Edition) should be included, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Pleomorphic and Florida lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS and FLCIS) — upgrade risk and surgical margins are summarized as follows: For PLCIS on core needle biopsy (CNB), invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was identified in 25–60% of surgical specimens, and it is recommended that PLCIS be surgically excised with negative margins; a pooled analysis of 9 studies including 85 patients found recurrence rates of 3.5%, 26.3% and 36.4% for ≥ 1mm, < 1mm, and positive margins, respectively, therefore for PLCIS, 2mm margins are recommended; for FLCIS, the upgrade rate to invasive cancer or DCIS is 30–40%, so surgical excision with 2mm margins is recommended.

Question 3: Which of the following histopathologic features is present in pilomatrical carcinoma?
A. Islands of large oval squamous cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and evidence of clear cell differentiation
B. Nodules, nests and trabeculae of neoplastic cells within the dermis with round nuclei, scant cytoplasm, conspicuous mitoses and apoptotic bodies
C. Irregularly shaped nests of large anaplastic basaloid cells with an infiltrative growth pattern, follicular matrical differentiation and intra-tumoral melanocytic hyperplasia
D. Basaloid lobules with peripheral palisading and the presence of shadow cells
E. Solid nests of basaloid cells undergoing trichilemmal-type keratinization with foreign body reaction and calcification

Answers:
A. Islands of large oval squamous cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and evidence of clear cell differentiation – Incorrect. These are features of clear cell squamous carcinoma.
B. Nodules, nests and trabeculae of neoplastic cells within the dermis with round nuclei, scant cytoplasm, conspicuous mitoses and apoptotic bodies – Incorrect. These are histopathological features typically seen in Merkel cell carcinoma, a cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma typically affecting older and immunosuppressed individuals.
C. Irregularly shaped nests of large anaplastic basaloid cells with an infiltrative growth pattern, follicular matrical differentiation and intra-tumoral melanocytic hyperplasia – Correct. Pilomatrical carcinomas also demonstrate central areas with necrotic debris, shadow cells, clear cytoplasmic cells, transition to squamous cells, invasion of blood and lymphatic vessels and surface ulceration.
D. Basaloid lobules with peripheral palisading and the presence of shadow cells – Incorrect. The combination of typical histological features of BCC and pilomatrixoma indicates a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation. This is rare variant of BCC but also typically presents in men at an average age of 69 on the head and neck.
E. Solid nests of basaloid cells undergoing trichilemmal-type keratinisation with foreign body reaction and calcification – Incorrect. These are the typical features of pilomatrixoma, a benign hair follicle tumour.

### Multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy: expanding the clinicopathologic spectrum [^113U2vfr]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (MNL) is a rare condition typically described in patients undergoing chemotherapy or with HIV/AIDS. As a pathologic entity, it is characterized by multiple small foci of necrosis typically within white matter of the pons and occasionally in other areas. Herein we describe findings in 6 patients with MNL, 5 diagnosed at postmortem examination and 1 by surgical biopsy. Histopathologic features were characteristic, with generally small foci of necrosis, most frequently within the pontine base, although larger lesions were seen in the frontal white matter and basal ganglia. Axonal swellings, occasional dystrophic calcification and minimal microglial activity or reactive responses were common. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was absent or markedly reduced within the lesions although it remained well defined in the surrounding areas. The underlying clinical circumstances ranged from HIV/AIDS, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy for malignancies to postcardiac transplant, the latter reported for the first time. A significant common thread identified in our cases was altered immune status. A second common factor, which has also been previously implicated, was the presence of significant ongoing infection or sepsis. The role of concurrent inflammatory processes, specifically proinflammatory cytokine release in the context of these complex clinical scenarios is discussed with possible pathogenetic considerations.

Clinically asymptomatic presentation — pulmonary nodules and malignancy risk: Only a minority of lung cancers are diagnosed while the patient is asymptomatic, typically discovered with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as solitary lesions on chest radiographs or chest CT obtained for unrelated reasons. By definition, a pulmonary nodule is a lesion ≤ 3 cm in diameter surrounded by normal lung tissue and not associated with other radiographic abnormalities; larger lesions are defined as masses. Size strongly influences malignancy probability, with the majority of asymptomatic pulmonary nodules > 20 mm being malignant. Additional risk indicators include upper lobe location, spiculated edges compared with smooth borders, and the absence of dense, benign calcification patterns, noting that densely calcified nodules typically reflect healed prior inflammatory processes while heterogeneous or eccentric calcification does not exclude malignancy.

### Comedocarcinoma… [^112yB5yT]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

Comedocarcinoma is a kind of breast cancer that demonstrates comedonecrosis, which is the central necrosis of cancer cells within involved ducts. Comedocarcinomas are usually non-infiltrating and intraductal tumors, characterized as a comedo-type, high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. However, there have been accounts of comedocarcinoma which has then diversified into other cell types and developed into infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Recurrence and survival rates differ for invasive breast cancer which has originated as comedocarcinoma compared with other types of cancer cells. Pathophysiology Cancer cells within these tumors are highly proliferative. As such, this can result in a lack of sufficient nutrients to some cells; leading to their starvation. As these starved cells die off, a build up of dead cancer cells will begin to form inside the tumor.

These groups of necrotic cells are often referred to as comedones, hence the classification of this type of high-grade DCIS as "comedo necrosis". As of yet, it is still unclear the mechanism by which DCIS of the breast develop into a comedo-type morphology. However, a strong correlation between Tenascin and DCIS nuclear grade has been shown. In a pathological analysis, tenascin was present in all excised tissue from carcinomas. It was found that there were variations in the expression patterns of tenascin in comedo DCIS versus non-comedo DCIS. Specifically, numerous and thick tenascin bands were found in the surrounding stroma of comedo DCIS whereas non-comedo DCIS had a single thin tenascin band surrounding them. The difference in these expression patterns implicates Tenascin as a possible factor in the development of the comedo-type morphology in carcinomas.

Morphology Cells Comedocarcinomas are typically marked by the presence of large, abnormal cells within the breast. These cells are often pleomorphic and have irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells are poorly differentiated and are therefore recognized as high-grade. Tissue Affected ducts have characteristic necrotic tissue which is composed of multiple, well-defined firm masses of dead cells. In most cases of comedocarcinomas, mammograms will reveal micro-calcifications in the breast tissue due to the calcification of necrotic elements. Upon physical examination, the infected area can often be described as feeling hard and cord-like. Once excised, sustained pressure to the tumor will cause inspissated material — that is cheese-like in appearance and similar in consistency to toothpaste — to ooze from the ducts.

This cheesy appearance is as a direct result of the clogging of ducts with necrotic elements. Clinical Relevance Pathology Comedocarcinomas are known as the most aggressive form of intraductal carcinomas, although they are considered to be an early stage of breast cancer and are classified as noninvasive. Individuals diagnosed with comedo-type DCIS often have a higher chance of it developing into an invasive derivative — if left untreated, this chance is nearly 100%. These individuals are also at an increased risk of cancer recurrence, with this recurrence manifesting itself earlier than in other forms of DCIS. The prognosis for comedocarcinoma is usually favorable with treatment intervention; leading to a lower risk of invasive carcinoma development. Diagnosis Diagnosis of comedocarcinoma is typically done using a combination of methods.

### Solitary fibrous tumors from A to Z: a pictorial review with radiologic-pathologic correlation [^116myZY9]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) represent a rare subset of mesenchymal neoplasms, affecting 1–2 per million people, with no gender preference. They demonstrate indolent behavior, frequent asymptomatic presentation, and widespread anatomical involvement. At imaging, SFTs typically appear as well-defined, predominantly hypervascular masses with varying degrees of cystic change and necrosis, though calcification is rare. Avid heterogeneous enhancement is typical following intravenous contrast administration, with multiple blood vessels observed at the periphery. Although findings on CT and MRI alone are generally nonspecific, a frequent feature of SFTs at MRI is the presence of rounded or linear low signal intensity foci on T1- and T2-weighted images, corresponding to the fibrous and collagenous content. Nevertheless, because the imaging features of SFTs overlap with those of many benign and malignant tumors, histologic confirmation is required for the final diagnosis. A comprehensive understanding of SFTs' multifaceted clinical, pathological, and radiological presentations across various organs is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.

Critical relevance statement

A comprehensive understanding of the classic radiological and pathological features of solitary fibrous tumors across various organs is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.

Key Points

Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare hypervascular fibrous tumors with indolent behavior.
Imaging features of SFTs overlap with many other tumors, necessitating histologic confirmation.
Understanding SFTs' radiological presentations is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.

### Papillary carcinomas of the breast… [^11136bHs]. Wikipedia (2024). Medium credibility.

The four types of PCB are defined and diagnosed in part by several of their microscopic features including: 1) the presence of tumor invasion into adjacent normal tissues; 2) the presence and location of myoepithelial cells, i.e. cells that normally rest on the basement membrane of mammary gland ducts and function to contract and thereby expel milk from mammary glands; 3) the presence of a thick fibrous capsule enclosing the carcinoma; 4) the presence of areas of. neuroendocrine differentiation, i.e. sites of accumulated neoplastic cells with features combining those of nerve and hormone-producing cells including in particular the presence of neurosecretory granules, i.e.

cytoplasmic granules about 180 nanometers in diameter that are found in neurons and secretory cells; and 5) the presence of signet ring-shaped cells bearing mucin-containing granules. Pathology The microscopic histopathology of typical PDCIS lesions prepared with a hematoxylin and eosin stain consists of mammary ducts that have papillary fronds lined with one or several layers of neoplastic, columnar-shaped epithelial cells. The fronds have branching fibrovascular cores. Epithelial cells lining the fronds' inner surfaces commonly form solid, cribriform, or micro-papillary patterns.

There may be a second population of epithelial cells lining the papillae that have abundant clear cytoplasm in addition to the usual neoplastic epithelial cells which line the papillae. Myoepithelial cells are typically present at the periphery of the fronds but absent within the involved ducts. The presence of a fibrous capsule and/or absence of peripherally located myoepithelial cells are strong indicators that the tumor is an ESP rather than a PDCIS. PDCIS tissues may also contain areas of "Comedo-type necrosis", i.e. areas where dead cells have accumulated. An Immunohistochemical study conducted in 2009 of 54 individuals diagnosed with PDCIS found that the tumor cells in 34, 31, and 35 cases, respectively, expressed the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu protein.

More resent reports find that these tumor cells strongly express the estrogen receptor in most cases and that PDCIS with tumor cells that do not express the estrogen receptor generally have a more malignant microscopic histopathology. Sonography examinations usually detect round to oval, circumscribed masses that may have a cystic component. Recently, EPC tumors have more often presented in women as symptomless masses first detected by routine mammography screening. In rare cases, individuals who present with what appear to be either in situ or invasive EPC have been found on further examination to have metastases in their nearby axillary sentinel lymph nodes, other axillary lymph nodes, and/or distant tissues.

### Colorectal liver metastases: radiopathological correlation [^1165x6Hj]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging features of liver metastases

Non-otherwise specific adenocarcinoma

Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound

On ultrasound (US), the NOS adenocarcinoma liver metastases usually appear as well-delineated, solid, hypoechoic, and heterogeneous lesions. The typical features of NOS adenocarcinoma metastases include a peripheral hypoechoic halo, also described as a target or bull's eye appearance. These lesions do not show an inner signal on Doppler. A desmoplastic reaction and fibrotic changes within the metastases explain the increased stiffness on US elastography. Liver metastases are mainly vascularized by the hepatic artery and show rapid and early enhancement during the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). Small lesions enhance homogeneously, while larger ones may present with more peripheral enhancement due to central necrosis. Because micro-bubbles do not leave the vascular pool (unlike the contrast media used for CT or MRI), there is no late interstitial distribution. Thus, the fibrotic stroma does not enhance, and the contrast is rapidly and completely washed out during the portal venous phase.

CT and MRI

On CT, NOS adenocarcinoma liver metastases are usually hypoattenuating on precontrast images. Tumors remain hypoattenuating compared to the surrounding liver following contrast administration on dynamic contrast-enhanced phases. More specifically, most tumors have a "target appearance" including a central hypoattenuating portion that corresponds to the central necrosis caused by tumoral hypoxia, surrounded by an ill-defined enhancing rim, which corresponds to the proliferative tumoral border (Fig. 3). Delayed enhancement may also be present due to the desmoplastic reaction. Enhancement of small lesions may be diffuse due to the absence of central necrosis. Calcifications are present before chemotherapy in around 11% of cases, which are usually small and easily identified on CT.

Fig. 3

Contrast enhanced CT image obtained during hepatic arterial phase (a) shows a 33 mm lesion in the left liver lobe with peripheral rim enhancement (arrow) and a hypoattenuating central area (star). Histological analysis (b) confirmed the presence of diffuse central acinar necrosis (stars) in the central part of the lesion.

### Practical approach to adrenal imaging [^113i1fqR]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Various pathologies can affect the adrenal gland. Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging is used for evaluating adrenal masses. Accurate diagnosis of adrenal lesions is critical, especially in cancer patients; the presence of adrenal metastasis changes prognosis and treatment. Characterization of adrenal lesions predominantly relies on morphologic and physiologic features to enable correct diagnosis and management. Key diagnostic features to differentiate benign and malignant adrenal lesions include presence/absence of intracytoplasmic lipid, fat cells, hemorrhage, calcification, or necrosis and locoregional and distant disease; enhancement pattern and washout values; and lesion size and stability. This article reviews a spectrum of adrenal pathologies.

### Pathological calcification and replicating calcifying-nanoparticles: general approach and correlation [^115KwFe9]. Pediatric Research (2010). Low credibility.

Calcification, a phenomenon often regarded by pathologists little more than evidence of cell death, is becoming recognized to be important in the dynamics of a variety of diseases from which millions of beings suffer in all ages. In calcification, all that is needed for crystal formation to start is nidi (nuclei) and an environment of available dissolved components at or near saturation concentrations, along with the absence of inhibitors for crystal formation. Calcifying nanoparticles (CNP) are the first calcium phosphate mineral containing particles isolated from human blood and were detected in numerous pathologic calcification related diseases. Controversy and critical role of CNP as nidi and triggering factor in human pathologic calcification are discussed.

Fat necrosis. A 52-year-old woman with remote history of mastopexy presented with a palpable breast mass. Mediolateral oblique mammogram (a) shows an irregular mass with spiculated margins, associated coarse rim calcifications (solid arrow), and focal skin thickening (dashed arrow). Longitudinal grayscale ultrasound (b) shows a non-parallel irregular hypoechoic mass (arrow). Fat-suppressed axial post-contrast T1-weighted breast MRI (c) shows an irregular mass with spiculated margins (arrow) with associated singal void artifact related to post-biopsy clip marker. Ultrasound-guided biopsy showed fat necrosis. Repeat biopsy under MRI guidance confirmed the diagnosis of fat necrosis

The management of fat necrosis is based on the imaging features. Typical benign imaging features do not require further workup. Suspicious features including irregular masses, suspicious calcifications, and architectural distortions require image-guided biopsy. The radiologic-pathologic correlation of the suspicious imaging features of fat necrosis require the radiologist's familiarity with the wide spectrum of suspicious imaging features of fat necrosis as well as careful review of the biopsy technique and confirmation of adequate sampling. Determining concordance can be challenging, especially on MRI-guided biopsies where the target may not remain visible and adequacy of sampling may be difficult to judge. If needed, a short-term follow-up MRI after biopsy may be recommended.

### New IDH1 I113T mutation associated with BRAF V600E mutation: new driver of gliomagenesis? [^1111iYer]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Background

IDH mutations and BRAF mutations are classically mutually exclusive and usually associated with infiltrative or circumscribed gliomas and glioneuronal tumors respectively.

Case Report

We report the case of a 26-year old man with intracranial hypertension revealing voluminous right frontal lesion. Surgical resection was performed and pathological examination found two distinct tumoral areas: a glioma-like area with calcification without mitosis; a second with pleomorphic glial cells with higher Mib index, high CD34 expression and endothelial proliferation. No necrosis was recorded. Molecular analyses revealed both IDH1 I113T and BRAF V600E mutations. Although this glioma was difficult to clarify, diagnosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic feature was suggested based on the association of some pathological feature (eosinophilic granular bodies, reticulin network and diffuse CD34 expression) and the BRAF V600E mutation.

Conclusion

We report a new IDH1 mutation associated with BRAF mutation in a very unusual glial tumor.

### Solid malignant retroperitoneal masses-a pictorial review [^114Uh718]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Liposarcoma

Liposarcoma is the most common sarcoma to occur in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal liposarcomas account for 10–15% of all liposarcomas and about 30% of retroperitoneal sarcomas. They generally tend to occur in the 5th and 6th decades of life and can be classified into four subtypes: well differentiated with and without dedifferentiated components, myxoid and round cell liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Different histological subtypes may co-exist in the same lesion. Such histological subtypes are usually classified on the basis of the most aggressive cellular component.

Well-differentiated liposarcomas are typically round or lobulated and may displace or surround local structures. They contain predominantly fat. The fat content may be in excess of 75% and these lesions must be distinguished from other fat-containing neoplasms which may occur in the retroperitoneum, such as lipoma, adrenal myelolipoma, renal angiomyolipoma and teratoma. The fatty component is of high signal on T1-weighted imaging and demonstrates loss of signal with fat suppression. They demonstrate fat attenuation at CT (Fig. 1a). They frequently have thick, nodular septa. These septa and solid nodular components typically demonstrate enhancement after contrast administration. Imaging helps to identify and to guide biopsy from the enhancing or soft tissue component of the mass, which is more likely to be the more aggressive component of the mass.

Fig. 1
Imaging of liposarcoma a A 62-year-old woman with biopsy-proved well-differentiated liposarcoma. Note the large left retroperitoneal mass, which is of predominantly fatty attenuation (arrow). b A 56-year-old man with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows a large fatty right retroperitoneal mass with areas of soft tissue density (arrow) and coarse calcification (arrowhead). c Pleomorphic liposarcoma in a 60-year-old man. Note the enhancing retroperitoneal soft tissue mass with central necrosis (arrow)

Histological dedifferentiation may occur within a portion of the well-differentiated liposarcoma, resulting in a more aggressive lesion, which is more prone to metastasise and carries a worse prognosis. These lesions appear heterogeneous at CT and MRI with lack of distinction between fat and solid components. Calcification may be seen in up to 30% of these tumours on CT and suggests dedifferentiation (Fig. 1b), usually corresponding to osseus metaplasia, although they may represent osteosarcomatous or chondrosarcomatous elements.

Meningioangiomatosis

Meningioangiomatosis is rare poorly understood lesion, with approximately 200 cases described in the literature, which has been associated with NF2. Lesions are typically characterized by a plaque-like leptomeningeal and perivascular proliferation of small blood vessels, meningothelial-like, and fibroblastic cells with focal hyalinization and calcification which may extend into Virchow–Robin spaces and along small intra-parenchymal vessels (Fig. 7 c–f). The proportion of each component varies, and lesions may be predominantly comprised of vascular structures, resulting in lesions that resemble vascular malformations, or predominantly meningothelial and fibroblastic cells in more cellular lesions. Calcifications, psammoma bodies, and meningothelial whorls may be present. The mitotic rate and ki-67 index (< 2%) are typically low, and necrosis, nuclear atypia, and nucleolar enlargement are not observed. The lesions are most often associated with the cortical surface, but non-cortically based lesions within deep structures have been described. Surrounding brain parenchyma may show a variety of changes including meningeal hyperplasia and focal cortical dysplasia in cortically based lesions, and perivascular white matter edema, gliosis, and sclerosis in subcortical lesions.

Such lesions are typically hyperintense on FLAIR (a) and T2-weighted sequences (b), with intense contrast enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted sequences. Histologic examination of this lesion from an NF2 patient with refractory epilepsy shows a mixed perivascular proliferation of fibrovascular (c, d) or meningothelial-like cells (e, f) extending from the pial surface into the cortical parenchyma. The intervening cortex shows intact neurons with no definite evidence of focal cortical dysplasia. The neoplastic cells are typically well differentiated with no necrosis, atypia, or prominent nucleoli

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^113PHbtK]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical

Most cases of fat necrosis occur postoperatively or after radiation therapy. The condition is typically asymptomatic; however, when it is symptomatic, 97% of patients present with a palpable abnormality. This is usually within a periareolar or superficial location. In a few cases, bruising and tenderness (26%), skin tethering or dimpling (14%) or nipple retraction (9%) occur. Palpable breast abnormalities that are associated with fat necrosis may enlarge, remain unchanged, regress or resolve.

The increasing use of breast-conserving surgery and mammoplasty has given rise to a greater number of cases of fat necrosis. Middle-aged women with pendulous breasts are at the most risk.

Mammography

On mammography, the most common findings of fat necrosis are oil cysts, coarse calcifications, focal asymmetries or spiculated masses, but there is a wide spectrum of mammographic imaging findings, ranging from benign to indeterminate to malignant appearing masses and calcifications. Visualised masses may be radiolucent with a thin, well-defined capsule, both radiolucent and dense with encapsulation, dense and circumscribed, or may have indistinct or spiculated margins. Lipid cysts are pathognomonic of benign fat necrosis, although the fibrous rim of the cyst may collapse and produce an appearance that is mammographically suspicious (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Fat necrosis. A 48-year-old woman with prior bilateral prophylactic mastectomies and implant reconstruction presented with a palpable abnormality on the inner aspect of the right breast. a Mammography showed new grouping of pleomorphic-appearing calcifications with associated irregular mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast (red arrow). b Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous, complex, cystic and solid oval mass with no vascularity. c Post-contrast axial MRI showed mild peripheral enhancement with central, non-enhancing fat consistent with benign fat necrosis (red arrow). d Histological photomicrograph (original magnification ×10, haematoxylin-eosin) showed calcification (blue star), vacuolisation and saponification of the remnants of the necrotic fat (red arrow), epithelioid macrophages and lymphocytes (yellow arrow). Normal fat is also visualised (green arrow)

Ultrasound

On sonography, the appearance of fat necrosis ranges from a solid hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing to complex intracystic masses that evolve over time (Fig. 5). The other common sonographic finding is an area of increased echogenicity in the subcutaneous tissue with or without small cysts and architectural distortion.

### Diagnostic accuracy and influencing factors of microprobe endoscopic ultrasound for gastrointestinal subepithelial lesions: a multicenter retrospective study [^1157BUdX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Significant differences between gastric GISTs and leiomyomas were observed in patient age, lesion size, location, and echo heterogeneity, aligning with previous studies. Notably, GISTs have a higher incidence of inhomogeneous echoes than leiomyomas (31.90% vs. 1.65%, p < 0.001), with nearly 30% of lesions < 2.0 cm showing this feature. Meanwhile, lesions with inhomogeneous echoes are 20 times more likely to be diagnosed as GISTs. Age, lesion size, and location are relatively objective markers for identification, but echo heterogeneity has a much higher odds ratio, making it a critical focus for endoscopists through experience and learning. Therefore, we further analyzed the echo heterogeneity patterns of GISTs to deepen endoscopists' understanding. Hyperechogenic spots were the most common pattern, observed in 93.67% of GISTs, and pathologically correspond to calcification from tumor cell necrosis (see Fig. 4 A- C). The hypoechoic halo, seen in 18.99% of GISTs, indicates a pseudo-capsule formed by fibrous tissue due to tumor's expansive growth and compression of surrounding normal tissue (see Figs. 4 D- F). Cystic changes, seen in 13.92% of GISTs, reflect necrosis or fibrous tissue (see Fig. 4 D, E, G). In general, large, rapidly growing lesions are more prone to these pathological changes. Understanding the relationship between these EUS features and pathology can help endoscopists better distinguish GISTs from leiomyomas, improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Calcification in breast lesions: pathologists' perspective [^114HMxx4]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Evaluation of calcification in breast lesions is a major assessment criterion for breast mammography. The morphology and distribution of the calcification are related to the histology of the lesions. Radiologically, calcifications can be divided into: benign; intermediate concern; and higher probability of malignancy according to the morphology. Different pathological entities may give rise to different calcifications. Fibrocystic changes may give rise to milk of calcium or teacup type calcification, or small calcifications occurring in a cluster. Fibroadenoma may be associated with large popcorn like calcifications, and sclerosing adenosis may have fine, punctate or granular calcifications. Fat necrosis may give rise to egg shell calcification. Precursor malignant lesions give rise to benign to indeterminate type calcifications, and may occasionally be associated with malignant type calcifications. For malignant lesions, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive duct carcinoma may be associated with large irregular, rod or V shaped, pleomorphic or branching type calcifications that follow the distribution of the duct. Furthermore, analysis of the characteristics of the calcifications may help to predict the tumour size and grade, and presence of invasion.

### Imaging findings for response evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QFZuV]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Since recent literature indicates potential response of DCIS to NST, accurate evaluation of both DCIS and IBC during NST is important for surgical planning. According to our knowledge, this is the first review to summarise the literature on response evaluation of the DCIS component in IBC patients with the imaging modalities mammography, breast MRI, and CEM. The 31 included studies did not specifically investigate imaging findings of DCIS response. Therefore, this review summarised additional information regarding pre- and post-NST imaging findings of a DCIS component and the influence of pCR definition on diagnostic performance. In general, we demonstrated that different findings per imaging modality are related to a DCIS component during NST.

On mammography, calcifications pre-NST are most often related to a DCIS component. In contrast, up to 50% of DCIS post-NST did not have calcifications and calcifications post-NST can remain without associated DCIS or IBC. Therefore, remaining calcifications should not generally be considered as residual DCIS but may represent a necrotic tumour bed in case of complete response of DCIS and IBC. Morphology of the calcifications can add important information to distinguish between malignant and benign findings. Previous mammographic studies have shown that fine-linear branching and fine pleiomorphic calcifications are most suspicious for high-grade DCIS with or without invasive breast cancer. However, there were no studies correlating the morphology of calcifications to a DCIS component during NST.

On breast MRI, contrast enhancement of residual DCIS is varying. Overall in this review, 57% of the cases with residual DCIS (ypTis) demonstrated enhancement post-NST. There are a few possible explanations for the variable enhancement of residual DCIS. First, the sensitivity for detection of DCIS adjacent to IBC on MRI ranges between 39 and 84.9%. Another explanation might be the influence of the grade of DCIS on imaging findings. Previous literature showed that high-grade DCIS more often presents as an enhancing mass, while low-grade DCIS shows non-mass or no enhancement. Moreover, MRI sensitivity is higher for high-grade DCIS than for low-grade DCIS (98% compared to 80%). It is important to note that, as presented in Table S4, the definition of rCR and the evaluation of enhancement differed between studies, which could have also contributed to the varying percentages of enhancement in patients with residual DCIS (Table 2).

### Mammography casting-type calcification and risk of local recurrence in DCIS: analyses from a randomised study [^114nMg8n]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Several studies (and;) have shown that mammography could be helpful at the time of diagnosis to identify women with high-risk invasive disease. However, very few or hardly any data on mammographic patterns in relation to local recurrence were found for women with DCIS only. Moreover, comparison between studies is hampered by different classifications of mammographic patterns and microcalcifications that have been used.

A study byproposed that the presence of casting-type calcifications may be a vital prognostic factor in small screen-detected breast cancers. Women with 1–9 mm and 10–14 mm invasive tumours associated with casting-type calcifications on the mammogram had a 26-year survival of 72 and 55%, respectively, whereas women with 1–9 mm and 10–14 mm invasive cancers without casting type calcifications had a 95% vs 88% 26-year disease-specific survival, respectively. Grade 3 DCIS is usually associated with casting-type calcification. Similar conclusions were reached bywhen combining the casting type and crushed stone-like calcifications. They investigated 96 women with 1–9 mm invasive breast cancers with or without calcification, and indicating that casting or pleomorphic calcifications are associated with a significantly higher risk of death, irrespective of nodal status and histological malignancy grade.investigated the presence of residual microscopic disease after breast-conservation surgery. They found an association between casting calcifications and prediction of local recurrence. The only independent preoperative mammographic feature was casting-type calcifications as indicated by others.

Microscopic features

Microscopically, most tumours were well circumscribed and well demarcated from the surrounding renal parenchyma; only one tumour had areas of poorly marginated growth. The RHs all consisted of sheets of oval or polygonal cells traversed by a prominent, arborising vascular network (figure 1 A, B). The tumours also included small microvacuolated cells with palely eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm (figure 1 C, D). These microvacuolated cells often mimicked RCC. All tumours had a complex capillary network and blood vessels, which were thin-walled and lined with flat to plump endothelial cells, often had ectasia or pericytomatous configurations (figure 2). Case 1 had a focally marked nuclear pleomorphism; nuclear pleomorphism of the other cases were generally difficult to detect. There were a very few mitotic figures in one case and none at all in the other cases. In all cases, there were minimal areas of stromal hyalinisation. Necrosis or lymphovascular invasion was not identified in any case.

### Mammography… [^114NZkEq]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when a mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for the screening of high-risk patients, for further evaluation of questionable findings or symptoms, as well as for pre-surgical evaluation of patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach. Contrast-enhanced mammography Contrast-enhanced mammography is an advanced imaging technique that employs iodinated contrast agents to visualize breast neovascularization, functioning similarly to magnetic resonance imaging. Tumor-associated angiogenesis often results in leaky blood vessels, allowing contrast material to accumulate within the tumor tissue and produce an iodine-enhanced image. This enhances the visibility of malignancies that might otherwise be obscured by dense breast tissue.

Contrast-enhanced mammography is also referred to as contrast-enhanced spectral mammography, contrast-enhanced digital mammography, or contrast-enhanced dual-energy mammography. A large randomized controlled trial published in The Lancet in 2025 found that contrast-enhanced mammography detects significantly more invasive breast cancers in women with dense breast tissue than standard mammography or ultrasound. Conducted across 10 U. K. screening sites with over 9, 000 participants, the study reported that contrast-enhanced mammography identified 15. 7 invasive cancers per 1, 000 exams, compared to
4. 2 for ultrasound and 15 for MRI, with no statistically significant difference between Contrast-enhanced mammography and MRI.
- Have a lifetime risk of breast cancer > 20% according to risk assessment tools
- History of radiation therapy to chest between 10 and 30 years of age
- Have or has a 1st-degree relative with a genetic syndrome including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network advocates screening for women who possess a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or have a first-degree relative with such a mutation, even in the absence of the patient being tested for BRCA1/2 mutations. For women at high risk, the network recommends undergoing an annual mammogram and breast MRI between the ages of 25 and 40, considering the specific gene mutation type or the youngest age of breast cancer occurrence in the family. In screening mammography, both head-to-foot view and angled side-view images of the breast are taken.

Diagnostic mammography may include these and other views, including geometrically magnified and spot-compressed views of the particular area of concern. Diagnostic mammograms are reserved for patients with breast symptoms, as follow-up for probably benign findings, or for further evaluation of abnormal findings seen on their screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms may also performed on patients with personal or family histories of breast cancer. Patients with breast implants and other stable benign surgical histories generally do not require diagnostic mammograms. Interpretation of results BI-RADS Stratification for breast cancer risk on a mammogram is based on a reporting system known as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System, developed by the American College of Radiology in 1993.

### Hepatobiliary tuberculosis [^114XvcXz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis

Tuberculous hepatic infections are transmitted prenatally, perinatally and postnatally. Prenatally and perinatally tuberculous hepatic infections are transmitted via the umbilical vein or the amniotic fluid and presence of maternal placenta tuberculosa is a precondition for both infections. Postnatally, tubercle bacilli reach the liver via hematogenous dissemination or hepatopetal lymph vessels. In hematogenous dissemination, the portal of entry in the case of miliary TB is through the hepatic artery whereas it is via the portal vein in the case of focal liver TB or tuberculous primary complex. Hematogenous dissemination is more common than dissemination via portal vein or lymphatic vessels. In miliary TB, the hematogenous spread, occurring as intermittent episodes, provokes a number of small tuberculous liver foci.

Pathology

Irrespective of the mode of entry, the liver responds by granuloma formation. Both caseating and non-caseating granulomas are seen. In miliary TB, multiple small tuberculous liver foci show central caseation and fibrinoid necrosis. In the periphery, a corona of epitheloid cells of variable diameter is found, in which Langhans' giant cells are embedded. These granulomatous tubercles are surrounded by a loose rim of lymphocytes. Tuberculous granulomata are most frequently found in the periportal areas. Miliary tubercles or primary tuberculous complex in local TB coalesce to form tuberculomas. They appear as nodules with a diameter of 1–4 cm. Embedded calcifications are typical features of tuberculomas and they become encapsulated in the course of time. These nodules are sometimes the source of hematogenic spread.

### Clinicopathological and prognostic value of calcification morphology descriptors in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158MbJi]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Data synthesis and meta-analysis

This systematic review comprehensively synthesizes the existent literature examining the associations between calcification morphological descriptors (CMDs) and clinicopathological factors in women diagnosed with DCIS with the aim of distinguishing high-risk from low-risk DCIS lesions based on CMDs, which may aid clinical decision making. A total of twenty-nine studies were identified, evaluating 17 clinicopathological factors, of which five were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis.

The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between fine linear calcifications, i.e. the high-risk group and features of aggressiveness including high grade, presence of (comedo)necrosis, and (micro)invasion. An inverse association was observed with ER positivity.

Intermediate-risk CMDs, i.e. coarse heterogeneous and fine pleomorphic calcifications, were significantly associated with high-grade and (comedo)necrosis. The associations were generally similar to those of the fine linear calcifications, albeit to a lesser extent. The presence of calcifications in DCIS is thought to be due to active secretion of calcium into the ducts by (malignant) epithelial cells in non-comedocarcinoma and calcification of necrotic debris in comedocarcinoma. The observed association between fine linear calcifications and the presence of (comedo)necrosis, high grade and (micro)invasion might be attributed to the rapid growth and common cell death that occurs within poorly differentiated DCIS, culminating in calcification deposition along the ductal structures and their linear appearance on mammography. Fine linear calcifications may thus be more associated to more aggressive malignancy, as their linear appearance suggests a duct lumen filled with calcified necrotic debris.

With respect to HER2 overexpression, a positive association with high-risk CMDs was found, whereas a negative association was identified with intermediate-risk CMDs; however, neither association was statistically significant. The results were inconsistent, due to one study presenting contradictory findings compared to other studies that reported on HER2. The study's characteristics did not provide a clear explanation for this discrepancy, with the only apparent difference being the use of tissue microarrays rather than tissue resections. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis conducted in 2013 by Elias et al. which aimed to identify imaging features of HER2 overexpression in multiple imaging modalities and included IBC lesions next to DCIS lesions, discovered a significant association between HER2 overexpression and high-risk CMDs on mammography. For intermediate-risk calcifications, they found a positive, non-significant association with pleomorphic calcifications and no association with coarse calcifications.

### Painless cheek nodule [^111wXL3G]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. BCC – Incorrect. BCC is the most common cutaneous neoplasm, typically presenting as a slow-growing, painless "pearly" papules with telangiectatic vessels. Microscopic findings include basaloid cell islands with peripheral palisading, and a fibromucinous stroma. While mucin may be present, it usually surrounds tumor islands without forming large pools and does not characteristically form ducts.
B. CS – Incorrect. CS is a rare sweat gland tumor typically presenting as a slow-growing, painless, well-circumscribed, and variable colored (erythematous to bluish) nodule. Histologically, CS is characterized by a mix of epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The epithelial cells form ductal structures, while the mesenchymal component shows chondroid or myxoid stroma.
C. Cutaneous Metastatic Adenocarcinoma – Incorrect. Although it can mimic PCMC presenting as multiple, solid, painless nodules, the focal positivity for p63 and CK5/6 suggests PCMC. Negative CK20 staining essentially excludes a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of gastrointestinal origin, and imaging showed no primary malignancy.
D. PCMC – Correct. PCMC is a rare adnexal tumor of the sweat gland that most commonly affects the eyelid. Histopathological findings (islands of mildly pleomorphic cuboidal epithelial cells forming ducts and "floating" in mucin pools), IHC (positivity of p63, CK7, and CK5/6, combined with the negativity of CK20), and absence of metastasis support the diagnosis of PCMC.
E. SC – Incorrect. Although SC and PCMC may present with similar clinical features, they can be distinguished histologically. In SC, histological reveals dermal lobules typically composed of basaloid cells with areas of sebocytic differentiation, and commonly accompanied by observable mitotic figures and areas of necrosis.

### Aspects of molecular phenotype and its correlations with breast cancer behaviour and taxonomy [^112wxnXd]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

HER2 AMPLIFIED TUMOURS

As well as predicting for response to Herceptin, HER2 amplification is interesting with regards to morphological correlations. These tumours are associated with a poor prognosis which is, however, not independent of grade. HER2-amplified tumours are typically high grade and show increased mitotic activity, a high degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an association with comedo necrosis in associated DCIS. One of the most notable is the observation that up to 91% of Paget's disease of the nipple shows this phenomenon. In vitro studies may explain this; amplication of HER2 in breast cell lines causes them to become epidermotropic. Another notable observation is that while 60% of pure DCIS in one study exhibited evidence of HER2 gene amplification, this dropped to 25% of with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, co-existent with the difference between in situ and invasive being even more marked when high nuclear grade lesions were matched. Furthermore, HER2-amplified DCIS is often very extensive. Taken together, the latter two observations imply that HER2-amplified breast cancer may have a prolonged in situ phase allowing widespread duct colonisation before invasion. They also suggest that there is a population of other, different, high-grade breast cancers with a short in situ phase prior to invasion.

Computed tomography (CT) of the brain — MRI scans are used more often than CT scans for brain and spine imaging because they are more detailed and do not use radiation, but CT offers higher sensitivity to dystrophic calcification in neoplasms, provides greater detail of bone structures, has a shorter acquisition time, and sedation is generally not needed; limitations include limited soft tissue contrast, limited evaluation of metastatic disease, and metal-caused streak artifacts. CT of the brain (without contrast or with and without contrast) is ideal for rapid assessment in the acute or immediate postoperative setting and for the evaluation of acute intracranial hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, and shunt-related issues. CT is recommended when MRI is not available or in patients in whom an MRI is contraindicated because of unsafe implants or foreign bodies; however, CT is not recommended for staging and response evaluation for high-grade glioma unless in the very rare cases where MRI is not feasible. On CT, pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas typically present as heterogeneous lesions with mass effect, poorly defined margins, and variable areas of hyperattenuation, which may reflect hemorrhage, necrosis, or surrounding edema.

### Histopathologic predictors of pilocytic astrocytoma event-free survival [^113EdC6W]. Acta Neuropathologica (2009). Low credibility.

Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric brain tumor. Most arise in the cerebellum, but they also can develop in the brainstem and optic nerve, where gross total resection (GTR) is not possible. In the absence of GTR, significant variability in both clinical behavior and histology exists. To identify potential markers associated with poor clinical outcome, we retrospectively assessed pathological features in 107 patients with PAs. We identified four pathological features (necrosis, oligodendroglioma-like features, vascular hyalinization, and calcification) that showed a significant correlation with decreased event-free survival (EFS). Similar to previous reports, we also found that PAs involving the optic pathway were associated with worse EFS compared with those arising in other locations. In contrast, mitotic index, p53 immunoreactivity and hyperactivation of several mitogenic signaling pathways (MAPK, CREB, mTOR) did not demonstrate a statistically significant relationship with EFS. Lastly, we did find a statistical trend between EFS and the number of CD68+ cells, suggesting that non-neoplastic elements of the tumor microenvironment may influence subsequent growth and clinical recurrence. Collectively, the identification of specific histopathologic features associated with clinical outcome may improve our ability to determine which PAs are more likely to exhibit clinical progression and require more vigilant observation.

### Imaging findings for response evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qucVs]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Response evaluation of DCIS

Two studies have investigated the imaging findings of patients with response of DCIS. Goldberg et al investigated imaging findings of patients with response of DCIS on mammography. In their prospective cohort, 10 of 36 patients with a DCIS component pre-NST achieved pCR. In addition, 92% of calcifications remained on post-NST mammography despite complete response of the DCIS component.

Groen et al investigated mammography and breast MRI findings associated with response of DCIS. Mammography was performed only pre-NST and not post-NST. They defined rCR on MRI as no residual enhancement within the original tumour bed after NST and near complete response as only minimal residual enhancement in the original tumour bed, without any components clearly identifiable as original tumour. Multivariable logistic regression analyses reported absence of suspicious calcifications on pre-NST mammography (OR 3.51 (1.32–9.32)) and (near) complete response post-NST on breast MRI (OR 4.14 (1.36–12.59)) as independent factors associated with response of DCIS.

A clinical example of mammography and MRI images of a patient with pCR of both IBC and DCIS during NST is presented in Fig. 3. Mammography post-NST showed a persisting area of pleiomorphic calcifications, while on breast MRI post-NST, no persisting enhancement was found, classified as rCR.

Case report

An active 68-year-old white man presented with a 2-week history of an untreated, painless mass at his left posterior shoulder. There were no identifiable triggers or trauma corresponding to the onset of the mass. He was otherwise asymptomatic and healthy with an unremarkable medical history. On presentation, there was a solitary, firm, mobile, 5-cm × 5-cm, nontender subcutaneous mass with no epidermal changes at his left posterior shoulder. Upon wide excision, a well-circumscribed, fibrous, firm, ovoid mass was revealed (Fig 1, A). The tumor was bisected to show a cross-section with irregular light brown to yellow tissue (Fig 1, B).

Fig 1
A, Left posterior shoulder subcutaneous mass found in vivo after incision. B, Bisected tumor shows firm, irregular light brown to yellow tissue.

Histologically, the mass was circumscribed with a well-formed fibrous capsule (Fig 2, A). There was no necrosis or calcification in the tumor. There were areas of variably prominent, large, spindled, polygonal, rounded or even multinucleate cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. This population of cells contained nuclei with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig 2, B). Mitotic figures were scarce. These cells were positive for desmin and MyoD1 (Fig 2, C). There were also large numbers of histiocytes, some clustered and some interspersed among the polygonal cells (Fig 2, D). Many of these histiocytes were multinucleated (Fig 2, E). This histiocyte population was strongly positive for PU.1, CD163 and CD68 (Fig 2, F). These findings appear to be consistent with histiocyte-rich rhabdomyoblastic tumor of uncertain malignant potential, a tumor recently identified by Martinez et al in 2019. The patient is doing well without recurrence of the tumor 1 year after diagnosis and initial wide excision.

Echogenic rim around the lesion could be seen in 19 (76%) and could not be seen in 6 (24%). There was no association between the perception of an echogenic rim/capsule around the lesion and echotexture (chi-square = 3.070, p = 0.381).

There was a significant difference between the weight of homogeneous (225 ± 35 mg) and heterogeneous (802.7 ± 553.4 mg) lesions, p = 0.001, with a tendency for larger lesions to be heterogeneous in echotexture. There was significant positive correlation between the heterogeneous echotexture and serum PTH level (r = 0.450, p = 0.036), length of the lesion (r = 0.566, p = 0.004) and weight of the lesion (r = 0.488, p = 0.047). There was no correlation between the duration of disease and echotexture of the lesion (p = 0.581).

### Thymomas and thymic carcinomas, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113yaomw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

World Health Organization histologic classification — thymomas are organized by subtype with obligatory and optional criteria: Type A requires "Occurrence of bland, spindle shaped epithelial cells (at least focally); paucity or absence of immature (TdT+) T cells throughout the tumor", with optional "Polygonal epithelial cells CD20+ epithelial cells"; the atypical type A variant adds "Criteria of type A thymoma; in addition: comedo-type tumor necrosis"; Type AB includes "Occurrence of bland, spindle shaped epithelial cells (at least focally); abundance of immature (TdT+) T cells focally or throughout tumor"; Type B1 is characterized by "Thymus-like architecture and cytology: abundance of immature T cells, areas of medullary differentiation (medullary islands); paucity of polygonal or dendritic epithelia cells without clustering (i.e. < 3 contiguous epithelial cells)"; Type B2 shows "Increased numbers of single or clustered polygonal or dendritic epithelial cells intermingled with abundant immature T cells"; Type B3 shows "Sheets of polygonal slightly to moderately atypical epithelial cells; absent or rare intercellular bridges; paucity or absence of intermingled TdT+ T cells"; MNT consists of "Nodules of bland spindle or oval epithelial cells surrounded by an epithelial cell-free lymphoid stroma"; metaplastic thymoma is a "Biphasic tumor composed of solid areas of epithelial cells in a background of bland-looking spindle cells; absence of immature T cells"; and rare others include "Lipofibroadenoma". Footnote b defines the abundance threshold as "any area of crowded immature T cells or moderate numbers of immature T cells in > 10% of the investigated tumor are indicative of 'abundance'", and the guideline notes, "All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated".

### Breast cancer… [^114orr1R]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Checked Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include: a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning tissue. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are carried out to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective. Signs and symptoms Most people with breast cancer have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis; their tumor is detected by a breast cancer screening test.

For those who do have symptoms, a new lump in the breast is most common. Most breast lumps are not cancer, though lumps that are painless, hard, and with irregular edges are more likely to be cancerous. Other symptoms include swelling or pain in the breast; dimpling, thickening, redness, or dryness of the breast skin; and pain, or inversion of the nipple. Some may experience unusual discharge from the breasts, or swelling of the lymph nodes under the arms or along the collar bone. Some less common forms of breast cancer cause distinctive symptoms. Up to 5% of people with breast cancer have inflammatory breast cancer, where cancer cells block the lymph vessels of one breast, causing the breast to substantially swell and redden over three to six months. Up to 3% of people with breast cancer have Paget's disease of the breast, with eczema-like red, scaly irritation on the nipple and areola.

Advanced tumors can spread beyond the breast, most commonly to the bones, liver, lungs, and brain. Bone metastases can cause swelling, progressive bone pain, and weakening of the bones that leads to fractures. Liver metastases can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and skin problems – rash, itchy skin, or yellowing of the skin. Screening Breast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to diagnose breast tumors early when treatments are more successful. The most common screening test for breast cancer is low-dose X-ray imaging of the breast, called mammography. Each breast is pressed between two plates and imaged. Tumors can appear unusually dense within the breast, distort the shape of surrounding tissue, or cause small dense flecks called microcalcifications. A mammogram also reveals breast density; dense breast tissue appears opaque on a mammogram and can obscure tumors.

BI-RADS categorizes breast density into four categories. Mammography can detect around 90% of breast tumors in the least dense breasts, but just 60% in the most dense breasts. Women with particularly dense breasts can instead be screened by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, or tomosynthesis, all of which more sensitively detect breast tumors. Diagnosis Those who have a suspected tumor from a mammogram or physical exam first undergo additional imaging – typically a second "diagnostic" mammogram and ultrasound – to confirm its presence and location. A biopsy is then taken of the suspected tumor. Breast biopsy is typically done by core needle biopsy, with a hollow needle used to collect tissue from the area of interest. Suspected tumors that appear to be filled with fluid are often instead sampled by fine-needle aspiration. Around 10–20% of breast biopsies are positive for cancer.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^11651Aaa]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

MRI

MRI shows a wide spectrum of appearances depending on the amount of inflammatory reaction, liquefied fat and the degree of fibrosis. The necrotic central fat is isointense or slightly lower signal on saturated T1-weighted images than the remaining fat in the breast. The "Black hole" sign of fat necrosis had been described with marked hypointensity on STIR images when compared with surrounding fat. The surrounding fibrosis shows enhancement on post-gadolinium images; the enhancement being most marked in the early stages of fat necrosis and decreasing with time. The enhancement may be thin, thick, irregular or spiculated and may mimic malignancy. Kinetic analysis is of little help in granulomatous fat necrosis as the full spectrum of enhancement patterns can be seen (Fig. 5).

CT

CT findings of fat necrosis are not well described but tend to correspond with MRI findings with central fat and peripheral enhancement if contrast is given. The fibrosis has attenuation values similar to fibroglandular tissue or linear densities resembling fibrous bands. Calcifications occasionally are seen on CT.

Histology

Histologically, fat necrosis within the breast occurs when there is vacuolisation and saponification of the remnants of the necrotic fat, which become surrounded by lipid-laden macrophages, multinucleated giant cells and acute inflammatory cells. Fibrosis develops, enclosing the area of necrotic fat and cellular debris (Fig. 5).

### Multi-protein spatial signatures in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of breast [^112ehbkK]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The successful implementation of the breast screening program in developed countries has resulted in the identification of a large number of putative precursor lesions of invasive carcinoma. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor lesion that is managed aggressively. Most patients get treated with surgery followed by post-operative radiation therapy. These therapies have been documented to decrease the incidence of recurrence and development of invasive cancer. In addition, the UK/ANZ DCIS trial and the NSABP B-24 clinical trials further demonstrated a significant reduction in frequency of DCIS recurrence by the addition of endocrine therapy with resultant recurrence rates below 10%. –

DCIS, if left untreated, will progress to invasive carcinoma in only around 20–50% of patients. – This has led to significant concerns regarding overtreatment of patients. Currently, there are many trials that are enrolling patients with DCIS for non-surgical management based on histological features of DCIS. Low risk DCIS cases are being enrolled in the LORIS trial in the United Kingdom, LORD trial in Europe and LARRIKIN trial in Australia for non-surgical management by active surveillance. – This is similar to the COMET (comparing operative to monitoring and endocrine therapy for low risk DCIS) trial in the USA. Inclusion criteria of the COMET Trial include women 40 years or older with screen-detected calcification associated with histologically confirmed low-grade (LG) or intermediate-grade (IG) DCIS. The LORIS Trial and LORD Trial also study screen-detected calcification associated with LG or IG DCIS. However, there are some differences in age of eligibility, whether patients with bilateral or multicentric disease, prior breast disease or mantle radiation can be enrolled. The presence of comedo-necrosis is an important exclusion criterion in some of these trials. These histological features are subjective and there is poor inter-observer agreement due to intratumoural heterogeneity. – A recent survey of more than 30 international recognised breast pathologists documented marked variability in definition of comedo-necrosis. This subjectivity will significantly impact patient enrolment and final study results. There is a clear need for better understanding the biology of DCIS and the pathways leading to (or associated with) progression.

### Malignant melanoacanthoma [^111uRYHG]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Melanoacanthomas are benign variations of seborrheic keratosis that have been known to mimic other common benign and malignant skin lesions. Therefore, the diagnosis typically requires biopsy and careful histologic examination. Here, we present the case of a 25-year-old woman initially diagnosed clinically with an epidermal inclusion cyst, but, on biopsy and further evaluation, was found to have histological features of an atypical or malignant melanoacanthoma. Contrary to typical cases of melanoacanthoma, histologic evaluation revealed atypical findings consistent with malignancy, such as tumor necrosis, marked cytologic atypia and pleomorphism, and numerous mitoses, including atypical forms, features consistent with malignancy (ie, similar to a squamous cell carcinoma in these areas). This report highlights the importance of histological evaluation in diagnosis and treatment of skin lesions because atypical presentations often occur and can delay correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Multiplatform molecular analyses refine classification of gliomas arising in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^111xZgDn]. Acta Neuropathologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient cohort

The study cohort consisted of 47 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who underwent surgical sampling of a glioma (Supplementary Table 1 [Online Resource 1]). The diagnosis of NF1 was established either by: 1) sequencing of a normal constitutional DNA sample isolated from peripheral blood or buccal swab demonstrating a deleterious/pathogenic mutation or deletion of the NF1 gene, or 2) the combination of established clinical diagnostic criteria along with tumor-only genomic profiling revealing biallelic NF1 inactivation (i.e. single NF1 mutation with allele frequency > 50% consistent with a heterozygous germline event combined with loss of heterozygosity, or alternatively two or more NF1 mutations with one present at ≥ 50% allele frequency consistent with representing a heterozygous germline event). This study complied with all relevant ethical regulations and was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board.

Histopathologic review of glioma specimens

Detailed pathologic examination was retrospectively performed on the entire glioma cohort to investigate their histologic and immunohistochemical features. Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and immunohistochemical stains from the 47 gliomas were digitally scanned on an Aperio slide scanner to assemble a digital pathology library composed of 345.SVS image files (308 Gigabytes of histology data) from which histologic and immunohistochemical features were reviewed and annotated using ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems). Histologic features that were individually annotated for each glioma include predominant growth pattern, cellular density, cellular morphology, cytoplasmic features, stroma, multinucleated cells, Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, calcifications, perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, hemosiderin deposits, dysmorphic ganglion cell component, mitoses per 2 mm 2, vascular endothelial proliferation, and necrosis. An overall histologic impression for each glioma was made as either pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma, or high-grade astrocytoma. The histologic designation of anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma was used for those gliomas with piloid features including Rosenthal fibers that had elevated mitotic activity (> 3 mitoses per 2 mm 2) with or without necrosis. The histologic designation of high-grade astrocytoma was used for those gliomas lacking Rosenthal fibers that had elevated mitotic activity (> 3 mitoses per 2 mm 2) with or without necrosis.

### Clinicopathological and prognostic value of calcification morphology descriptors in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149RG8j]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Screening mammograms frequently reveal the presence of calcifications, a majority of which are associated with benign changes in breast tissue. However, a minority of these calcifications may be linked to invasive breast cancer (IBC) or its non-obligatory precursor, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

The introduction of systematic mammographic screening has significantly increased DCIS detection, as up to 90% of DCIS lesions are detected due to calcifications on mammography. Nevertheless, the anticipated decrease in mortality due to increased DCIS treatment has not been as significant as expected, supporting the corpus of evidence that many DCIS lesions would remain harmless if left untreated. Currently, it is not possible to differentiate accurately between calcifications associated with DCIS that will progress to IBC, i.e. high-risk DCIS, and those that remain indolent, i.e. low-risk DCIS. Consequently, all DCIS cases receive treatment, resulting in overtreatment of low-risk DCIS.

Given the heterogeneity of DCIS in terms of morphology, biology, genetics, and outcome, mammographic calcification patterns and distributions may reflect the disease's heterogeneity.

The American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) standardizes these patterns, classifying calcifications with a suspicious morphology into four categories, (1) amorphous, (2) coarse heterogeneous, (3) fine pleomorphic, and (4) fine linear or fine linear branching. It is noteworthy that not all mammographically observed calcifications are related to DCIS or invasive breast cancer. Amorphous calcifications are only associated with malignancy in about 20% of cases, whereas the positive predictive value of fine linear calcifications is higher (70–80%). In DCIS, calcifications are most commonly linear, linear branching, and fine pleomorphic, in a linear distribution.

Investigating the association between calcification morphology descriptors (CMDs) and specific clinicopathological factors of DCIS lesions, such as grade, receptor-based surrogate subtypes based on hormone receptors and HER2, and the risk of local DCIS or IBC recurrence could provide clinicians with valuable insights into the likelihood of DCIS progression and lesion aggressiveness. Accurately determined CMDs may enable clinicians to make better-informed decisions regarding the necessity of further diagnostic procedures, such as biopsies. However, despite numerous studies, the prognostic value of mammographic calcification descriptors remains unclear.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between mammographic CMDs and clinicopathological factors in women with DCIS, while evaluating the overall quality of evidence and identifying sources of bias.

### Chondroid syringoma with osteoma cutis [^113PimtM]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Histologic diagnosis

Histology demonstrated a well-circumscribed lobulated dermal nodule composed of epithelial structures in a myxomatous and chondroid stroma with irregular branching tubules and ducts. Calcium was present as well as focal areas of ossification (Fig 3, A-C).

Key message

Chondroid syringomas represent a relatively rare, mixed tumor of the skin that is thought to be of apocrine or eccrine origin. They commonly present as an asymptomatic, slow-growing nodule on the head and neck of older men. Histologically, they present with varying ductal epithelial structures distributed within a chondromyxoid and fibrous stroma. The presence of ossification in chondroid syringoma is exceedingly rare. Dermatoscopy can provide an adjunctive measure for diagnosis of this adnexal neoplasm. The most predominant dermatoscopic feature for distinguishing dystrophic calcification and ossification in this tumor is the presence of white pleomorphic dots and globules, which, combined with the arborizing-like vessels, impart a marbled appearance. This is a novel dermatoscopic feature not previously reported. Definitive treatment is by wide local excision with clear margins for prevention of recurrence.

- neoadjuvant therapy (and type)

- operative procedure

- tumor anatomic site

- tumor size (greatest dimension)

- tumor location and extent of invasion: Add 'surface' if tumor originates on periosteal surface (especially relevant for osteosarcoma subtypes); Add 'intracompartmental' or 'extracompartmental' (especially relevant for defining atypical cartilaginous tumors)

- presence of skip metastases (discontinuous tumor)

- histologic tumor type (WHO Classification)

- histologic tumor grade

- presence and extent of necrosis

- treatment effect and extent

- margin status: R0, R1, or R2 (R classification system per AJCC); Distance to and localization of closest margin(s); Necrotic tumor at margin for Ewing sarcoma is considered a negative (R0) margin if there is a complete pathologic response

- ancillary studies: Decalcification should optimally be performed with solutions that preserve RNA and DNA; acid-based decalcification (other than EDTA) should therefore be avoided

### Evaluating agreement, histological features, and relevance of separating pleomorphic and florid lobular carcinoma in situ subtypes [^112E3G8V]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Morphological variants of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) include classical (CLCIS), pleomorphic (PLCIS) and florid type (FLCIS). Treatment guidelines suggest managing PLCIS and FLCIS like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); therefore accurate identification of LCIS subtypes is critical. However, the significance of separating PLCIS from FLCIS is not clear. Also, interobserver agreement in identifying LCIS subtypes, using contemporary criteria, is not known. We aimed to evaluate interobserver agreement amongst breast pathologists in diagnosing LCIS subtypes and use the agreement data to justify LCIS classification for management purposes. Six breast pathologists independently reviewed 50 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides comprised of a mix of LCIS subtypes. After reviewing published criteria, participants diagnosed PLCIS, CLCIS and apocrine change in a marked region of interest and FLCIS based on entire section. PLCIS was identified in 8 to 37 slides with overall moderate agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.565) and pairwise κ (Cohen's) ranging from -.008 to 0.492. FLCIS was diagnosed in 15–26 slides with overall substantial agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.687) and pairwise κ ranging from -.068 to 0.706. Both FLCIS and PLCIS coexisted in 45% of slides with consensus on non-classical LCIS. Comedo-type necrosis (odds ratio = 5.5) and apoptosis (odds ratio = 1.8) predicted FLCIS. We found moderate and substantial agreement in diagnosing PLCIS and FLCIS respectively. Objective histological features linked with aggressive behavior were more frequent with FLCIS. PLCIS and FLCIS patterns frequently coexist, contain similar molecular aberrations, and are managed similarly (like DCIS); therefore, combining FLCIS and PLCIS into one category (non-classical LCIS) should be considered.

### Clinicopathological and prognostic value of calcification morphology descriptors in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NQKtK]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and meta-analysis

Out of the 17 clinicopathological factors reported across 29 studies, 14 factors were significantly association in at least one study (Table 2). A meta-analysis was conducted for five clinicopathological factors, deemed sufficiently homogeneous across 20 studies (Fig. 2): high grade (n = 11), HER2 overexpression (n = 4), ER positivity (n = 4), (comedo)necrosis (n = 5), and the presence of (micro)invasion) (n = 5). The meta-analysis shows the aggregated results for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk CMDs concerning the clinicopathological factors.

Fig. 2
The meta-analysis results for each clinicopathological factor in a forest plot. For the calcification morphology descriptor (CMD) risk groups, the pooled odds ratios (pORs), 95% confidence intervals and associated p -values are shown. Furthermore, associated heterogeneity measures (I 2, P (Q)) and publication bias (Egger's p -value), as well as certainty of evidence summarized in the GRADE score are given. The low-risk CMDs served as a reference. Per CMD risk-group, details on the studies (number, number of calcified lesions, and number of cases) are given

High-risk CMDs demonstrated a significant association with four clinicopathological factors including high grade (pOR, 4.92; 95% CI, 2.64–9.17), (comedo)necrosis (pOR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.29–9.30), (micro)invasion (pOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03–2.27), and ER positivity (pOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.89). High-risk CMDs were negatively associated with ER positivity, indicating a reduced incidence of ER positivity in high-risk versus low-risk CMDs.

Intermediate-risk CMDs were significantly associated with high grade (pOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.44–2.96) and (comedo)necrosis (pOR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.87–3.54), while showing an increased pOR of 1.66 (95% CI, 0.92–2.99) with a p -value of 0.09 for (micro)invasion.

### Calcifications of lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^1136mMeh]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Because lobular carcinoma in situ is thought to be an incidental finding at breast pathology, the finding of lobular carcinoma in situ at core biopsy poses a diagnostic dilemma of radiologic-pathologic concordance. The purpose of this article is to describe the radiologic-pathologic correlation of calcifications associated with lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast.

Materials and Methods

Between July 1999 and July 2000, seven excisional biopsies resulted in findings of lobular carcinoma in situ of mammographic calcifications. The radiographic features of the calcifications were characterized by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon, and pathologic features were reviewed.

Results

Two forms of lobular carcinoma in situ were associated with calcifications: the classic form with small, uniform cells, and the pleomorphic form with larger cells frequently associated with central necrosis. On mammography, all calcifications were clustered, punctate, high density, and smaller than or equal to 0.5 mm, although mammographically visible calcifications found in the pleomorphic type tended to be larger and more dense. Additionally, infiltrating lobular carcinoma was found after surgical excision in two (40%) of five patients with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ.

Conclusion

Calcifications can be associated with lobular carcinoma in situ and therefore concordant at stereotactic core biopsy. The classic form may be incidental and clinically innocuous. The pleomorphic form is morphologically similar to ductal carcinoma in situ and may have a greater tendency for invasion.

2.3 Central pathological review

The central pathology review was performed conjointly by two neuropathologists (ATE and PV). Samples were stained with hematoxylin–phloxin–saffron (HPS) according to standard protocol. For each case, the following pathological features were researched: diffuse or circumscribed growth pattern (based on histopathology — entrapped neurons in the tumor — and using neurofilament staining), microvascular proliferation, tumoral necrosis, calcification, dysmorphic ganglion cells, perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, eosinophilic granular bodies, Rosenthal fibers, pseudorosettes, xanthomatous cells, nuclear pseudoinclusions, desmoplasia (on reticulin staining), multinucleated cells, spindle cell components, neuropil islands, embryonal components, and oligodendroglioma‐like components. Mitotic count was monitored using 10 high‐power fields (HPF) which corresponded to 3.2 mm 2 on our microscope and was counted jointly by two neuropathologists in a hot‐spot area. Integrated diagnoses were performed in accordance with the current WHO classification.

### Chondroblastoma: varied histologic appearance, potential diagnostic pitfalls, and clinicopathologic features associated with local recurrence [^117FuXic]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Chondroblastoma is a rare, benign bone tumor. Although it has distinctive clinicopathologic features, its wide morphologic spectrum may pose diagnostic problems. We present the clinicopathologic features of 42 patients (28 males, 14 females; age range, 8 to 66 years), with emphasis on unusual histologic features, potential diagnostic pitfalls, and factors associated with recurrence. Thirty-four tumors were in long bones, with the most common site being the proximal femur. Unusual histologic features included the presence of atypical, epithelioid, spindle, and foamy cells and necrosis and a diffuse basophilic myxoid matrix. Tumors with focal osteoclast-like giant cell rich areas (n = 11), prominent cystic change (n = 8) and extensive fibromyxoid areas (n = 3) resembled giant cell tumors, aneurysmal bone cysts, and chondromyxoid fibromas, respectively. The diagnosis of referring pathologists was inaccurate in 34% of cases. Six patients (14%) had local recurrence. The only clinical feature significantly associated with increased risk of local recurrence was duration of symptoms for less than 6 months (log rank P = .003). None of the histologic features was significantly associated with recurrence. These included worrisome features such as cellular atypia, necrosis, and mitoses. None of the patients had metastases. An increased awareness of the morphologic spectrum of chondroblastomas will enable pathologists to avoid diagnostic pitfalls. We emphasize the need for a combined clinical, radiologic and histologic approach to the diagnosis of chondroblastomas.

### Identifying recurrences and metastasis after ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast [^114Y5cjv]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

Screen‐detected DCIS is generally asymptomatic (85%), although it can present with nipple discharge or as a lump. It appears on a mammogram either as a distortion and/or by its association with micro calcification, characterised by clustered calcifications with linear branching or casting in up to 80% of cases (reviewed by Grimm et al.). The appearance type may be associated with histology; for example, DCIS with comedo necrosis is more likely to have linear calcifications. However, as microcalcifications can be irregularly distributed and frequently skipped by more than 10 mm, mammography often underestimates the true histological extent of the DCIS by between 6 and 15 mm, and by even more in mammographically dense breasts. In many cases core biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, as similar microcalcifications are common in benign conditions.DCIS can also present on mammography without calcifications, such as soft‐tissue opacity alone or an asymmetric distortion.

### A 16-year-old male with a cerebellar mass [^1153UK2P]. Brain Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old male presented to an emergency room after falling on his head while inebriated. The patient had only a history of recent fatigue and demonstrated no focal neurological deficit. MRI revealed a cystic and solid, enhancing midline cerebellar lesion. A suboccipital craniotomy was performed. Histologically, the mass showed large bizarre cells arranged in sheets with admixed small lymphocytes. The pleomorphic population had ample glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions. An infiltrating component resembling diffuse astrocytoma could be found in areas. Rosenthal fibers were particularly abundant in the areas of infiltrating glioma. Mitotic activity was very low, and necrosis was absent. Reticulin fibers between individual cells were focally abundant. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin were strongly expressed in many cells, while synaptophysin and neurofilament protein were not. Ki-67 showed a very low proliferation index. The pathologic diagnosis was pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) of the cerebellum. PXA is a diagnosis typically regarded as a superficial meningocerebral neoplasm. This case is one of sixteen cerebellar PXAs reported in the literature.

### A 45-year old male with left-sided hemihypesthesia [^112obaMx]. Brain Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old man presented with progressive brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. Extensive immunological and radiological investigations were not able to differentiate between an intrinsic brain tumor and a demyelinating disease. Stereotactic biopsies of the brainstem were performed; the findings of abundant Rosenthal fibers, interjacent spindle-shaped and gemistocytic cells partially with dark and irregularly formed nuclei favored primarily the diagnosis of a malignant astrocytoma, although a demyelinating disease could not be definitely excluded. Facing the fulminant clinical course radio- and chemotherapy was initiated; however, the patient died of sepsis-associated multi-organ failure three and a half years after disease onset. Post mortem pathology finally revealed lesions with central amorphic necrosis surrounded by areas of significant demyelination, astrocytosis, microglia cells and macrophages typical for MS. Although criteria for establishing MS are well known, a correct diagnosis can be extremely challenging in small stereotactic specimens, where so-called pathological hallmarks are spared and unusual pathological findings are predominant.

### Calcifications associated with basal cell carcinoma: prevalence, characteristics, and correlations [^112CAk64]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoma-associated calcifications (Ca(2+)) are a common phenomenon. In the skin, basal cell carcinomas (BCC) can be associated with Ca(2+).

Objective

To examine the prevalence, characteristics, and clinicopathologic correlations of BCC associated with Ca(2+).

Material and Methods

Eighty-three BCC with Ca(2+) were retrieved, 27 (11.1%) of which were identified from a review of 243 consecutive BCC. Ca(2+) were classified into 4 types: type 1, Ca(2+) within BCC epithelium; type 2, Ca(2+) in BCC keratocysts; type 3, BCC tumor necrosis with Ca(2+); and type 4, free Ca(2+) adjacent to BCC. Clinical and pathologic features were assessed and compared with BCC without Ca(2+). Expression of hair-associated proteins (hair keratins (K31, K32, and K35) and matrical transcription factors (LEF1, HOXC13, and β-catenin) were examined in a subset of BCC with Ca(2+) and compared with matched controls without Ca(2+).

Results

Compared with BCC without Ca(2+), BCC with Ca(2+) were significantly more likely to show a nodular keratinizing phenotype with keratocyst formation, background solar elastosis, active regression, and areas of tumor necrosis (all P ≤ 0.03). Comparing all BCC, high-risk BCC (mostly infiltrative) had significantly higher frequency of Ca(2+) than low-risk (mostly nodular) BCC (44% vs. 25%; P = 0.009). The median and mean number of Ca(2+) deposits per specimen were 2 and 3 ± 4, range 1–30. In decreasing frequency, type 2 Ca(2+) (58%), type 4 (53%), type 3 (14%), and type 1 (10%) were found. In 9 cases (11%), type 2 and type 4 Ca(2+) were linearly arranged, ostensibly after a follicular or eccrine duct tract. In 5 cases (6%), initial histologic sections showed type 4 dermal Ca(2+) without evidence of BCC; level sections revealed BCC in the adjacent tissue. Neither BCC with nor BCC without Ca(2+) showed evidence of matrical differentiation by immunophenotypic analysis.

Conclusions

A minority of BCC exhibits Ca(2+) that are associated with BCC-related keratin and/or necrosis. Like other follicular-derived tumors (trichilemmal cyst, pilomatricoma, and trichoepithelioma), BCC produce keratins that are ostensibly predisposed to calcification but are not related to matrical differentiation (mature hair keratin formation). Either due to transtumor elimination or due to tumor regression, Ca(2+) are frequently found free in solar elastotic or fibrotic dermis: a histologic clue in sun-damaged skin to the presence of BCC in the surrounding dermis.

### Understanding a mass in the paraspinal region: an anatomical approach [^114x7Bp1]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoblastomas are bone-forming tumours with a particular predilection for the spine. Spinal osteoblastomas form one-third of all osteoblastomas. On CT imaging, osteoblastomas typically appear as lytic expansile lesions with internal calcifications and a sclerotic rim. Less frequently, they can exhibit a bubbly appearance, or an aggressive appearance without sclerotic margins and can be heavily calcified (Fig. 12). MRI features of the lesion tend to be non-specific, with hypo- to isointensity on T1WI and hypo- to hyperintensity on T2WI and areas of decreased intensity related to calcifications. MRI typically exhibits significant peritumoural bone inflammation and paraspinal soft tissue inflammation with hyperintensity on T2WI and high enhancement after contrast administration, referred to as the 'flare phenomenon'. A discrepancy between the localised tumour observed on CT images and the huge reactive changes in the paraspinal soft tissues observed on MRI is strongly suggestive of osteoblastoma.

Chordomas are bone tumours derived from embryological remnants of the notochord. Typical radiological features consist of lytic bone destruction and a disproportionately large soft tissue mass with a 'mushroom appearance'. Calcifications, septa and internal matrix mineralisation are frequent. MRI shows predominant high intensity on T2WI, hypointensity on T1WI and heterogeneous enhancement.

Giant cell tumours (GCTs) are characterised by abundant multinucleated, osteoclastic giant cells. Spinal GCTs extend to the paravertebral soft tissues in almost two-thirds of cases. On radiographs and CT imaging, GCTs are expansile, lytic, eccentric lesions without calcification. A sclerotic rim and bony septa may appear at the border of the tumour that extends to one side of the centre of the vertebra (Fig. 30). T2WI typically reveals a low-signal-intensity lesion. GCTs can contain necrosis and haemorrhages with fluid–fluid levels or cystic areas with high intensity on T1WI and T2WI.

### Massive calcification in a pleomorphic adenoma: report of an unusual presentation [^1119Yzhz]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of histology-proven pleomorphic adenoma of the parapharyngeal space in a 20-year-old man. This case was unusual in that a massive amount of dystrophic calcification was scattered throughout the tumor. The patient underwent successful surgical resection, and he exhibited no signs of recurrence during follow-up. Literature about such an unusual presentation is scarce.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for chordoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to histopathology, NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend to include the following features in the pathology report for resection specimens (synoptic reporting according to the College of American Pathologists protocol is required for accreditation purposes):

- neoadjuvant therapy (and type)

- operative procedure

- tumor anatomic site

- tumor size (greatest dimension)

- tumor location and extent of invasion: Add 'surface' if tumor originates on periosteal surface (especially relevant for osteosarcoma subtypes); Add 'intracompartmental' or 'extracompartmental' (especially relevant for defining atypical cartilaginous tumors)

- presence of skip metastases (discontinuous tumor)

- histologic tumor type (WHO Classification)

- histologic tumor grade

- presence and extent of necrosis

- treatment effect and extent

- margin status: R0, R1, or R2 (R classification system per AJCC); Distance to and localization of closest margin(s)

- ancillary studies: Decalcification should optimally be performed with solutions that preserve RNA and DNA; acid-based decalcification (other than EDTA) should therefore be avoided

### Spectrum of germ cell tumors: from head to toe [^117Njg3A]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Germ cell tumors (GCTs) occur most frequently in the gonads and are relatively rare in other sites, such as the pineal gland, neurohypophysis, mediastinum, and retroperitoneum. GCTs are thought to originate from primordial germ cells, which migrate to the primitive gonadal glands in the urogenital ridge. Extragonadal GCTs might also originate from these cells when the cells are sequestered during their migration. Pathologic subtypes of GCTs vary, and the prevalence of mixed tumors is high. These factors produce a diversity of radiologic findings and make prospective radiologic diagnosis difficult in many cases. However, similar radiologic findings have been observed in pathologically equivalent tumors in varying sites. Seminomas appear as uniformly solid, lobulated masses with fibrovascular septa that enhance intensely. Nonseminomatous GCTs appear as heterogeneous masses with areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic degeneration. Fat and calcifications are hallmarks of teratomas, most of which are benign. In immature teratomas, scattered fat and calcification within larger solid components are occasionally seen. These imaging characteristics reflect the pathologic features of each tumor, and histologically similar GCTs at varying sites have similar radiologic features. Knowledge of the pathologic appearances of GCTs and their corresponding radiologic appearances will allow radiologists to diagnose these tumors correctly.

### The clinical and molecular landscape of diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant [^111Ab1mJ]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Central Pathology Review

We collected 102 tumor specimens from the 114 patients with H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma. In total, tumors from 89 patients were subjected to central pathology review at the Brain Tumor Reference Center of the German Society for Neuropathology and Neuroanatomy (DGNN), Institute of Neuropathology, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (G.R. J.F.). The histological review was based on microscopical investigation of hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-stained sections that were available from 64 tumors (51 patients) or on evaluation of high-resolution whole-slide digital scans of H&E-stained sections that were available for 38 tumors (38 patients) or both. For 25 patients, neither microscopical sections nor digital scans were available for central review. For these patients, classification relied on the local diagnoses and the molecular findings obtained by H3–3A mutation analysis and DNA methylome profiling (see below). Tumors for which glass slides or digital scans were available were centrally confirmed as high-grade diffuse astrocytic gliomas and evaluated for the following morphological features: tumor cell density (low, moderate, high), pleomorphism (low, moderate, high), presence of a small cell PNET-like component (yes, no), mitotic rate (number of mitoses per 10 high power fields at 400× magnification corresponding to 2.37 mm 2), presence of necrosis (yes, no), presence of pathologic microvascular proliferation (yes, no), presence of necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation (yes, no), presence of multinucleated giant cells (yes, single, no), and presence of calcifications (yes, no). All tumors were classified as diffuse hemispheric gliomas, H3 G34-mutant based on the integration of histologic and molecular features as recommended in the fifth edition of the WHO classification of tumors of the CNS, with molecular features corresponding to demonstration of an H3 G34 missense mutation or an assignment to the corresponding DNA methylation class of the Heidelberg brain tumor classifier or both.

MRI of DCIS during lactation. Images of a 40-year-old PABC patient (lactating for 4 months) with DCIS confirmed on operation are presented. The patient underwent screening mammography with adjuvant breast US (not presented) due to the extremely dense breasts on mammography (BI-RADS D) (c). Mammography revealed suspicious pleomorphic micro-calcifications in segmental distribution along 6 cm in the left upper outer quadrant (c). Pre-operative MRI showed NME on top of the surrounding prominent lactation-induced BPE, typical for DCIS, in agreement with the calcifications location (a). Furthermore, an excellent tumor delineation was afforded by non-fat surpassed T2-weighted image, showing hypo-intense region in the tumor area (b)

The patient palpate a lump in the left breast during the third trimester of pregnancy and underwent breast US (not presented) which depicted a benign appearing 9 mm oval mass. Upon follow-up 3 months later, post-partum, focal US depicted irregular mass with calcifications. Further diagnostic workup included US-guided biopsy, mammography which revealed extremely dense breast with segmental distribution of suspicious micro-calcifications in the inner-lower quadrant (b and zoomed image c), as well as breast MRI (a) which showed the characteristic NME of DCIS along 42 mm, in agreement with the mammographic findings, on top of the moderate background enhancement (BPE 2)

### Atypical evolution of a calcified lipid cyst presenting spontaneously as a suspicious cluster of microcalcifications [^113h4HKr]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report an infrequent mammographic case in which a gross-calcified lipid cyst evolved spontaneously to form a cluster of pleomorphic microcalcifications which were indistinguishable from those seen in breast cancer. The biopsy performed was consistent with fat necrosis. Ultrasonography of the specimen showed a nodule with mixed echogenicity surrounded by a hypoechoic rim. To our knowledge, this behavior is extremely rare, with only one similar case reported in the literature.

### Identification of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma: a comparison of clinicopathological and cytogenetic features with those of typical synovial sarcoma [^114cwRTF]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Poorly differentiated areas in synovial sarcomas (SS) are known to be associated with a poorer prognosis. The aim of our study was to describe the morphological spectrum of poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas (PDSS) and refine the criteria for their recognition.

Methods and Results

The clinicopathological features of 28 PDSS were compared with those of 26 classic SS. Common cell types in PDSS included epithelioid, spindle and Ewing sarcoma-like small round cells. Unusual features included presence of desmoplastic small cell tumour-like areas and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma-like areas. The presence of necrosis (P = 0.002), a mitotic rate over 10/10 high-power fields (P < 0.001), a haemangiopericytomatous vascular pattern (P < 0.001) and vascular invasion (P = 0.003) were significantly associated with PDSS, while mast cells (P < 0.001), calcification (P < 0.001) and hyaline bands (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with classic SS. Poorly differentiated areas showed increased proliferative activity with Ki67. PDSS showed a tendency to be larger (P = 0.008) and to be located in proximal more than distal sites (P = 0.025). Three entirely poorly differentiated tumours were diagnosed by demonstration of the t(X;18)(p11; q11) translocation. PDSS showed additional cytogenetic abnormalities.

Conclusions

Poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas show a spectrum of histological features, which may simulate other malignant neoplasms. The diagnosis of entirely poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas requires cytogenetic analysis.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: radiological-pathological correlation [^115LYHhE]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Malignant entities

Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer (PABC)

Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within the first year after delivery is referred to as pregnancy-associated breast cancer. It accounts for 1–2% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers each year and affects one out of every 3,000 live births. Typically presenting as a painless palpable lump, diagnosis is often delayed as physical examination of the pregnant and lactating breast is challenging. Overall, PABC is biologically aggressive with the majority of these tumours being oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative and Her2-neu receptor positive. The biological nature of these tumours consequently bodes a poorer prognosis. During pregnancy, ultrasound remains the optimal tool for imaging. However, if a suspicious finding is seen on the ultrasound in a pregnant patient, mammography should be performed. Imaging findings on both mammography and ultrasound of PABC is identical to cancer presenting in a non-pregnant or non-lactating woman. Ultrasound may reveal a circumscribed to spiculated hypoechoic to complex mass with irregular shape, posterior shadowing and non-parallel orientation (Fig. 14). Though cancers usually show posterior acoustic shadowing, in one study of 22 cases, posterior acoustic enhancement was seen in 12 of the 22 patients, likely reflecting the necrotic/cystic degeneration seen in these aggressive tumours. Other associated findings include thickening of the Cooper's ligaments, oedema, skin thickening and axillary lymphadenopathy. Mammography permits evaluation of microcalcifications, multifocality and multicentricity. Typically, a mass with or without associated pleomorphic calcifications is seen (Fig. 14). Secondary findings might include architectural distortion, nipple or skin retraction and lymphadenopathy. MRI is not typically done in pregnant patients, but can be safely performed in lactating patients. MRI is done for staging and to evaluate extent of disease. MRI may reveal a circumscribed to irregular mass with type II or type III enhancement kinetics. Other findings include non-mass-like enhancement and ductal enhancement.

### The complex of myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation and endocrine overactivity (Carney complex): imaging findings with clinical and pathological correlation [^114oSvgc]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Ductal adenomas (DAs)

The ductal adenomas of the breast were first reported by Azzopardi and Salm in 1984. It should be noticed that in that series, due to clinical (presentation in older patients), imaging (presence of suspicious microcalcifications), and pathological findings (cellularity and complexity pattern with invasion of the tumour capsule), these tumours were misinterpreted as breast carcinomas and two of those patients underwent radical mastectomy. Therefore, it is important to recognise DAs for two reasons. First, to avoid their misinterpretation as breast carcinoma and second, because they are a characteristic pathological entity for CNC as described by Carney and Toorkey. The presentation of DA could be even the primary manifestation of the complex.

Clinical features

Usually, DAs are palpable, painless masses near the areola, which can be asymptomatic or manifest as blood nipple discharge.

Pathological features

DAs involve ducts and are covered by a thick capsule of hyalinised fibrous tissue, which sometimes contains dystrophic calcifications. The shape of the tumour can be well delineated and spherical or completely irregular, with a diameter ranging from 10 to 40 mm. Their essential cellular components are (1) non-branching tubules of different size lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells and (2) connective tissue (Fig. 14).

Fig. 14
Photomicrograph (original magnification, 200×; H&E stain) of a ductal adenoma specimen shows roughly parallel longitudinally and transversely sectioned tubules in fibrous stroma. The tubules are lined by a single row of uniform epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is secretion in a number of the tubular lumens

Radiological features

DAs present as soft tissue tumours with well-defined or unclear margins, and they always contain calcifications. Calcifications seen in DA do not have a uniform appearance. Coarse calcifications (typically benign) or microcalcifications simulating adenocarcinoma have been described (Fig. 15). The differential diagnosis is difficult, and the presence of other CNC components or the coexistence of myxoid fibroadenomas in the same or the opposite breast can be helpful. FNA is always required.

Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (ESMC) originate from the nasal cavity have rarely been reported, especially its imaging features, which makes the preoperative diagnosis difficult. Here, we report the clinical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features of a 60-year-old female patient with pathologically confirmed ESMC in the nasal cavity to help provide more reference for diagnosis before operation. Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in the nasal cavity demonstrates typical imaging features, such as mesh-like enhancement, calcification, hemorrhage, necrosis, cystic degeneration, and so on.

### CT and MRI features of pure acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas in adults [^117VGkFS]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe the CT and MRI features of pure acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas in adults.

Materials and Methods

Eleven patients (six women and five men; mean age, 64 years) with acinar cell carcinoma, documented by pathologic examination of resected specimens, underwent CT (n = 9) or MRI (n = 2) examinations. Two radiologists evaluated imaging studies and determined, by consensus, the following data for each tumor: size, location, margination, internal density or signal intensity, and contrast enhancement pattern. In addition, they assessed the presence of calcification, pancreatic or bile duct dilation, and metastases. Imaging features were correlated with gross and microscopic pathologic features of the tumors.

Results

Masses were distributed throughout the pancreas (head, n = 5; body, n = 2; and tail, n = 4). The mean largest dimensions were 6.0 x 5.3 cm (range, from 2 x 1.7 to 15 x 11 cm). Tumors were oval (n = 5), round (n = 4), or lobular (n = 2). Ten (91%) masses were well marginated; nine (82%) were exophytic. Five (45%) masses enhanced homogeneously; the remaining tumors contained cystic areas. All masses enhanced less than the surrounding pancreas. Three (27%) masses contained calcifications. Four (80%) masses invaded the duodenum. Common bile and pancreatic duct dilatation was present in two and three patients, respectively. One patient had metastatic liver disease at presentation.

Conclusion

Pure acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas is usually an exophytic, oval or round, well-marginated, and hypovascular mass on CT and MRI. It typically is completely solid when small and contains cystic areas due to necrosis when large.

### An ulcerated violaceous nodule on the thigh [^114DPvuA]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What are the classic histopathologic findings for this diagnosis?
A. Von Hansemann cells with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies
B. Vascular calcification
C. Donovan bodies
D. Dermal neutrophilic infiltrate
E. Infiltrative sinusoidal pleomorphic endothelial cells and blood

Answers:
A. Von Hansemann cells with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies – Correct. An early histopathologic feature of malakoplakia, as seen in Fig 2, includes von Hansemann cells, or histiocytes with lightly-staining vacuolated cytoplasm. The intracytoplasmic vacuoles are periodic acid-Schiff–positive (Fig 3), diastase-resistant, and are thought to result from abnormal phagocytosis of bacteria. Calcified spherical inclusions arising from these vacuoles, Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, are pathognomonic for malakoplakia. Von Kossa and Perls' Prussian blue stain for iron can highlight the mineralization within these bodies and assist with diagnosis.
B. Vascular calcification – Incorrect. Calcification of small-to-medium blood vessels is characteristic of calciphylaxis, not malakoplakia. The necrosis in calciphylaxis is secondary to reactive intimal proliferation, thrombosis, and ischemia.
C. Donovan bodies – Incorrect. Donovan bodies are rod/oval-shaped organisms associated with granuloma inguinale, which is a rare sexually transmitted infection due to Klebsiella granulomatis. They can be identified intracellularly within the cytoplasm of histiocytes, but are not found in malakoplakia.
D. Dermal neutrophilic infiltrate – Incorrect. While early lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum can present on histopathology with sterile perifollicular inflammation, later lesions show an ulcerated epidermis and superficial dermis overlying a dense neutrophilic-predominant dermal infiltrate.
E. Infiltrative sinusoidal pleomorphic endothelial cells and blood – Incorrect. Infiltrative interwoven networks of sinusoidal vessels describe the histopathology findings of angiosarcoma, which can vary in cellular atypia, depending on the degree of differentiation. In poorly differentiated angiosarcoma, the endothelial lumen may not be visible, and cells can be highly mitotically active.

### Ductal carcinoma in situ: to treat or not to treat, that is the question [^111grwAh]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Current diagnosis and imaging

DCIS is usually straightforward to detect by mammography because of its association with calcifications; the proliferation of cells itself is not visible on the mammogram. However, as only 75% of all DCIS lesions contain calcifications, a substantial percentage of DCIS lesions will not be detected by mammography, implying that some lesions might be mammographically occult or that the diameter of the area containing calcifications underestimates the extent of DCIS. This suggests that DCIS might be left behind following breast-conserving treatment in a proportion of cases.

After detection, the lesion is classified by the pathologist by histological features as low, medium or high grade, which is assumed to correspond to the level of aggressiveness. Surprisingly, many grading systems exist. An agreement on classification was reached during a consensus meeting in the USA where consensus was reached to include nuclear grade, presence of necrosis, cell polarisation and architectural patterns in the pathology report. Some studies showed a slight tendency for high-grade DCIS to progress to invasive breast cancer, but others demonstrated that grade is not significantly associated with the risk of local invasive recurrence. Greater consistency in grading could result in more certainty about the association of morphology with progression and outcome. In addition, as grade is not a perfect discriminator for progression risk, other risk discriminators, such as molecular biomarkers, are examined (discussed later in 'Molecular, cellular and microenvironmental aspects').

Margin status after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) — invasive cancers and DCIS: For invasive breast cancer, including invasive breast cancer + DCIS, invasive breast cancer + extensive DCIS, and invasive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast-conservation therapy, the recommended negative margin is "no ink on tumor". For pure DCIS and DCIS with microinvasion, a "2-mm margin" is specified. For classic LCIS at surgical margin and atypia at surgical margin, "No margin necessary" is indicated. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated, and for pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), the optimal width of margins is not known.

### Stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: executive summary of an ASTRO evidence-based guideline [^111hJtPk]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without tissue confirmation is described as having no differences in local, nodal, or distant control between patients with or without histologic confirmation, with reported median OS (39.2 months vs. 40.2 months, p = 0.999), LC (3-year 90.4% vs. 91.2%, p = 0.982), and no differences in regional control (p = 0.947) or distant metastasis free survival (p = 0.980); SBRT can be reasonably considered in patients unable or unwilling to undergo biopsy when patients are well selected and at low predicted likelihood of a benign lung nodule, and any such case should be discussed at a tumor board or in a multidisciplinary manner with consensus that the lesion is radiographically consistent with malignancy based on lesion size, growth over time, spiculations or lack of benign-appearing calcifications, PET avidity, and location, while also considering smoking history, prior lung cancers, and regional environmental factors such as histoplasmosis incidence.

### Fat necrosis of the breast: clinical, mammographic and sonographic features [^114KzrJX]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

the purpose of this study was to describe and quantitate the clinical, mammographic and sonographic (US) features and to evaluate the evolution of fat necrosis in the breast.

Materials and Methods

a retrospective review of the clinical, mammographic and US findings of 126 fat necrosis lesions in 94 patients, diagnosed between 1989 and 1999, was done. All the cases included in the study had at least 3 years follow-up mammograms. In addition, 48 patients with a total of 62 fat necrosis lesions, also had an US follow-up. Fat necrosis was diagnosed on the basis of histologic (n = 25) and initial or follow-up imaging (n = 69) findings.

Results

the predominant mammographic features of the 114 lesions apparent on mammograms were radiolucent oil cyst (n = 34, 26.9%), round opacity (n = 16, 12.6%), asymmetrical opacity or heterogenicity of the subcutaneous tissues (n = 20, 15.8%), dystrophic calcifications (n = 34, 26.9%), clustered pleomorphic microcalcifications (n = 5, 3.9%), and suspicious speculated mass (n = 5, 3.9%). In five patients with 12 (9.5%) palpable masses, mammograms were normal. The predominant US features of the 112 lesions apparent on sonograms were solid (n = 18, 14.2%), anechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement (n = 21, 16.6%), anechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing (n = 20, 15.8%), cystic with internal echoes (n = 14, 11.1%), cystic with mural nodule (n = 5, 3.9%) and increased echogenicity of the subcutaneous tissues (n = 34, 26.9%). In five patients with 14 (11.1%) lesions, sonographic examination was normal. Mammographic follow-up showed that five of the radiolucent oil cysts developed curvilinear calcifications, six of the round opacities decreased in size and density, and another two disappeared. Eleven of the dystrophic calcifications became even more coarse. Six of the asymmetrical opacities became vague and one developed an oil cyst and coarse calcifications. The only nonoperated speculated mass developed a typical small radiolucent oil cyst in the centre. US follow-up showed that 18 of the 29 increased subcutaneous tissue echogenicity turned back to normal, while in the remaining 11 small cysts formed. In 19 solid appearing masses, 15 showed decrease in size, while four remained stable (biopsy disclosed fat necrosis). The four complex masses in two patients showed increase in size and appeared more cystic (FNAB was consistent with fat necrosis).

Conclusion

a spectrum of imaging findings is associated with fat necrosis. Knowledge of the mammographic and US appearance and evolution of these patterns may enable imaging follow-up of these lesions, reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.

### Pathology reporting of hepatoblastoma resections: recommendations from the international collaboration on cancer reporting [^111zHmon]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Block Identification Key

The origin/designation of all tissue blocks should be recorded and ideally documented in the final pathology report and is particularly important should the need for internal or external review arise. It may be useful to have a digital image of the specimen and record of the origin of the tumour blocks in some cases.

Recording the origin/designation of tissue blocks also facilitates retrieval of blocks for further immunohistochemical or molecular analysis, research studies or clinical trials.

Treatment Effect

The extent of tumour necrosis following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been suggested as an independent prognostic factor in newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma. However, it has not been confirmed in large clinical studies; therefore, this element is considered non‐core. Macroscopically, these are well‐demarcated areas of congestion/haemorrhage, calcifications and fibrosis. However, it is difficult to predict whether these areas represent necrosis or viable hepatoblastoma components; therefore, adequate sampling with a photographic tumour block diagram is useful.

Histological features include coagulative‐type necrosis, cystic degenerative changes, a fibrohistiocytic response with haemosiderin‐laden and/or foamy macrophages.

Also noted are:
So‐called peliosis‐like round foci surrounded by a thick fibrous wall showing no endothelial lining and containing densely packed erythrocytes in various stages of degeneration.
Peliotic foci characterized by rounded pools of blood within epithelial tumour sinusoids surrounded by tumour cells.
Bands of fibrosis adjacent to viable tumour/necrosis often containing ductular proliferations.
Increased osteoid formation and/or squamous/keratin formations often eliciting a foreign body‐type granulomatous response in mixed hepatoblastoma.

Chemotherapy effect on viable hepatoblastoma cells includes either differentiation into fetal epithelial hepatoblastoma or into pleomorphic/HCC‐like features. For all components, immunostaining for beta‐catenin and glypican‐3 is valuable.

### Has our understanding of calcification in human coronary atherosclerosis progressed? [^112fz7Sp]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcification is a well-established predictor of future cardiac events; however, it is not a predictor of unstable plaque. The intimal calcification of the atherosclerotic plaques may begin with smooth muscle cell apoptosis and release of matrix vesicles and is almost always seen microscopically in pathological intimal thickening, which appears as microcalcification (≥ 0.5 μm, typically < 15 μm in diameter). Calcification increases with macrophage infiltration into the lipid pool in early fibroatheroma where they undergo apoptosis and release matrix vesicles. The confluence of calcified areas involves extracellular matrix and the necrotic core, which can be identified by radiography as speckled (≤ 2 mm) or fragmented (> 2, < 5 mm) calcification. The calcification in thin-cap fibroatheromas and plaque rupture is generally less than what is observed in stable plaques and is usually speckled or fragmented. Fragmented calcification spreads into the surrounding collagen-rich matrix forming calcified sheets, the hallmarks of fibrocalcific plaques. The calcified sheets may break into nodules with fibrin deposition, and when accompanied by luminal protrusion, it is associated with thrombosis. Calcification is highest in fibrocalcific plaques followed by healed plaque rupture and is the least in erosion and pathological intimal thickening. The extent of calcification is greater in men than in women especially in the premenopausal period and is also greater in whites compared with blacks. The mechanisms of intimal calcification remain poorly understood in humans. Calcification often occurs in the presence of apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and macrophages with matrix vesicles accompanied by expression of osteogenic markers within the vessel wall.

Study characteristics

In all 29 studies, the data was collected retrospectively from hospital registries, national registries, or clinical trials. Cohort (n = 27), case–control (n = 1), and a case-cohort within a random control trial (n = 1) designs were used. Twenty were single-center studies, and 9 involved multiple centers. While 20 studies exclusively studied DCIS, nine studies included patients with both DCIS and IBC. The number of DCIS patients with calcifications per study ranged from 32 to 1783. Fifteen studies described calcification morphology according to the BI-RADS system, while the remaining 14 studies used non-BI-RADS descriptors. In ten studies, the lesions were described as only screen-detected, while in another ten studies, they were reported to be both screen-detected and non-screen-detected. The remaining studies did not specify the method of lesion detection. Thirteen studies specified using mammograms with calcifications only, without other mammographic abnormalities.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the selected studies between 2000 and 2022.

### Radiologic-pathologic correlation of ductal carcinoma in situ [^115zgFYV]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 20%-25% of breast cancers detected at screening mammography. The lesions are diverse and commonly are classified on the basis of their mammographic features and histologic characteristics such as nuclear grade and presence or absence of necrosis. The most common mammographic finding in DCIS is microcalcifications, but a low-grade lesion without necrosis is less likely to manifest with calcifications than either an intermediate- or a high-grade lesion. Other mammographic findings might include a mass or architectural distortion. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has higher sensitivity than mammography for the detection of DCIS and greater accuracy for depicting the extent of disease. The MR imaging appearance of DCIS depends primarily on the presence and extent of abnormal periductal or stromal vascularity. Nonmasslike enhancement, the most common MR imaging finding, is often seen in association with clumped internal enhancement. The enhancement kinetics in dynamic MR studies vary, and no kinetic pattern is pathognomonic of a particular nuclear grade of DCIS. However, the kinetic pattern at delayed imaging does appear to be correlated with the mammographic findings: Mass lesions show strong washout; fine pleomorphic, fine linear, and fine linear-branching calcifications demonstrate a plateau enhancement pattern; and amorphous calcifications exhibit persistent enhancement. Multidetector computed tomography might be a useful adjunct to MR imaging for preoperative mapping.

2 FINDINGS

Histological examination (Box 1) unveiled a lesion with two distinct morphological components: a highly cellular area in the superficial cortex and an area characterized by sparse cells in the central region (Figure 2). The highly cellular area consisted of dense spindle‐shaped tumor cells with round to oval or irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. These cells were set against an edematous, myxoid, or collagenous background, and were diffusely distributed throughout (Figure 2A). The hypocellular area housed scattered calcification foci and a fibrillary matrix with sparsely distributed, yet unremarkable, infiltrative tumor cells possessing oval nuclei (Figure 2B). Both components contained occasional interspersed degenerating neurons and large reactive astrocytes. No rhabdoid cells were present. Mitotic figures could be identified in some regions of high cellularity (up to 5 mitotic figures in 10 visual fields at magnification 400×), but not in the hypocellular areas. Necrosis was not found.

Histopathology and classification of DCIS

DCIS exhibits a range of architectural patterns such as solid, cribriform and micropapillary, with comedo necrosis being associated with a range of these subtypes. Historically, DCIS was classified into subtypes according to these architectural patterns. It is not unusual for multiple patterns to be observed in the same tumour, making such classification difficult to reproduce. Nuclear grade generated using nuclear size and pleomorphism is another commonly used parameter reported for DCIS, with grades I (low), II (intermediate) and III (high). The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has recently published core and non‐core clinicopathological features that should be reported by pathologists: clinical information, operative procedure, laterality, tumour dimensions, necrosis, margin status, micro calcification and staging are core. Non‐core features include architectural pattern, co‐existent pathology and ancillary studies such as oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) staining. For some features, such as necrosis and margin involvement, additional guidance around definition of central, focal and unifocal, multifocal and extensive, respectively, is additionally provided.

### Is there any association between mammographic features of microcalcifications and breast cancer subtypes in ductal carcinoma in situ? [^114H47VF]. Academic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To analyze the association between mammographic features of microcalcifications and histopathological prognostic factors based on estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively determined 66 patients with microcalcification-associated pure DCIS. Distribution and morphological features of the microcalcifications were described using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. All patients were divided into three subgroups: ER-positive, HER-2 positive, and triple-negative according to the immunohistochemical findings.

Results

The morphological features of microcalcifications and receptor subtypes were significantly correlated (p = 0.026). Fine pleomorphic and fine linear branching microcalcifications were observed in 85.2% of HER-2 positive cases, whereas this ratio was 71.4% in ER-positive and 25% in the triple-negative group. Fine linear branching microcalcifications with linear or segmental distribution were more frequently found with comedo necrosis (p < 0.05). Larger tumour sizes were also associated with microcalcification distribution (p < 0.001). Segmental microcalcifications more likely associated with larger tumour sizes.

Conclusion

Mammographic features in DCIS correlated with immunohistochemical and histopathological prognostic factors.

### Focal hand lesions: review and radiological approach [^117VuToW]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Malignant lesions

Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma

Previously known as malignant fibrous histocytoma, this is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in adults with a wide age range of 30–80 years old and a slight male predilection. It is thought to arise from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells and usually occurs in the soft tissues of the retroperitoneum and proximal extremities. Occurrence in the hand is rare. MR is the imaging modality of choice to stage and characterise the tumour. It is typically intermediate to low signal on T1w sequence and heterogeneously high signal on T2w sequence; however, appearance may vary depending on the presence of calcification, fibrous tissue, haemorrhage or necrosis (Fig. 15). The tumour is fairly well defined despite its malignant nature because of a pseudocapsule, but may exert a mass effect or encase neurovascular bundles. Other less common subtypes of pleomorphic sarcoma have been identified based on the proportion of myxoid, fibrous or cellular components.

This review outlines the features of papillary lesions of the breast and provides a practical approach to distinguishing diagnostically challenging lesions by using key morphologic features and, when helpful, immunohistochemical studies.

### Radiological appearances of papillary breast lesions [^113SCnn3]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

This review illustrates the varied appearances of benign and malignant papillary breast tumours, as identified by a breast cancer-screening programme. The commonest mammographic appearance of a papillary tumour is as a soft-tissue mass, with calcification present in less than half of cases. When calcification is present the pattern is variable, but clusters of pleomorphic calcification can occur, sometimes resembling the mammographic appearance of invasive ductal carcinoma. Ultrasonography of papillary lesions typically shows a solid, oval, intraductal mass, often associated with duct dilatation. A cystic component is also commonly seen, and lesions may appear hypervascular on colour Doppler ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a high sensitivity, but low specificity for detecting papillary tumours, and is useful in establishing the extent and distribution of lesions in patients with multiple papillomatosis. Despite a benign histology on core biopsy, an argument exists for complete surgical excision of all papillary tumours, as a significant proportion of papillomas will contain foci of atypia or overt malignant change.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^113jFenF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) — overlapping features between PMBL and CHL — typically presents with a large anterior mediastinal mass with or without supraclavicular lymph nodes and is more common in males, presenting between 20–40 y. Morphology warrants expert hematopathology review, diagnosis should not be made on a core needle biopsy, and tumors show large pleomorphic cells in a diffusely fibrous stroma that are typically larger and more pleomorphic than in PMBL; necrosis without neutrophilic infiltrate is frequent. Immunophenotype is atypical with transitional features between PMBL and CHL; the typical immunophenotype includes CD45+, PAX5+, BOB.1+, OCT-2+, CD15+, CD20+, CD30+, and CD79a+; CD10- and ALK-; with BCL6 variably expressed and EBV usually negative. If the morphology more closely resembles PMBL, CD20 dim/-; CD30+ and CD15+ would be suggestive of gray zone lymphoma, whereas if it more closely resembles CHL, strong uniform CD20+ (and/or other B-cell markers) and CD15- would be suggestive of MGZL. A worse prognosis than either CHL or PMBL has been suggested; while there is no consensus on the treatment, aggressive LBCL regimens are preferred, and if the tumor cells are CD20+, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy should be considered. Data suggest that the use of anthracycline-based chemoimmunotherapy as recommended for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (BCEL-C) is helpful, and if localized disease, then consolidative ISRT is preferred. Polatuzumab-R-CHP is not recommended for mediastinal gray zone lymphoma. Clinical and genomic data indicate that most non-mediastinal gray-zone lymphomas are distinct from MGZL; thus, patients with extra-mediastinal disease should be diagnosed as having DLBCL-NOS. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Subepidermal calcified nodule [^115gj8NT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Subepidermal calcified nodule is an uncommon, but specific subtype of idiopathic calcinosis. It presents as an asymptomatic, solitary, yellow-white or erythematous filiform tumor. The most common location is on the head and neck region of male children. Serum calcium and phosphorus levels are normal. Histopathologic examination reveals a focal papillary dermal collection of dark blue-staining, large, amorphous deposits, and/or small calcified globules surrounded by a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. The causes and histiogenesis of these deposits have not been fully established, but the most favored theory is that calcium is deposited on a preexisting lesion. The treatment of choice is surgical removal with histopathologic examination. We describe a healthy 11-year-old Caucasian boy with an asymptomatic, warty growth below his left eye. Excision with histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of subepidermal calcified nodule. There has been no sign of recurrence to date.

### Independent predictors of breast malignancy in screen-detected microcalcifications: biopsy results in 2545 cases [^117Kes4n]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Microcalcifications are one of the main categories of abnormalities detectable by mammograms. The widespread uptake of screening mammography has been associated with a marked increase in the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), as this lesion is frequently associated with dystrophic calcifications, particularly when comedo necrosis is present. At present, DCIS constitutes one in five screen-detected malignancies in our population-based breast cancer-screening programme.

In addition to malignat lesions, many non-malignant processes also produce dystrophic microcalcifications in breast tissue. In order to minimise invasive investigations, radiologists take into account the various characteristics of microcalcifications. The form, size, pleomorphism and distribution of the calcifications provide clues to the underlying pathology. Mammographic grading systems encapsulate the overall level of concern. The grading system used throughout Australia and parts of Europe is a five tier system that differs from the BI-RADs system used in North America. In this system, grade 3 lesions are regarded as indeterminate/equivocal and lesions graded 3 and above require imaging workup and possible biopsy.

In this study, we wished to review the outcomes of assessment of microcalcifications detected through screening mammography at our programme, with a particular interest in evaluating the discriminating capacity of the mammographic grading system used.

3.2 Histopathological and immunohistochemical characterization

All tumors were multinodular at low‐power magnification and were well‐circumscribed by a fibrous pseudocapsule (in 4/4 of the evaluable samples). Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates were present in 6/11 cases, constituting a peritumoral cuff in only three cases. Follicles with germinal centers were encountered in 1/11 cases. No multinucleate giant cells were present. Only one case (#10) presented blood‐filled pseudoangiomatoid spaces. A prominent myxoid stroma, representing more than 60% of the tumor surface in the available histological sections, was present in 8/11 cases. The cellular density was variable, low in nine tumors, and high in three cases (#1, 5, and 11). In 10/11 cases, tumor cells were histiocytoid or spindle‐shaped with mildly atypical oval or polygonal vesicular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm with ill‐defined borders. In one case (#1), tumor cells were epithelioid with clear cell cytoplasm. Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions were observed in all cases. In a subset of cases, hemosiderin deposition (6/11 cases) and cystic degeneration (3/11) were present. The vascularization was well‐developed with thin‐walled branching vessels (11/11 cases) or a pseudo‐angiomatous appearance (9/11 cases). No staghorn vessels were observed. Calcifications (but no psammoma bodies), osseous metaplasia, and a pseudochondroid matrix were evidenced in one case, respectively. Amianthoid fibers were observed in 6/11 cases. Necrosis was absent in all cases and mitoses were scant (0 to 8 per 10 high‐power fields, so 3.2 mm 2, with a mean of three mitoses), except in the recurrence of Case #1 which presenting necrosis and a high mitotic index (54 per 10 high‐power fields). Ki‐67 labeling activity was very low (1%–8%) in all primary tumors. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors expressed CD68 and EMA. Desmin was variably stained (absent in Case #1, focal in Cases #4 and 8, as part of tumor cells in cases #2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11, and diffuse in Case #10, respectively). CD99 (6/11), S100‐protein (9/11), and MUC4 (3/11 cases, with only focal staining) and CKAE1AE3 (1/11) were expressed in a subset of tumors. Focal expression of SSTR2A was evidenced in 3/11 cases. Staining for smooth muscle‐actin, CD34, GFAP, CD56, synaptophysin, SOX10, HMB45, Melan‐A, and ALK was constantly negative. INI1 expression was retained in all cases.

Radiologic and procedural factors collected were lesion size, lesion morphology and distribution on mammography, core biopsy needle caliber (small, 11–18 gauge; large, 7–9 gauge), and type of image guidance (stereotactic versus ultrasound). Existing pre and post-biopsy mammograms for all subjects were prospectively reexamined by a board-certified breast radiologist on high-resolution monitors from stored electronic image files to confirm lesion size (single greatest dimension of calcification/mass), calcification morphology (benign, amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, fine linear, or fine linear branching), calcification distribution (diffuse, regional, grouped, linear, or segmental), and to visually estimate the proportion of lesion biopsied (10% or less of the lesion removed, 11–50% of lesion removed, 51–89% of lesion removed, and 90% or greater of the lesion removed). Each radiologist performing the reexamination of films underwent a brief training on definitions and coding of lesional size and proportion biopsied. Calcification morphology and distribution patterns (Fig. 1) were classified using the descriptors outlined by the American College of Radiology. Pathologic factors included histologic results from the core needle biopsy report (suspicion of ductal carcinoma in situ, number of ADH foci, and presence of concurrent lobular or flat epithelial atypia).

### Solid malignant retroperitoneal masses-a pictorial review [^1174DuN5]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Myxoid liposarcomas tend to occur in younger patients. They are of intermediate-grade malignancy and are typically lobular lesions with attenuation less than that of muscle on CT. The homogeneous dispersal of fat and soft tissue throughout the lesion gives a 'pseudocystic' appearance, near fluid density, on non-contrast enhanced CT. They characteristically show gradual, heterogeneous enhancement. Calcification can occasionally be seen. Pleomorphic/round cell liposarcomas are high-grade sarcomas. They are the least common subtype overall. They appear as heterogeneous soft-tissue masses with little or no fat within and may contain areas of necrosis (Fig 1c).
