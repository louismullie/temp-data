## Question

In a 78-year-old male with hemoglobin 12.2, hematocrit 38, and platelet count 137, with other blood work normal, what differential diagnoses and workup should be considered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what differential diagnoses to consider and how to work up a 78-year-old man with mild anemia (Hb 12.2 g/dL, Hct 38%) and borderline thrombocytopenia (platelets 137 × 10⁹/L), including differential diagnosis, initial laboratory workup, interpretation framework, and management priorities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these values constitute clinically significant cytopenias in an older male and what the implications are. Then, I should verify the most likely and most serious causes in this age group. Next, I will outline a systematic workup, including reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, iron studies, inflammatory markers, renal and thyroid function, and targeted tests based on initial results. After that, I'll create an interpretation framework to separate hypoproliferative from destructive etiologies and parse iron study patterns. Finally, I will prioritize management steps, including when not to transfuse, when to treat iron deficiency, when to suspect MDS and refer, and how to monitor and follow up safely [^113HMPXu] [^111jFZne].

> Let me first confirm clinical significance. In an older man, Hb < 13.0 g/dL qualifies as anemia; at 12.2 g/dL this is mild but clinically meaningful given associations with frailty and adverse outcomes, so it warrants evaluation rather than dismissal as "age-related" anemia [^113HMPXu]. I should also verify that a platelet count of 137 × 10⁹/L represents true thrombocytopenia and not an artifact; repeating the count and reviewing a peripheral smear helps exclude EDTA-related pseudothrombocytopenia and assesses for dysplasia, which is particularly relevant if I'm concerned about clonal marrow disease in this age group [^113HMPXu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the context and indices. The RBC indices (MCV, MCH, RDW) and reticulocyte count are essential to classify the anemia and to determine if it's hypoproliferative versus regenerative, while a manual smear can reveal macrocytosis, dimorphism, ovalocytes, nucleated RBCs, teardrops, or dysplastic neutrophils suggestive of MDS or other marrow processes [^113HMPXu]. I should double-check whether "other blood work normal" includes iron studies, CRP/ESR, creatinine/eGFR, liver tests, and TSH, because "normal" is too vague to rule out common causes like AOCD, CKD, or iron deficiency in older adults [^113HMPXu].

> Next, I will develop a prioritized differential. Most common and modifiable causes include anemia of chronic inflammation/disease (typically normocytic with high/normal ferritin and low TSAT) and iron deficiency anemia, which in older men requires evaluation for occult gastrointestinal blood loss given notable malignancy risk; CKD-related anemia is also prevalent and can occur even with modest eGFR reduction due to decreased EPO production [^113HMPXu] [^1156qyBS] [^117Xp2Gv]. But wait, what if the two-lineage cytopenia hints at a clonal disorder? The combination of mild anemia and borderline thrombocytopenia raises suspicion for myelodysplastic syndrome in this age group and warrants careful smear review and, if supported by cytopenia trend or morphology, bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetics [^113HMPXu].

> I need to ensure I consider nutritional and endocrine etiologies. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often cause macrocytosis but can appear normocytic when mixed with iron deficiency or CKD; hypothyroidism can blunt erythropoiesis, so checking TSH is prudent in unexplained anemia [^113HMPXu] [^112qcPhA]. Let me reconsider: I almost said I'd only test B12/folate if MCV > 100 fL; however, mixed pictures can mask macrocytosis, so I should still test when clinical suspicion is present or the smear suggests macroovalocytes or hypersegmented neutrophils, even with borderline MCV [^113HMPXu] [^112qcPhA].

> Now I will design the initial workup. I will order a CBC with indices, absolute reticulocyte count, and a pathologist-reviewed peripheral smear; CRP and/or ESR for inflammation; serum creatinine with eGFR for CKD; liver panel; TSH; and a full iron panel with ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), interpreting ferritin in the context of CRP given its acute-phase behavior [^113HMPXu] [^112qcPhA]. If macrocytosis or clinical suspicion exists, I'll add B12 with methylmalonic acid if borderline, and RBC folate; if hemolysis is suspected (elevated reticulocytes or smear clues), I'll check LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin and perform a DAT; if cytopenias worsen or dysplasia is seen, I'll proceed to bone marrow aspiration/biopsy with cytogenetics and flow cytometry [^113HMPXu] [^112qcPhA].

> I should confirm iron deficiency patterns precisely. Iron deficiency typically shows low ferritin (< 30 ng/mL when inflammation is absent) and low TSAT; anemia of chronic inflammation shows normal/high ferritin with low TSAT; mixed states may yield ferritin 30–100 ng/mL with low TSAT, requiring clinical synthesis and possibly soluble transferrin receptor if ambiguity persists [^1156qyBS] [^112qcPhA]. Wait, let me verify that ferritin cutoff — ECCO emphasizes ferritin and TSAT as core elements of anemia workup and the need to interpret with CRP; AAFP adds pragmatic ferritin thresholds supportive of IDA diagnosis in primary care, which can be helpful when specialized markers are unavailable [^112qcPhA] [^1156qyBS].

> I will now examine the reticulocyte index to frame pathophysiology. A low reticulocyte index (< 2) suggests hypoproliferation consistent with AOCD, CKD, iron restriction, or clonal marrow disorders; a high reticulocyte index (> 2) points toward hemolysis or blood loss and should push me toward hemolysis labs and GI evaluation for occult bleeding, particularly in older men where GI sources are common and clinically important [^113HMPXu] [^1156qyBS]. But wait, what if plasma volume expansion is lowering Hb concentration despite normal red cell mass? While less common, volume status can influence Hb concentration and should be considered in heart failure or liver disease contexts when results don't fit the clinical picture, though this is typically a secondary consideration after completing the standard anemia evaluation [^1159rLSu].

> Hold on, I should verify the CKD piece. Even early CKD can contribute to anemia; if CKD is present and other reversible causes are corrected, ESA therapy is individualized with adult targets generally around 10–12 g/dL, avoiding intentional increases above 11.5 g/dL and certainly not above 13 g/dL due to risk, with monitoring intervals guided by CKD stage and clinical status [^116zSyq8] [^117Xp2Gv] [^114wzHmw] [^11529EC7]. I initially thought of pediatric targets; wait, to correct myself, the UK Kidney Association 2025 adult guidance emphasizes aiming for a population distribution centered near 110 g/L with intervention thresholds roughly 100–120 g/L, distinct from the lower target range recommended for children under 2 years, which does not apply here [^116Tii6A] [^114AwHr4].

> Next, management priorities. I should confirm there is no immediate indication for transfusion at Hb 12.2 g/dL in a stable outpatient; restrictive strategies in adults generally use thresholds near 7–8 g/dL, and perioperative anemia guidance focuses on identifying and correcting causes rather than transfusing at this level, so "do not transfuse" is appropriate here unless special circumstances (e.g., active ACS with ischemia) exist [^117XXkrE] [^111jFZne]. If iron deficiency is documented, treat with oral or IV iron depending on tolerance, inflammation, CKD status, and urgency; and if AOCD is identified, address the underlying inflammatory driver while avoiding unnecessary transfusions [^113HMPXu] [^112qcPhA].

> If MDS is suspected based on two-lineage cytopenias, dysplasia on smear, or progressive counts, I should refer to hematology for marrow examination with morphology and cytogenetics, as this alters prognosis and management; early diagnosis enables appropriate risk stratification and therapeutic planning, ranging from supportive care to disease-modifying therapy depending on IPSS-R risk [^113HMPXu]. I need to ensure I also review medications that can suppress marrow or cause bleeding, deprescribing or substituting as appropriate, because drug effects can mimic or worsen cytopenias in older adults [^113HMPXu].

> I will now outline follow-up. Recheck CBC with indices and reticulocytes in about 4–6 weeks to assess trajectory and treatment response; if CKD is present, align monitoring intervals with CKD guidance, with more frequent checks if on ESAs or if counts are unstable; escalate promptly to hematology if cytopenias progress, dysplasia is noted, blasts appear, or new symptoms develop [^113HMPXu] [^11529EC7]. But wait, I should verify GI evaluation timing — if iron deficiency is confirmed in a man over 50, endoscopic investigation for occult blood loss is indicated given the malignancy prevalence; deferring this risks missing a treatable cancer source [^1156qyBS].

> Bottom line: In this 78-year-old man with mild anemia and borderline thrombocytopenia, I need to confirm true cytopenias; perform a structured anemia workup including reticulocyte count, smear, iron studies with ferritin and TSAT interpreted alongside CRP, renal and thyroid function; and maintain high suspicion for MDS given two-lineage involvement in this age group, proceeding to marrow evaluation if supported by findings, while avoiding transfusion at this Hb and treating reversible causes such as iron deficiency or CKD-related anemia per guideline targets and safety thresholds [^113HMPXu] [^111jFZne] [^112qcPhA] [^116zSyq8] [^117Xp2Gv] [^117XXkrE] [^1156qyBS].

The most likely causes of mild anemia with borderline thrombocytopenia in a 78-year-old man are **anemia of chronic disease** or **early myelodysplastic syndrome** [^113HMPXu]. Initial workup should include CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, iron studies, B12/folate, TSH, renal and liver function tests, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) [^112qcPhA]. If these are inconclusive, proceed to **bone marrow biopsy** and cytogenetics to evaluate for MDS or other marrow disorders [^113HMPXu]. Additional evaluation for occult GI bleeding [^1156qyBS], hemolysis [^113o4F2T], and medication review [^1113VnmU] is recommended.

## Differential diagnosis

### Anemia

- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Common in elderly patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, malignancies, or chronic infections [^113hDmon].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced erythropoietin production leading to normocytic anemia [^117Xp2Gv].

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Common in elderly, presenting with mild anemia and thrombocytopenia [^113HMPXu].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency can cause mild anemia [^112qcPhA].

- **Occult gastrointestinal bleeding**: Common in elderly, often due to malignancy or peptic ulcer disease [^1156qyBS].

- **Medication-induced anemia**: NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or chemotherapeutic agents [^111aW8pw].

---

### Thrombocytopenia

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Common cause of mild thrombocytopenia in elderly [^113HMPXu].

- **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: Autoimmune destruction of platelets [^111xP5Zj].

- **Medication-induced thrombocytopenia**: Heparin, quinine, antibiotics, antiepileptics [^1113VnmU].

- **Alcohol use**: Chronic alcohol consumption can cause mild thrombocytopenia.

- **Liver disease**: Portal hypertension and splenomegaly causing platelet sequestration.

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

### Initial laboratory evaluation

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and red cell indices**: Evaluate MCV, MCH, RDW [^113HMPXu].

- **Reticulocyte count**: Assess bone marrow response [^113hDmon].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate morphology, dysplasia, blasts, schistocytes [^113HMPXu].

- **Iron studies**: Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, TIBC [^113o4F2T].

- **Vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Rule out nutritional deficiencies [^112RwYCQ].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR [^11529EC7].

- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin [^11426WUb].

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH, free T4 [^113HMPXu].

- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR, CRP [^112qcPhA].

- **Hemolysis markers**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, Coombs test [^113o4F2T].

---

### Additional investigations based on initial results

Consider **bone marrow biopsy** [^113HMPXu] when MDS or marrow infiltration is suspected, and pursue **gastrointestinal evaluation** (fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy, and upper endoscopy) [^1156qyBS] if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected. Imaging with abdominal ultrasound or CT should be considered when organomegaly or malignancy is a concern, and a **medication review** should be performed to identify potential drug-induced cytopenias.

---

## Clinical significance and management considerations

Anemia in the elderly is associated with increased **morbidity, mortality** [^11426WUb], cognitive decline, and functional impairment. Thrombocytopenia increases **bleeding risk**, particularly as platelet counts decline [^111XxjR1]. Management depends on the **underlying cause** and includes treating nutritional deficiencies, managing chronic diseases, discontinuing offending medications, and considering hematology referral if MDS or malignancy is suspected [^113HMPXu].

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem often discovered during routine laboratory tests. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians.

The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary. The evaluation begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include the red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear; further testing is guided by the results of these studies. Treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying cause of the anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consultation in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (e.g. antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important considerations. The depth and duration of anemia are critical to understanding its progression. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation via history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when recent testing has not been performed. These tests include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review. The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities and disorders such as MDS and leukemia.

For this paper, cases reported formally and anecdotally to the authors in their screening and diagnostic roles have been selected to demonstrate areas where errors have occurred and caution should be exercised. The cases demonstrate that it is vital to understand the performance and limitations of the techniques used, along with the phenotypic presentation of cases where haemoglobin variants and/or thalassaemias are coinherited. Those performing result interpretation, delivering services, receiving reports, giving results, and providing counselling should be aware of the complexity of the topic.

### Myleran [^111aW8pw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

It is recommended that evaluation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, total white blood cell count and differential count, and quantitative platelet count be obtained weekly while the patient is on busulfan therapy. In cases where the cause of fluctuation in the formed elements of the peripheral blood is obscure, bone marrow examination may be useful for evaluation of marrow status. A decision to increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue a given dose of busulfan must be based not only on the absolute hematologic values but also on the rapidity with which changes are occurring. The dosage of busulfan may need to be reduced if this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary toxicity is myelosuppression. Occasional patients may be unusually sensitive to busulfan administered at standard dosage and suffer neutropenia or thrombocytopenia following a relatively short exposure to the drug. Busulfan should not be used where facilities for complete blood counts, including quantitative platelet counts, are not available at weekly (or more frequent) intervals.

- **Drug interactions**: Busulfan may cause additive myelosuppression when used with other myelosuppressive drugs. In one study, 12 of approximately 330 patients receiving continuous busulfan and thioguanine therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia were found to have portal hypertension and esophageal varices associated with abnormal liver function tests. Subsequent liver biopsies were performed in 4 of these patients, all of which showed evidence of nodular regenerative hyperplasia.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^112dgQXJ]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly concerning the iron panel, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend evaluating C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes. This evaluation is warranted for individuals presenting with increased serum ferritin levels (> 200 mg/L in females, > 300 mg/L in males), increased transferrin saturation (> 45% in females, > 50% in males), or increased liver iron. These indicators should be assessed, particularly when investigating other causes of hyperferritinemia.

### Not so benign haematology: Anaemia of the elderly [^117KoYiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65 years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking.

Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of anemia in the elective surgical patient [^1172QHmS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of anemia in elective surgical patients may be as frequent as 75% in certain populations. A national audit demonstrated that 35% of patients scheduled for joint replacement therapy have a hemoglobin < 13 g/dL on preadmission testing. Standard practice currently consists of preadmission testing 3 to 7 days before an elective operative procedure, precluding the opportunity to effectively evaluate and manage a patient with unexpected anemia. Therefore, a standardized approach for the detection, evaluation, and management of anemia in the preoperative surgical setting was identified as an unmet medical need. To address this knowledge gap, we convened a panel of physicians to develop a clinical care pathway for anemia management in this setting. Elective surgery patients should receive a hemoglobin (Hgb) determination a minimum of 30 days before the scheduled surgical procedure. Because the identification and evaluation of anemia in this setting will assist in expedited diagnosis and treatment of underlying comorbidities and will improve patient outcomes, unexplained anemia (Hgb < 12 g/dL for females and < 13 g/dL for males) should cause elective surgery to be deferred until an evaluation can be performed.

### Anemia is a new complication in Fabry disease: Data from the Fabry Outcome Survey [^117Ep8Ua]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence and causes of anemia among patients with Fabry disease are unknown.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, we examined hemoglobin concentrations of patients with Fabry disease using a large international database, the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS). We analyzed the association of renal function, heart failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, and inflammation with anemia (defined as hemoglobin levels less than 12 g/dL in women and less than 13 g/dL in men). Impaired renal function was identified with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m². Anemia, heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV], and/or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were documented in 82% of patients. Up to 67% of patients with decreased estimated GFR presented with anemia. There was also a trend for lower hemoglobin levels among patients with signs of inflammation, as defined by an elevated CRP level. We observed no association of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms with anemia. Analyses in 53 patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy for up to 2 years suggest no effect on anemia.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study point to a high prevalence of anemia among patients with Fabry disease, which is, in most instances, related to impaired renal function, heart failure, and inflammation. This finding may be of clinical relevance.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^113Ke5jb]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Prior to the meeting, we sent out a structured survey enquiring about local guidelines for management of severe anaemia, including two specific questions on haemoglobin testing. Most clinicians reported that their guidelines and practice aim to follow WHO guidelines. These guidelines include recommendations that restrict routine transfusion to only those with a haemoglobin less than 40 g/l (haematocrit < 12%) or 40–50 g/l if they have additional signs of severity. Nevertheless, the evidence base for the paediatric guidelines is weak, which has led to confusing recommendations and poor adherence. However, the guidelines offer no specific guidance on clinical or haematological post-admission monitoring of children to identify those who subsequently develop new severity criteria warranting transfusion.

- **Anaemia diagnosis methodologies**: We asked about the most common method used for anaemia diagnosis [POC Hb, haematocrit, or full blood count (haemogram)] and how long it generally took to get a haemoglobin/haematocrit or haemogram result. Most indicated it would take between 1 and 8 hours, and 10% indicated the following day. Haemoglobin testing was only reliably available in just under 40% of those facilities.

- **Recent findings**: A recent publication on transfusion practice in Kenyan hospitals showed that, after adjusting for factors such as severe illness, children who received a transfusion on the same day it was ordered had lower mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38–0.87] than those whose transfusion was delayed (≥ 1 day after prescription).

### Do blood tests cause anemia in hospitalized patients? The effect of diagnostic phlebotomy on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels [^115qDNJG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether phlebotomy contributes to changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in hospitalized general internal medicine patients, a retrospective cohort study was conducted.

The setting was the general internal medicine inpatient service at a tertiary care hospital. The participants included all adult patients discharged from the Toronto General Hospital's internal medicine service between January 1 and June 30, 2001. A total of 989 hospitalizations were reviewed, and 404 hospitalizations were included in the analysis.

- **Measurements and main results**: Mean (SD) hemoglobin and hematocrit changes during hospitalization were 7.9 (12.6) g/L (p < 0.0001) and 2.1% (3.8%) (p < 0.0001), respectively. The mean (SD) volume of phlebotomy during the hospital stay was 74.6 (52.1) mL. On univariate analysis, changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit were predicted by the volume of phlebotomy, length of hospital stay, admission hemoglobin/hematocrit value, age, Charlson comorbidity index, and admission intravascular volume status. The volume of phlebotomy remained a strong predictor of the drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit after adjusting for other predictors using multivariate analysis (p < 0.0001). On average, every 100 mL of phlebotomy was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.0 g/L and 1.9%, respectively.

Phlebotomy is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for patients admitted to an internal medicine service and can contribute to anemia. This anemia, in turn, may have significant consequences, especially for patients with cardiorespiratory disease.

### Emergency transfusions [^117HPxgJ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Successful emergency transfusions require early recognition and activation of resources to minimize treatment delays. The initial goals should focus on the replacement of blood in a balanced fashion. There is an ongoing debate regarding the best approach to transfusions, with some advocating for resuscitation with a fixed ratio of blood products and others preferring to use viscoelastic assays to guide transfusions. Whole-blood transfusion is also a debated strategy. Despite these different approaches, it is generally accepted that transfusions should be started early and crystalloid infusions limited. As hemodynamic stability is restored, endpoints of resuscitation should be used to guide the resuscitation.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: What is it? Why is it important [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates a disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count.

For a long time, cutoff values for correcting the white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections. The reasons for this require further elucidation.

In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Approach to interpreting common laboratory pathology tests in transgender individuals [^116RdCYN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Androgens are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, while the impact of estrogens is not as well understood. In transgender individuals who have been on established and full-dose feminizing hormone therapy (estradiol and anti-androgen) for at least 6 months, there is a significant decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the female reference range. Conversely, after 6 months of masculinizing testosterone therapy, trans people demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the male reference range. Serum hematocrit in the range of the affirmed gender is evident from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

Of note, there are association studies suggesting higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, which is probably a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy more so than those using feminizing hormone therapy. As smoking may additionally increase hematocrit, smoking cessation should be emphasized in those with elevated hematocrit. While the long-term cardiovascular implications of using a different reference range for hemoglobin or hematocrit are unclear in general, reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be used. Female reference ranges should be used for someone taking gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy, and male reference ranges should be used for people using masculinizing hormone therapy.

In trans women, there is a small statistically significant but clinically insignificant rise in platelet count, which remains within the normal reference range.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, which they often are not, the physician must make their decision based on the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC, particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history, and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Monitoring of hematological and hemostatic parameters in neurocritical care patients [^114Y4AhS]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia and bleeding are paramount concerns in neurocritical care and often relate to the severity of intracranial hemorrhage. Anemia is generally associated with worse outcomes, and efforts to minimize anemia through reduced volume of blood sampled are encouraged. Point-of-care testing reliably detects the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen bleeding and reduce platelet activity, particularly in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. How best to monitor the effect of platelet transfusion or platelet-activating therapy is not well studied. For patients known to take novel oral anticoagulants, drug-specific coagulation tests before neurosurgical intervention are prudent.

### Association of hemoglobin concentration and its change with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [^114UVoVt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Several potential mechanisms could explain how low hemoglobin concentrations increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐related and all‐cause mortality. Anemic status may result in ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Chronic anemia with hemoglobin levels of 16.0 g/dL or more had a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and all‐cause mortality compared to smokers with normal hemoglobin concentrations of 13.0 g/dL.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^114JCsrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed based on hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit.

- **Minimum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels**: The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV, and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of pure IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate ID, as the presence of ACD can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

	- **Iron stores**: Serum ferritin
	- **Iron transport**: Transferrin saturation
	- **Iron utilization**: Erythropoiesis, i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be…

### Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis in childhood [^115Wnv3A]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Investigations**: Complete blood count on admission was suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia. Key findings include:
	- **Haemoglobin**: 40 g/L.
	- Total red blood cell count: 2.57 × 10¹²/L (normal range: 4–5.2 × 10¹²/L).
	- Haematocrit: 16.3% (normal range: 35–45%).

	- **Red blood cell indices**:
		- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 63.4 fL (normal range: 77–95).
		- Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH): 15.6 pg (normal range: 25–33).
		- Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC): 24.5 gm/dL (normal range: 31–37).
		- Red cell distribution width (RDW): 47.6 fL (normal range: 11.6–14).

	- **Total leucocyte count**: 14.27 × 10⁹/L
	- **Differential leucocyte count**:
		- **Neutrophil**: 65.8%.
		- **Lymphocyte**: 26.5%.
		- **Eosinophil**: 0.8%.
		- **Monocyte**: 5.8%.
		- **Basophil**: 1.1%.

Interpretation indicates a complete blood count with elevated RDW and decreased MCV, MCH, and MCHC, suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia. Urine routine examination was within normal limits. Peripheral smear examination revealed red blood cells exhibiting severe anisopoikilocytosis, with frequent microcytes and hypochromic cells observed. Leptocytes were frequent.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in Black and Mexican-American women. Among patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia, 9 percent are found to have a gastrointestinal cancer upon evaluation. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is advised for high-risk infants aged six to 12 months.

Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning.

- **Initial diagnostic test**: Serum ferritin is the preferred test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng/mL (46 and 99 mcg/L). In such cases, a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

- **Approach in children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age**: A trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative. Hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is no 1 to 2 g/dL (10 to 20 g/L) increase in hemoglobin level, potential issues include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or an unknown lesion.

For other patients, particularly those older than 50, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended, starting with a colonoscopy.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116HQZLa]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 4.1–4.5) outlines specific recommendations for the management of haemoglobin (Hb) levels during erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy.

- **Monitoring of treatment – Hb during ESA therapy**: We suggest that Hb concentration should be monitored every 2–4 weeks during the correction phase and every 1–3 months for stable patients in the maintenance phase. More frequent monitoring will depend on clinical circumstances.

The rationale highlights the importance of closely monitoring Hb response to treatment to preempt adverse events and plan ESA dose modification. More frequent Hb monitoring may be necessitated for patients with unstable Hb, out-of-target Hb levels, or anticipated Hb drops due to blood loss, haemolysis, infection, or suboptimal dialysis.

The response to ESA therapy varies widely among different patient groups and individuals within those groups. Additionally, an individual's response may vary significantly depending on other clinical variables. During ESA initiation therapy, after drug dose adjustments, or changes in an individual's clinical condition, more frequent monitoring is advised to avoid under-treatment (ongoing anaemia) and overtreatment (rapidly rising Hb, hypertension, or polycythaemia).

### How i manage autoimmune cytopenias in patients with lymphoid cancer [^111xP5Zj]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in September 2012. At this time, he had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 41 × 10⁹/L. The patient was in good condition with a hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL. However, a platelet count of 38 × 10⁹/L indicated thrombocytopenia, albeit without symptoms of bleeding. The discrepancy between the almost normal hemoglobin level and the low platelet count led to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnostics. No platelet-specific antibodies were detected, but reticulated thrombocytes were elevated at 30.24% (normal values are 2% to 9%). Thrombopoietin levels were within the normal range at 285 pg/mL (normal is > 150 pg/mL). These results, while not diagnostic, were consistent with increased platelet destruction. No anti-platelet antibodies were detected in the peripheral blood.

A bone marrow biopsy specimen indicated nodular infiltration with CLL cells (20%), with normal-to-elevated thrombopoiesis compatible with CLL and ITP. According to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Guidelines, the patient was not treated for CLL in the absence of symptoms. The patient received 1 mg/kg of prednisolone for 3 days in preparation for surgery, resulting in an increase in the platelet count to 101 × 10⁹/L.

Two years later, the patient experienced an episode of severe gastrointestinal bleeding. The platelet count was 20 × 10⁹/L, with a WBC count of 66 × 10⁹/L. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed at this time due to the patient's preference. Consequently, the patient underwent treatment with six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (rituximab 375 mg/m²; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m²; dexamethasone 12 mg).

### Intractable anemia among hemodialysis patients: A sign of suboptimal management or a marker of disease [^115XMJbk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Most incident hemodialysis (HD) patients who initiate dialysis therapy with anemia can usually achieve a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11 g/dL or greater (≥ 110 g/L) within a few months of the initiation of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. However, patients unable to achieve this level may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes. Whether intractable anemia is a modifiable problem or a marker for other conditions remains unclear. This question was addressed in a cohort of 130,544 incident HD patients from 1996 to 2000 who were administered EPO regularly.

- **Methods**: Medicare claims data were used to determine demographic characteristics, comorbidities, hospitalizations, and related events. Patients who did not achieve an Hb level of 11 g/dL or greater (≥ 110 g/L; n = 19,096; 14.6%) during months 4 to 9 after dialysis therapy initiation were compared with those who did.

- **Results**: Patients unable to achieve an Hb level of 11 g/dL (110 g/L) were younger and more often of nonwhite race. Additionally, these patients had more comorbid conditions; experienced more hospitalizations with longer stays, more infectious hospitalizations, and more catheter insertions; and were administered more blood transfusions. EPO was administered in higher and increasing doses during the years of study among patients with intractable anemia compared with those with an Hb level of 11 g/dL or greater (≥ 110 g/L), likely denoting increasing attempts to correct anemia over the years.

- **Conclusion**: It is apparent that incident HD patients unable to achieve an Hb level of 11 g/dL.

### Inrebic [^1113VnmU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment with INREBIC can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.

- **Anemia**: New or worsening Grade 3 anemia occurred in 34% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 anemia was approximately 2 months, with 75% of cases occurring within 3 months. Mean hemoglobin levels reached nadir after 12 to 16 weeks, with partial recovery and stabilization after 16 weeks. Red blood cell transfusions were received by 51% of INREBIC-treated patients, and permanent discontinuation of INREBIC occurred due to anemia in 1% of patients. Consider dose reduction for patients who become red blood cell transfusion dependent [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: New or worsening Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia during the randomized treatment period occurred in 12% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was approximately 1 month, with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Platelet transfusions were received by 3.1% of INREBIC-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation of treatment due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding that required clinical intervention both occurred in 2.1% of INREBIC-treated patients.

Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, interrupt INREBIC until resolved to less than or equal to Grade 2 or baseline. Restart the dose at 100 mg daily below the last given dose and monitor platelets as clinically indicated.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: Implications for anemia [^1159rLSu]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

In practice, clinicians generally consider anemia (circulating hemoglobin concentration < 120 g/L in non-pregnant females and < 130 g/L in males) as due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis or increased erythrocyte loss or destruction. Rarely is a rise in plasma volume relative to circulating total hemoglobin mass considered as a cause. But does this matter? We explored this issue in patients, measuring hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass (optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method) and thereby calculating plasma volume in healthy volunteers, surgical patients, and those with inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease, or heart failure.

We studied 109 participants. Hemoglobin mass correlated well with its concentration in the healthy, surgical, and inflammatory bowel disease groups (r = 0.687–0.871, P < 0.001). However, they were poorly related in liver disease (r = 0.410, P = 0.11) and heart failure patients (r = 0.312, P = 0.16). Here, hemoglobin mass explained little of the variance in its concentration (adjusted R² = 0.109 and 0.052; P = 0.11 and 0.16), whilst plasma volume did (R² change 0.724 and 0.805 in heart and liver disease respectively, P < 0.0001).

Exemplar patients with identical (normal or raised) total hemoglobin masses were diagnosed as profoundly anemic (or not) depending on differences in plasma volume that had not been measured or even considered as a cause. The traditional inference that anemia generally reflects hemoglobin deficiency may be misleading, potentially resulting in inappropriate tests and therapeutic interventions.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LZUAq]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Monitoring of treatment - resistance to ESA therapy**: We recommend that inadequate response ('resistance') to ESA therapy is defined as failure to reach the target Hb level despite SC epoetin dose > 300 IU/kg/week (450 IU/kg/week IV epoetin), or darbepoetin dose > 1.5 microgram/kg/week. Hyporesponsive patients who are iron replete should be screened clinically and by investigations for other common causes of anaemia.

- **Audit measure**: Prevalence of resistance to ESA among renal replacement therapy patients.

- **Rationale**: Extensive publications are available on the topic of resistance to ESA therapy, including the Revised European Best Practice Guidelines which defines ESA resistance as above. Failure to respond at an earlier stage in therapy should, however, raise suspicion of ESA resistance.

Comparison of the individual Hb outcome achieved and the dose of ESA used can provide a useful way of highlighting individuals that are ESA resistant during local unit audit. ESA therapy is efficacious in most patients. However, many conditions and treatment variables can cause or explain apparent resistance to ESA therapy. Adequate investigation and management of these underlying conditions are crucial in achieving satisfactory outcome haemoglobin values, as well as requiring therapy in their own right.

- **Evaluation for ESA induced pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)**:
	- We do not recommend routine screening for anti-erythropoietin antibodies among CKD patients regularly treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (2A).
	- We recommend that the diagnosis of ESA induc

### Atypical SARS in geriatric patient [^112qHgx7]. Emerging infectious diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Investigations on admission showed that the patient's hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL, the leukocyte count was 7,200/mm³ (86.3% polymorphs, 8.6% lymphocytes), and the platelet count was 304,000/mm³. The serum urea was 6.6 mmol/L; serum potassium, 5.0 mmol/L; serum sodium, 138 mmol/L; and creatinine, 79 μmol/L. The liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 10.6 μmol/L; serum albumin, 30 g/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 106 μ/L; serum alanine transaminase, 16 μ/L; and serum aspartate transaminase, 33 μ/L. Her creatine kinase was 45 μ/L, and C-reactive protein was elevated at 147.0 mg/L.

The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole were prescribed. Her chest radiograph showed infiltrates in the right lower zone. Urine, sputum, and blood cultures did not yield any bacterial growth. Serologic testing for Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia, as well as nasopharyngeal aspirate for common viral antigens, were not performed due to low clinical suspicion. She was subsequently transferred to the geriatric unit. Her condition improved, and she was placed in the general ward on March 28. No protective equipment was used by staff attending to her in the general ward. It was ascertained that she was previously admitted to a non-SARS ward in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

However, on March 29, the patient became restless and more breathless. A repeat chest radiograph confirmed congestive cardiac failure. Her repeat leukocyte count was 8,800/mm³ (93.0% polymorphs, 4.5% lymphocytes), and the platelet count was 167,000/mm³. There was mild hyponatremia.

### Identification of data-driven preoperative hemoglobin strata that predict the likelihood of blood transfusion and the risk of major complications and prosthetic joint infection after total hip arthroplasty [^1124ik2z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for complications after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Currently used hemoglobin thresholds are not developed for risk stratification of arthroplasty patients and do not provide surgery-specific information on postoperative complication risk. Thus, we aimed to calculate THA-specific preoperative hemoglobin strata that observe the likelihood of 90-day blood transfusion and determine whether these strata are associated with increased risk of 90-day complications and 2-year prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort analysis identified 56,101 patients who underwent primary THA from 2013 to 2022. Using the lowest hemoglobin value for each patient one month before THA, stratum-specific likelihood ratio (SSLR) analysis calculated sex-based hemoglobin strata associated with the likelihood of 90-day postoperative blood transfusion. Propensity score matching was performed. Incidence rates and risk of 90-day major complications and 2-year PJI were observed for each identified preoperative hemoglobin stratum.

- **Results**: SSLR analysis identified five male strata (likelihood ratio: < 10.4 g/dL, 12.5; 10.5 to 11.4 g/dL, 8.0; 11.5 to 12.4 g/dL, 2.4; 12.5 to 13.4 g/dL, 1.3; 13.5 to 13.9 g/dL, 0.5) and five female strata (< 8.9 g/dL, 10.7; 9.0 to 10.9 g/dL, 4.0; 11.0 to 11.4 g/dL, 2.0; 12.0 to 12.9 g/dL, 1.0; 13.0 to 13.4 g/dL, 0.6) preoperative hemoglobin strata associated with varying likelihoods of 90-day blood transfusion after THA. After matching in both male and female cohorts, as the calculated preoperative hemoglobin strata increase, the likelihood of postoperative complications diminishes.

### Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: Improvement with blood glucose control [^116bKycw]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients, we undertook a retrospective review of medical records of patients with new-onset diabetes and unexplained anemia. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study.

In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 ± 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 ± 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 ± 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 ± 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 ± 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 ± 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 ± 1.7% (P < 0.001; confidence interval, 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 ± 0.9 g/dL (P < 0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 ± 1.9% (P < 0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: A neglected essential diagnostic test [^114FxChk]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

To update guidelines with the new findings from the TRACT trial, a consensus severe anaemia management algorithm was developed to improve evidence-based clinical practice and avert the unnecessary use of transfusion in children with uncomplicated severe anaemia. Two vital components of the transfusion management algorithm included both clinical and Hb monitoring. Using data from the TRACT trial, we demonstrated that a minimum of three additional measurements of Hb over 48 hours of hospital stay could identify approximately 50% of cases developing severe and complicated anaemia. This was significant since 76% of children required a transfusion following a drop in Hb to less than 40 g/l. From this watch-and-wait policy, there was no evidence of short- or long-term adverse events such as morbidity and mortality. The major concern raised at the meeting was that future evidence-based practice would require the provision of POC Hb testing — something that most hospitals currently do not have.

- **Quantitative image analysis**: Region of interest (ROI)-based quantitative image analysis was conducted in contrast-enhanced conventional images by a radiologist with 1 year of experience in thoracic imaging. Two ROIs were placed in the left ventricle and one ROI was placed in the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the left ventricle (Fig. 2). ROIs were drawn as large as possible with a minimum diameter of 1 cm; however, the inclusion of surrounding tissues was avoided. ROIs were then copied and pasted onto VNC reconstructions. For each ROI, attenuation and standard deviation (SD) were recorded, and all three ROIs were averaged for statistical testing.

	- Fig. 2 shows the placement of circular regions of interest in the left ventricle and the descending aorta in a 42-year-old anemic male patient (serum hemoglobin 5.6 g/dl; upper row) and in a 59-year-old healthy male patient (serum hemoglobin 14.5 g/dl; lower row) in contrast-enhanced portal venous phase scans (left) and the corresponding virtual non-contrast reconstructions (right). Of note, the "interventricular septum sign" is slightly visible in the virtual non-contrast reconstruction in the upper row.

- **Serum hemoglobin**: For each patient, HbS levels were retrieved from the hospital information system. Only laboratory tests within ± 7 days of the SDCT exam were included. Three groups — healthy, mild/moderate anemia, and severe anemia — were defined according to the following HbS concentrations as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines: male patients with HbS ≥ 13.0 g/dl and female patients with HbS ≥ 12.0 g/dl were included.

### Is there a role for the use of IFN-α in primary myelofibrosis [^115WmPxN]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension is referred to your hematology clinic for an incidental discovery of anemia. He does not have any constitutional symptoms, and previous blood counts have been within the normal range. He exhibits hepatosplenomegaly with a palpable spleen extending 6 cm below the left costal margin and a liver size of 2.5 cm below the right costal margin.

Laboratory evaluation shows a WBC count of 12.8 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelets of 202 K/μL, with a mean corpuscular volume of 85.7. The differential count includes 72% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 5% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 1% promyelocytes, and 4% myelocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase is elevated at 447 U/L, where the upper limit of normal is < 340 U/L. The peripheral blood smear reveals 2+ teardrop-shaped RBCs, large hypogranular platelets, and rare nucleated RBCs.

Bone marrow biopsy shows a hypercellular BM with atypical megakaryocytes and increased reticulin fibrosis (MF-1). BCR-ABL gene rearrangement by FISH returns negative, while the JAK2 V617F mutation is 95% positive. The patient is diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis, considered low risk (risk score of 0) by the International Prognostic Scoring System. Because he is low risk and asymptomatic, he does not require treatment at this time. However, he has learned about the possible clinical benefits of IFN-α, including potential reduction of BM fibrosis, and wonders whether this would be an appropriate treatment.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116Tii6A]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting ESA doses when hemoglobin levels are ≤ 105 g/L or ≥ 115 g/L in adults, young patients, and children aged ≥ 2 years. It is advised to aim for a population distribution centered on a mean of 110 g/L, with an intervention threshold range of 100–120 g/L.

### Delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with travel-associated severe malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013 [^115EKWzf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Severe malaria was defined as malaria in persons with blood smears positive for asexual forms of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites and at least one criterion of severity according to the definition of severe malaria used in France. Patients with mixed-species infections were excluded from analysis.

Anemia was defined as a blood hemoglobin level of 390 IU/L (reference value: 190–390 IU/L), or both. We defined three patterns of anemia as previously described: PADH, non-PADH, and indeterminate. The PADH pattern was defined by: 1) a new drop in the hemoglobin level after day 8 of treatment initiation and the appearance or reappearance of hemolytic markers (> 10% drop in hemoglobin or > 10% rise in LDH levels) occurring any time between day 8 and the end of follow-up, and/or 2) by any information in the medical chart referring to acute hemolysis occurring after day 8. The non-PADH pattern was defined by a hemoglobin nadir and a hemolysis peak occurring before day 8, with or without positive markers of hemolysis after day 8, and without a nadir or sudden drop of hemoglobin after day 8 as defined for the PADH pattern. The indeterminate pattern was defined as all other cases of anemia for which information was lacking or with an evolution pattern that did not fit the other patterns.

### Identification and basic management of bleeding disorders in adults [^111XxjR1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Adults with bleeding disorders may present to their family physician with minor bleeding symptoms or hematologic laboratory abnormalities discovered during evaluation for surgery or another purpose. Identifying the small proportion of adults who have an underlying bleeding disorder as the cause for such signs or symptoms may be challenging.

In cases of asymptomatic hematologic laboratory abnormalities, the particular abnormality should narrow down the potentially affected hemostatic component(s), ideally streamlining subsequent investigation. In patients presenting with bleeding symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination are critical for first identifying bleeding as pathologic, then performing the appropriate diagnostic evaluation after excluding identifiable causes.

Knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes contributing to impaired hemostasis in any given bleeding disorder ensures proper treatment and avoids therapies that are unnecessary or even contraindicated. Management is further determined by bleeding phenotype and, for invasive procedures, the anticipated risk for bleeding. Consultation with a hematologist may facilitate proper evaluation and treatment, particularly in adults with rare bleeding disorders or no identifiable cause for bleeding.

This article reviews the diagnostic approach to hematologic laboratory abnormalities and abnormal bleeding in adults, as well as basic preventive care and hemostatic management of adults with bleeding disorders.

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: A measured response to a critical review [^1175zjQv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

In a systematic evaluation of 450 studies and 494 clinical scenarios, investigators reported that "decisions to transfuse RBCs are often based on unsubstantiated Hb level or hematocrit 'triggers'". The authors concluded that 59% of transfusions actually reduced "well-being", defined as the health of the transfusion recipient, and therefore were considered inappropriate; 29% had no benefit.

Clinicians are even less aware of the costs of blood transfusions than the potential risks. Although the acquisition cost of a unit of blood varies between $200 and $250 in most hospitals, activity-based costing that considers all of the other costs associated with administering blood reveals a total cost between $522 and $1,183 per unit, and probably more when adjusted for inflation and other factors.

Given the risks and costs of RBC transfusions, there is a growing recognition of the need for strategies to reduce unnecessary transfusions. The American Medical Association's Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement and the Joint Commission, with the participation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently identified RBC transfusions as one of the top five overused procedures in medicine. The Joint Commission has also introduced measures that track the appropriateness of RBC transfusion as a continuous quality indicator.

### Seroquel XR [^112Kjob6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Decreased hemoglobin in adults was observed in short-term, placebo-controlled trials. A decrease in hemoglobin to ≤ 13 g/dL for males and ≤ 12 g/dL for females occurred on at least one occasion in 8.3% (594/7155) of quetiapine-treated patients compared to 6.2% (219/3536) of those treated with placebo. In a larger database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 11% (2277/20729) of quetiapine-treated patients experienced decreased hemoglobin to similar levels.

- **Interference with urine drug screens**: Literature reports have suggested false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution is advised when interpreting positive urine drug screen results for these substances, and confirmation through an alternative analytical technique, such as chromatographic methods, should be considered.

- **ECG changes**:
	- **In adults**: 2.5% of Seroquel XR patients and 2.3% of placebo patients experienced tachycardia (> 120 bpm) at any time during the trials. Seroquel XR was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, as assessed by ECG, of 6.3 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 0.4 beats per minute for placebo. This aligns with the rates for Seroquel in general. The incidence of adverse reactions related to tachycardia was 1.9% for Seroquel XR compared to 0.5% for placebo. Seroquel use resulted in a mean heart rate increase, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute, compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute in placebo patients.

### The epidemiology of hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116wzcnP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes, for whom it constitutes an additional burden. The aim of this study is to clarify the natural history of anemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and describe factors that predict a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels.

- **Methods**: A 5-year prospective cohort study was designed as a follow-up of 503 individuals with type 2 diabetes in a single diabetes clinic. In addition to standard management, a full blood count was obtained at each routine visit. No intervention was undertaken to modify Hb levels.

- **Results**: At baseline, 12% of patients had anemia, and an additional 13% developed anemia during follow-up. Overall Hb levels decreased by -0.07 ± 0.01 g/dL/y, suggesting that anemia is the end point of a process that begins more than 10 years previously with the initiation of vascular damage. The greatest decreases in Hb levels were seen in patients with macroalbuminuria, renal impairment, or established macrovascular disease at baseline (P 1.5 mL/s) or normoalbuminuria had stable Hb levels during the 5-year follow-up. In patients with anemia in our cohort who were managed conservatively, Hb levels decreased by 0.09 ± 0.03 g/dL/y. This decrease was associated with HbA1c levels, but not renal function.

- **Conclusion**: This study defines the natural history of Hb levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm [^114xBFdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Children in the no immediate transfusion category were monitored clinically according to the algorithm. They received a hemoglobin (Hb) test at 8, 24, and 48 hours and were not transfused unless they developed severity signs or Hb fell below 40 g/l. In the TRACT trial, 386 out of 787 children (49%) randomized to not receive an immediate transfusion eventually did receive one. Details of the timing of triggered transfusions are available in Figures 1 and 4A. Haemodilution caused by liberal use of intravenous fluids was discounted based on the fact that no fluid boluses were given, and children only received maintenance fluids until they were able to drink.

Children randomized to immediate transfusion received blood at a median [interquartile range (IQR)] of 1.3 [0.9–1.7] hours after randomization. In contrast, among those in the deferred group, 295 out of 386 (76%) received a subsequent transfusion, mainly triggered by a fall in Hb to below 40 g/l, at a median (IQR) of 24.9 (9.2–49.8) hours after randomization. Additional reasons for transfusion in 57 children (15%) included the development of clinical severity features such as impaired consciousness or increased work of breathing and sickle cell disease (SCD) identified in hospital (n = 7; 2%). Only 27 children (7%) received a transfusion without a very low Hb or recorded severity feature, mainly after 48 hours, when reasons for transfusion were not routinely captured.

Notably, the timing of triggered transfusions largely coincided with routine Hb assessments conducted at 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours after randomization.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: Implications for anemia [^113VvGk4]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

- **Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit**: In all patients, these parameters were categorized by plasma volume status. Plasma volume (PV) contraction, observed in three patients, was classified as greater than minus 8% from expected norms. Normal PV, observed in 24 patients, was defined as derived PV within ± 8% of the expected normal volume on an individual level. Mild to moderate volume expansion, noted in 36 patients, was considered as 8% to 25% above the expected normal volume.

	* A significant difference was observed in hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) between different PV statuses: *P✱ = 0.005 for severe PV expansion versus mild to moderate, † *P* < 0.0001 for severe PV expansion versus normal PV. Data are expressed as mean (± standard deviation error bars).

- **Abbreviations**: PV stands for plasma volume; [Hb] indicates hemoglobin concentration (g.L −1); Hct represents hematocrit percentage.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112RwYCQ]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in relation to indications for screening in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia workup. This workup should include at least red blood cell (RBC) indices, such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, in patients with low hemoglobin levels. Additionally, serum vitamin B12 measurement should be included in a more extensive workup.

### A 34-year-old man with a neck mass [^113rJb7H]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratory and radiology findings were as follows: Hemoglobin was 13.6 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count was 5,400/μL, platelets were 320,000/μL, and CD4 count was 594 cells/μL. Creatinine level was recorded at 1.0 mg/dL. The serum venereal disease research laboratory test returned negative results. Blood culture and erythrocyte sedimentation rate tests, although available at the hospital, were not requested. Additional blood tests, including C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, and Epstein Barr virus viral load, were not available. Moreover, the patient was unable to afford to have these tests performed at an external facility.

The results of the ECG were normal. A Doppler ultrasound scan of the right neck mass revealed a 6 cm × 6 cm pseudoaneurysm with a clot in the lumen. A chest radiograph displayed a left paratracheal mass in the superior mediastinum, causing tracheal deviation to the right. The lung fields appeared normal, and no additional chest pathologies were observed on the radiograph (Fig 1).

A non-contrast MRI scan of the neck and upper thorax identified three large pseudoaneurysms. One was a right common carotid artery pseudoaneurysm, measuring 6 cm in diameter, with an extensive mural thrombus. Furthermore, there were two intrathoracic pseudoaneurysms: a superior one, 6 cm wide, encircling the proximal left subclavian artery, and an inferior one, 4 cm wide, at the origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig 2).

### Blood hemoglobin concentrations and the incidence of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease in patients undergoing hemodialysis: 10-year outcomes of the Q-Cohort Study [^112oKmWn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Some potential mechanisms may explain the association between anemia and PAD progression. One such mechanism may be that anemia often leads to hyperdynamic circulation, which modulates the inflammatory response to diseased arteries. Another mechanism may be that anemia results in less oxygen delivery to tissues, causing hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions, leading to the promotion of PAD. Indeed, basic studies have shown that inflammasome activation is observed in the diseased arteries of patients with PAD. Further experimental studies are warranted to reveal the pathological role of anemia in PAD progression.

The optimal target range of blood hemoglobin concentration in patients receiving hemodialysis has been debated. Anemia correction by ESAs or other therapeutic options significantly decreases the incidence of blood transfusion, improves patients' quality of life, and increases physical vitality by increasing blood supply capacity. Experimental studies have confirmed that anemia correction by ESAs has diverse protective effects on clinically important outcomes. However, regarding hard endpoints, large-scale trials comparing two targets of low and high blood hemoglobin concentrations failed to show the superiority of targeting a high blood hemoglobin concentration among patients receiving hemodialysis. Instead, some randomized controlled trials showed that targeting a high blood hemoglobin concentration was associated with worse outcomes among non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD. A high dose of ESAs, medical conditions causing ES…

### Anemia in type 2 diabetic patients and correlation with kidney function in a tertiary care sub-Saharan African hospital: A cross-sectional study [^115DpqQf]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were 13.2 ± 2.0 g/dl in males and 12.3 ± 1.5 g/dl in females (p < 0.001). According to the WHO criteria, 263 patients (41.4%) had anemia. The prevalence was 42.6% in females (n = 127) and 40.2% in males (n = 136). Using the threshold recommended for intervention (Hb < 11 g/dl for both sexes), 91 patients (14.3%), including 48 females (prevalence 16.1%) and 43 males (prevalence 12.7%), had anemia.

The average mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the total population was 86.3 ± 7.7 fl. The difference in the distribution of mean corpuscular volume categories between patients with anemia and those without anemia was significant (p < 0.001), with anemic patients having more microcytosis and macrocytosis than non-anemic patients. The average mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was 32.4 ± 2.7 in the total population. Low MCHC was more common in anemic than non-anemic participants, 103 (47.3%) and 100 (38.3%) respectively (p = 0.05).

- **Anemia definition**: Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin concentration of < 12 g/dl for females and < 13 g/dl for males.

### Abnormally low hemoglobin A1c as harbinger of hemoglobinopathy [^116c43SF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c is frequently used in primary care to screen for and monitor disorders of glucose metabolism. A number of clinical syndromes may impact the accuracy of this laboratory value. This report describes a case of abnormally low hemoglobin A1c that was the result of an asymptomatic compound hemoglobinopathy (homozygous hemoglobin S disease and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) that had gone previously undiagnosed. Primary care physicians must be aware of such pitfalls in the use of this laboratory value and be prepared to use other values to monitor for and assess disorders of glucose metabolism.

### Preoperative anemia-screening clinics [^115qzz8p]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as an increased risk of perioperative transfusion. It is an important and modifiable risk factor for surgical patients. For high-blood-loss surgeries, preoperative anemia is defined as hemoglobin levels below 13 g/dL for both male and female patients. Preoperative anemia is common, with prevalence ranging from 25% to 40% in large observational studies.

The most common treatable cause of preoperative anemia is iron-deficiency anemia; initial laboratory tests should focus on diagnosing this condition. Management includes iron supplementation with intravenous iron therapy when oral iron is ineffective, not tolerated, when anemia is severe, or when there is insufficient time to surgery (less than four weeks). In other situations, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may be considered, particularly for patients with multiple alloantibodies or religious objections to transfusion.

Establishing preoperative anemia-screening clinics is essential to facilitate the diagnosis and management of preoperative anemia. The goals of managing preoperative anemia include treating the anemia, reducing the need for transfusion, and improving patient outcomes.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 standard deviations below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive.

In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination, combined with appropriate laboratory test results, can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. This article aims to aid physicians attending to children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to pediatric and adult hematology practices. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases will be acquired, especially in adult patients, but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step — defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up — can be as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low?

Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as an introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally, the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. Additionally, we provide guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### An 8-year-old boy with fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia [^111rjk1j]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with 5 days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED) out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination revealed marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia, as well as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania 10 months before admission.

The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and was evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multiorgan involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.
