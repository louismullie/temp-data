## Question

high methylmalonic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what is the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) in the context of high methylmalonic acid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology and genetic causes that would anchor a "most specific" test. Then, I should verify the role and limitations of biochemical tests versus molecular confirmation. Next, I will examine guideline and high-credibility sources for how "specificity" is framed in MMA diagnostics. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions (e.g., biochemical gold standard for detection versus molecular gold standard for specificity) and state the conclusion clearly.

> Let me think about the disease mechanism first, because the "most specific" confirmatory test should ideally detect the causal defect directly; MMA is classically due to deficiency of methylmalonyl‑CoA mutase (MMUT) or defects in intracellular cobalamin metabolism (MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC), leading to pathognomonic metabolite accumulation such as methylmalonic acid and C3 acylcarnitine, but the root cause is genetic and sits in MMUT or cobalamin-processing genes, which sets up molecular testing as inherently most specific for defining etiology [^1124vKHx] [^113nBd9N] [^113uUfVH].

> Wait, let me verify the role of biochemical assays; urine organic acids by GC‑MS (showing elevated methylmalonic acid and often 2‑methylcitrate) is indeed the standard way to confirm a biochemical diagnosis after clinical suspicion or newborn screening, but elevations can also occur in non-genetic contexts such as cobalamin deficiency and renal dysfunction, so while sensitive for MMA biochemistry, this is not the most specific test for the genetic disorder itself, which is the crux of the question [^114iAGqi] [^114rbYbd] [^115wscRB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; at first glance one might call urine organic acids the "gold standard" for initial diagnostic confirmation, but "most specific" demands identification of the precise molecular defect, and that is accomplished by genetic testing that detects pathogenic variants in MMUT or cobalamin-pathway genes, enabling subtype assignment and B12-responsiveness predictions, which biochemical profiles alone cannot provide with certainty [^117PbmqU] [^113uUfVH] [^111HppbB].

> I should confirm the strength of molecular testing here; multiple clinical reports and guideline statements emphasize that genotyping is necessary to confirm etiology, distinguish isolated MMA (MMUT, MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC variant 2) from combined forms, stratify mut0 versus mut−, and inform prognosis and therapy, which collectively defines it as the most specific confirmatory modality for MMA as a genetic disease [^116Rodbc] [^113uUfVH] [^113nBd9N].

> Next, I should review the distractors; skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence are dermatologic tools used for other conditions and are neither diagnostic nor specific for MMA, and even in the dermatology case scenario underpinning this question, these were explicitly labeled as incorrect approaches for confirming MMA, reinforcing that we should not be swayed by cutaneous presentations in an inborn error of metabolism context [^115mPmHw].

> But wait, what if limiting testing to the MUT gene misses cobalamin-metabolism defects; that is a fair concern, so let me reconsider and clarify the nuance: the most specific confirmatory approach is molecular genetic testing of the causal genes, ideally via a targeted panel or exome that includes MMUT, MMAA, MMAB, and MMADHC, yet when constrained to the offered choices, "genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation" represents the best available option pointing to definitive molecular confirmation, even if in practice I would expand beyond MUT alone to capture all etiologies [^113uUfVH] [^113nBd9N] [^1124vKHx].

> I need to ensure I address the biochemical option properly; dosage of urine organic acids is indispensable for initial detection and remains central to longitudinal monitoring, but its specificity is reduced by non-genetic causes of MMA elevation and its inability to determine the genotype or predict cobalamin responsiveness, which is why it is edged out by molecular testing when the question is framed around "most specific test to confirm" [^114iAGqi] [^114rbYbd] [^115wscRB].

> I will now examine how newborn screening integrates into this; acylcarnitine C3 and C3/C2 identify at-risk neonates, and second-tier DNA improves specificity, which again underscores that genetic analysis is the confirmatory step that best refines false positives and defines the exact disorder, whereas metabolites alone are variable and influenced by diet and renal function [^115UMu8H] [^1175FXAa].

> Final answer, after double-checking the hierarchy of evidence and the wording of the options: C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation; this is the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis of MMA among the provided choices because it directly identifies the pathogenic variant causing the enzymatic deficiency and enables precise subtype classification and management planning [^117PbmqU] [^113uUfVH] [^111HppbB].

High methylmalonic acid (MMA) most often indicates **vitamin B12 deficiency** [^114rbYbd] or **inherited forms of MMA** (MMUT or cobalamin pathway defects) [^1148WRCV] but can also result from renal impairment [^114rbYbd], metformin [^114Loki3], nitrous oxide, or small-bowel bacterial overgrowth [^115MpXif]. Clinically, elevated MMA suggests **B12 deficiency, inherited MMA, or renal dysfunction** [^114rbYbd] and is confirmed by plasma or urine MMA alongside B12, homocysteine [^115wscRB], and renal function tests; genetic testing defines MMA subtypes [^1148WRCV] [^113nBd9N]. Management targets the cause: **B12 replacement** [^116kWjba]; **dietary protein restriction, carnitine, and metronidazole** for MMA; and **transplant or emerging gene/mRNA therapies** for severe cases [^114wBNDV] [^1124vKHx].

---

## Biochemical pathways and mechanisms

MMA is a **key intermediate in propionate metabolism**, formed from methylmalonyl-CoA and converted to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) with adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as a cofactor [^1124vKHx]. Defects in MMUT or AdoCbl synthesis cause MMA accumulation [^1148WRCV].

---

## Causes of elevated methylmalonic acid

Elevated MMA arises from **genetic, nutritional, pharmacological, and renal factors**:

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Genetic | - MMUT mutations (mut0, mut-) [^113nBd9N] <br/> - Cobalamin pathway defects (cblA, cblB, cblC, cblD) [^116Rodbc] <br/> - Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency [^111HppbB] |
| Nutritional | - Vitamin B12 deficiency (dietary, malabsorption, pernicious anemia) [^114rbYbd] [^115wscRB] |
| Pharmacological | - Metformin (functional B12 deficiency) [^114Loki3] [^1157ErBA] <br/> - Nitrous oxide (inactivates B12) |
| Renal impairment | - Reduced MMA clearance in chronic kidney disease |

---

## Clinical significance and associated conditions

Elevated MMA is **clinically significant** and associated with:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Neuropathy, anemia, cognitive impairment [^114rbYbd] [^115wscRB].
- **Inherited MMA**: Metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia [^1148WRCV], neurologic impairment, renal disease [^116MqMqL].
- **Renal impairment**: Reduced MMA clearance.
- **Metformin-associated neuropathy**: Functional B12 deficiency with neuropathy [^114Loki3] [^1157ErBA].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on **biochemical and genetic testing**: Biochemical tests include plasma or urine MMA [^114rbYbd], serum B12, homocysteine, and renal function tests [^115wscRB], while **genetic testing** evaluates MMUT and cobalamin pathway genes (cblA, cblB, cblC [^1148WRCV], cblD) [^113nBd9N].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: High-dose oral [^116kWjba] or intramuscular B12 [^114rbYbd].
- **Inherited MMA**: Dietary protein restriction, carnitine, metronidazole [^111YR6cw]; transplant or gene/mRNA therapies for severe disease [^114wBNDV] [^1124vKHx].
- **Renal impairment**: Address renal dysfunction and consider dialysis if severe.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause and severity**:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Good with timely treatment [^115wscRB]; delayed therapy risks irreversible neurologic damage [^114rbYbd].
- **Inherited MMA**: Risk of metabolic crises, neurologic impairment [^1148WRCV], renal failure, and early mortality.
- **Renal impairment**: Persistent elevation and complications without renal management.

---

Elevated MMA reflects disrupted propionate metabolism due to genetic, nutritional, pharmacological, or renal causes, and **targeted diagnosis and therapy are essential** to prevent complications.

### Characterizing the mechanism of action for mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and phenylketonuria [^1124vKHx]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

MMA is primarily caused by a defect or deficiency in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), an enzyme that functions just downstream of PCC in the propionate metabolic pathway to catalyze the reversible isomerization of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. A deficiency in MUT blocks the propionate metabolism pathway, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, including methylmalonic acid, 2-MC, and C3. Given the defects in a shared metabolic pathway, patients with MMA experience similar outcomes as those with PA.

PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. Defects in PAH lead to hyperphenylalaninemia, which can disrupt neurologic function, causing severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and psychiatric problems.

- **Standards of care**: The standards of care for each of these disorders center on symptom management or avoiding dietary components that exacerbate the disease. For example, recommendations for patients with PA and MMA include management of acute metabolic decompensation events and diets low in natural proteins to reduce the precursor molecules that funnel into the defective metabolic pathways. While liver transplants for patients with PA and combined liver-kidney transplants for those with MMA have been shown to reduce the number of metabolic decompensations and improve biochemical markers, this practice does not eliminate the risk of disease-related complications.

For patients with PKU, a Phe-restricted diet with pegvaliase-pqpz, tyrosine, and/or appropriate medical therapy is recommended.

### Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in diagnosis and risk assessment from infancy to adolescence [^114rbYbd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in serum and plasma is elevated in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies, whereas methylmalonic acid (MMA) in serum, plasma, or urine is a specific marker of cobalamin function. The combined measurement of both metabolites is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these deficiency states. In addition, tHcy is elevated under various pathologic states (e.g. renal failure), and hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The diagnostic utility of tHcy and MMA concentrations as markers of folate and cobalamin deficiencies in healthy and diseased children has been documented. This article briefly summarizes the biochemical background of tHcy and MMA and the associations of tHcy and MMA with various disease states and focuses on novel data obtained in infants, children, and adolescents, with emphasis on cobalamin status in infants.

The utility of tHcy and MMA as indicators of cobalamin and folate deficiencies in adults can be extended to infants and older children. Furthermore, as in adults, tHcy is related to unhealthy lifestyle factors and is a risk factor for vascular disease. High MMA concentrations in newborns, occasionally denoted as benign methylmalonic aciduria, may reflect impaired cobalamin function.

### Paradoxical elevation of both serum B12 and methylmalonic acid levels in assessing B12 status in children with short-bowel syndrome [^115MpXif]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin B12 (B12) levels is routinely used to monitor B12 sufficiency. However, its accuracy may not be reliable in patients with short-bowel syndrome (SBS). The presence of elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels can also be used as a marker for B12 deficiency. Therefore, our aim was to analyze serum B12 and MMA levels simultaneously in a cohort of children with SBS to evaluate the accuracy of these markers in the assessment of B12 status.

- **Methods**: Children ages 1–18 with intestinal failure were eligible for enrollment. MMA and B12 levels were checked simultaneously in all patients, with 93 sets of labs obtained over 2 years. Fifty percent of the patients were receiving parenteral nutrition. B12 injections were administered to 14 patients who had simultaneously elevated MMA and B12, and a repeat MMA level was measured 4–6 weeks after injection. Data were collected retrospectively.

- **Results**: Forty-eight percent of the lab pairs showed evidence of both elevated MMA and high or normal B12, which contradicted the expected inverse relationship of these markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean MMA values after treatment with B12 injections (412.7 vs 1037.5, P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Paradoxical elevation of MMA with normal or elevated serum B12 is common in children with SBS. Caution should be used when interpreting serum B12 and MMA values in this setting. This may be related to effects of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, a condition commonly seen in these patients.

### Clinical and electroencephalogram characteristics of methylmalonic acidemia with MMACHC and MUT gene mutations [^1148WRCV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the methylmalonic acid CoA mutase enzyme or the enzyme metabolizing cobalamin (vitamin B12). In the body, four amino acids (isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine), odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol can produce propionyl CoA, which is then converted into methylmalonyl CoA and transported into the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle via an enzymatic reaction. The conversion of propionyl CoA to methylmalonyl CoA requires the participation of enzymes, the most important of which is methylmalonyl CoA mutase and its coenzyme 5'-deoxyadenosine cobalamin (AdoCbl, derived from vitamin B12 through a series of enzymatic reactions). Accordingly, either an innate genetic abnormality in the methylmalonyl CoA mutase or a disorder in any part of the evolution of vitamin B12 into an AdoCbl can lead to the accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA and result in methylmalonic acidemia. Additionally, another coenzyme of methylcobalamin (MeCbl), derived from vitamin B12, is necessary to convert homocysteine to methionine, a process that can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia if impaired.

Depending on the presence of homocysteinemia, MMA can be divided into isolated MMA or methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. Isolated MMA includes mut– and mut0 types caused by mutations in the mut gene, cblA type caused by mutations in the MMAA gene, cblB type caused by mutations in the MMAB gene, and cblR type caused by mutations in the CD320 gene.

### Treatment of metabolic disorders using genomic technologies: Lessons from methylmalonic acidemia [^114wBNDV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), caused by a deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT), is a relatively common and severe organic acidemia. The recalcitrant nature of the condition to conventional dietary and medical management has led to the use of elective liver and combined liver-kidney transplantation in some patients. However, liver transplantation is intrinsically limited by organ availability, the risks of surgery, procedural and life-long management costs, transplant comorbidities, and a remaining underlying risk of complications related to MMA despite transplantation.

Here, we review pre-clinical studies that present alternative approaches to solid organ transplantation as a treatment for MMUT MMA, including adeno-associated viral gene addition therapy, mRNA therapy, and genome editing, with and without nuclease enhancement.

### Dietary practices in methylmalonic acidaemia: A European survey [^111YR6cw]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The dietary management of methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) involves a low-protein diet providing sufficient energy to avoid catabolism and limit the production of methylmalonic acid. The goal is to achieve normal growth, maintain good nutritional status, and ensure metabolic stability.

Aim: To describe the dietary management of patients with MMA across Europe.

Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire was sent to European colleagues managing inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) (n = 53) with 27 questions about the nutritional management of organic acidaemias. Data were analyzed by different age ranges (0–6 months; 7–12 months; 1–10 years; 11–16 years; > 16 years).

Results: Questionnaires were returned from 53 centers. Twenty-five centers cared for 80 patients with MMA vitamin B12 responsive (MMAB12r) and 43 centers managed 215 patients with MMA vitamin B12 non-responsive (MMAB12nr).

- **MMAB12r patients**:
	- 44% of centers (n = 11/25) prescribed natural protein below the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations University (WHO/FAO/UNU) 2007 safe levels of protein intake in at least one age range.
	- Precursor-free amino acids (PFAA) were prescribed by 40% of centers (10/25) caring for 36% (29/80) of all the patients.

- **MMAB12nr patients**:
	- 72% of centers (n = 31/43) prescribed natural protein below the safe levels of protein intake (WHO/FAO/UNU 2007) in at least one age range.
	- PFAA were prescribed by 77% of centers (n = 33/43) managing 81% (n = 174/215) of patients.
	- **In MMAB12nr patients, 90 (42%) required tube feeding**: 25 via a nasogastric tube and 65 via a gastrostomy tube.

### Association of metformin, elevated homocysteine, and methylmalonic acid levels and clinically worsened diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^114Loki3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether Cbl supplementation will prevent clinical worsening in this group, but supplementation carries a low risk of toxicity. Therapy consists of intramuscular Cbl replacement therapy and possible long-term Cbl and folate therapy; oral Cbl supplementation may be as effective as intramuscular therapy, although long-term outcomes have not yet been examined in patients with DPN. Oral calcium supplementation has also been effective in reversing bioavailable Cbl deficiency in metformin-treated patients.

Further studies should better define differences in the electrophysiological profile of these groups. Potential central nervous system complications of Cbl deficiency, including myelopathy and cognitive impairment, should be considered as contributors to clinical status. The relationship among Cbl deficiency, elevated Hcy and MMA levels, and peripheral neuropathy is controversial and remains to be proven, but both Cbl deficiency and elevation of its serum metabolites are associated with the presence of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.

Our findings are presented with some limitations. Although we identified patients prospectively, they were not randomly selected from a population with type 2 diabetes with or without DPN. Our sample size was not based on a predetermined power analysis. We did not identify a separate group of patients with asymptomatic DPN. We excluded patients with type 1 diabetes because of their expected limited metformin exposure and the potential for distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^111HppbB]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is one of the most common organic acidurias, with an incidence of 1:48,000 to 1:250,000. Methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) accumulates in the body due to disrupted degradation of valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine. Organic acids, particularly methylmalonate and methylcitrate, form from MMCoA in an alternative metabolic pathway and can cause metabolic acidosis, carnitine deficiency, and secondary hyperammonaemia. When the accumulation of methylmalonic acid is not accompanied by a significant elevation of homocysteine in plasma, it is classified as isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA).

iMMA can be caused by pathogenic mutations in the MMUT gene (MIM#609058), encoding methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut type), in the MCEE gene (MIM#608419), encoding methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, or in the genes encoding enzymes of intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl), leading to the synthesis of the MMUT cofactor adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl): MMAA, MMAB, and MMADHC (CblA, CblB, and CblD2 types, respectively). The MMAB gene (MIM#607568) encodes an adenosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of adenosine from ATP to cobalamin to generate AdoCbl. The MMAA gene (MIM#607481) encodes a protein responsible for proper AdoCbl gating and incorporation from MMAB to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase through a GTP-dependent interaction. If administering high doses of Cbl increases the activity of MMUT, the condition is described as Cbl-responsive iMMA. iMMA subtypes are diagnosed by enzyme assay analysis and/or molecular studies.

### Pathophysiology of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias. Part 1: Complications [^116MqMqL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Over the last decades, advances in clinical care for patients suffering from propionic acidemia (PA) and isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) have resulted in improved survival. These advances were possible thanks to new pathophysiological insights. However, patients may still suffer from devastating complications, which largely determine the unsatisfying overall outcome. To optimize our treatment strategies, better insight into the pathophysiology of complications is needed. Here, we perform a systematic data analysis of cohort studies and case reports on PA and MMA.

- **Hypotheses and evidence**: For each of the prevalent and rare complications, we summarize the hypotheses and evidence for the underlying pathophysiology of that complication. A common hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of many of these complications is that mitochondrial impairment plays a major role.

- **Analysis of complications**: Assuming that complications where mitochondrial impairment may play a role are overrepresented in monogenic mitochondrial diseases, and conversely, that complications where mitochondrial impairment does not play a role are underrepresented, we studied the occurrence of the complications in PA and MMA in mitochondrial and other monogenic diseases, using data provided by the Human Phenotype Ontology.

Lastly, we combined this with evidence from literature to draw conclusions on the possible role of mitochondrial impairment in each complication. Altogether, this review provides a comprehensive overview of what we, at the time of writing, do and do not understand about the pathophysiology of complications occurring in PA and MMA.

### Diabetes as a cause of clinically significant functional cobalamin deficiency [^1157ErBA]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Functional cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency, characterized by high methylmalonic acid (MMA) values despite normal serum Cbl levels, is common in the elderly and associated with neuropathy and anemia. Given that diabetes is also prevalent in the elderly and diabetic neuropathy resembles that of Cbl deficiency, this study explored the role of diabetes in functional Cbl deficiency.

A retrospective review was conducted on all ambulatory, community-dwelling adults with normal renal function evaluated for Cbl deficiency over a 12-year period in a primary care setting. Functional Cbl deficiency was defined by MMA values greater than 250 nmol/L with Cbl levels exceeding 400 pg/mL.

In nondiabetic subjects, MMA values varied directly with age and inversely with serum Cbl. In diabetic subjects, however, although MMA values increased with age, they did not decrease as Cbl levels increased. Notably, when Cbl levels were over 400 pg/mL, both mean MMA values and the incidence of functional Cbl deficiency were significantly higher in elderly diabetic subjects (at least 70 years old) compared to elderly nondiabetic subjects. Additionally, neuropathy was present in 62% of diabetic subjects with high MMA values and only in 18% of diabetic subjects with normal MMA values. Pharmacologic doses of Cbl improved MMA values and neuropathy in 88% and 86% of evaluable diabetic subjects, respectively.

These observations indicate that functional Cbl deficiency is common in elderly diabetic individuals, is associated with neuropathy, and responds well to Cbl therapy. A role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of this deficiency is suggested.

### 1-C-propionate breath testing as a surrogate endpoint to assess efficacy of liver-directed therapies in methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) [^1175FXAa]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of curative therapies for MMA has encouraged the development of alternative approaches to restore enzyme activity, including adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy, systemic messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy, and genome editing. While murine models have repeatedly demonstrated that plasma metabolites, such as methylmalonic acid, can be robust markers of hepatic correction, in MMA patients, serum and urine methylmalonic acid, propionylcarnitine, and 2-methylcitric acid can be highly variable between and within patients. These are directly influenced by dietary protein intake, the gut microbiome, and renal function. Furthermore, in contrast to other disorders such as maple syrup urine disease, metabolites remain massively elevated after successful liver transplantation. Given that mouse models of MMA demonstrated increased 1–13 C-propionate oxidation in response to liver-directed MMUT gene therapy, even in the setting of an expanded circulating methylmalonic acid pool, we sought to explore the use of stable isotopes to quantify in vivo hepatic MMUT function in MMA patients.

Stable isotope tracers provide a safe, nonradioactive analysis of the metabolic fate of a specific compound at the whole-body level and can be administered to patients of all age groups, including newborns. Early studies performed in a small number of patients with methylmalonic and propionic acidemia (MMA, PA) used intravenous administration of radiolabeled 1–14 C-valine or propionate to demonstrate that the metabolism of labeled propionate to 14 CO2 was rapid in controls.

### A novel small molecule approach for the treatment of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^115gP5vR]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are inborn errors of metabolism affecting the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and odd-chain fatty acids. These are multi-organ disorders caused by the enzymatic deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) or methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), resulting in the accumulation of propionyl-coenzyme A (P-CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA (M-CoA in MMA only). Primary metabolites of these CoA esters include 2-methylcitric acid (MCA), propionyl-carnitine (C3), and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which are detectable in both PA and MMA, and methylmalonic acid, which is detectable in MMA patients only.

We deployed liver cell-based models that utilized PA and MMA patient-derived primary hepatocytes to validate a small molecule therapy for PA and MMA patients. The small molecule, HST5040, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of P-CoA, M-CoA (in MMA), and the disease-relevant biomarkers C3, MCA, and methylmalonic acid (in MMA).

- **Putative working model**: How HST5040 reduces the P-CoA and its derived metabolites involves the conversion of HST5040 to HST5040-CoA, driving the redistribution of free and conjugated CoA pools. This results in the differential reduction of the aberrantly high P-CoA and M-CoA. The reduction of P-CoA and M-CoA, either by slowing production (due to increased demands on the free CoA (CoASH) pool) or enhancing clearance (to replenish the CoASH pool), results in a net decrease in the CoA-derived metabolites (C3, MCA, and MMA (MMA only)).

A Phase 2 study in PA and MMA patients is ongoing to further evaluate the efficacy of HST5040.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113XUzQj]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

This update of the MMA and PA guidelines provides a digest of clinically relevant evidence published on these disorders. Based on the current evidence, 21 recommendations were formulated by a diverse panel of metabolic disease healthcare professionals. It is important to note that the participants predominantly had a European/Mediterranean background. For the next revision, there is an intention to overcome this limitation by forming a more heterogeneous panel. Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the optimal management of MMA and PA patients. While more high-quality evidence is needed in the study of MMA and PA, we will continue to regularly evaluate the literature. This ongoing evaluation enables healthcare professionals in the field to make well-informed decisions that are not based solely on dogmatic expert knowledge.

### Prevalence of rare diseases: Bibliographic data [^115SsBqC]. Orphanet Report Series (2024). High credibility.

Worldwide, the prevalence of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria is estimated at 0.00714 per 100,000 population.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113nBd9N]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

This first revision of the MMA and PA guidelines covers the same subtypes of isolated MMA and PA as before. MMA is caused by a deficiency of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme (MMUT), either by a direct defect of the enzyme or by a deficient synthesis of its cofactor adenosylcobalamin. Precursors of this pathway are derived from specific amino acids (valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine), propionate produced by gut bacteria, odd chain fatty acids, as well as the cholesterol side chain.

- **Gene defects and enzymes**: Under isolated MMA, the following gene defects are included: deficiencies of MMUT (OMIM #251000), MMAA (OMIM #251100), MMAB (OMIM #251110), and truncating mutations towards the N-terminal in the MMADHC gene (OMIM #277410). PA (OMIM #606054) is caused by mutations in the PCCA (OMIM #232000) or PCCB gene (OMIM #232050), resulting in deficiency of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme function.

- **Metabolism and biomarkers**: Propionyl-CoA is metabolized in the mitochondria by specific enzymes. Defects in the genes MMUT, MMAA, MMAB, or MMADHC (more specifically variant 2) lead to isolated MMA, whereas defects in PCCA or PCCB lead to PA. Propionyl-CoA is derived from various sources and is metabolized to alternative products in the case of accumulation in the above-described defects. In addition, accumulating methylmalonyl-CoA in isolated MMA is hydrolyzed to methylmalonic acid, the main biomarker of this disease.

Gene names are italicized, and complementation groups are in parentheses. MMA stands for methylmalonic acidaemia and PA for propionic acidaemia.

### Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with elevated methylmalonic acid is caused by SUCLA2 mutations [^115o4c6i]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

We have identified 12 patients with autosomal recessive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with elevated methylmalonic acid. The disorder has a high incidence of 1 in 1700 in the Faroe Islands due to a founder effect and a carrier frequency of 1 in 33. The symptoms comprise hypotonia, muscle atrophy, hyperkinesia, severe hearing impairment, and postnatal growth retardation. Neuroimaging showed demyelination and central and cortical atrophy, including atrophy of the basal ganglia, and some of the patients fulfilled the criteria for Leigh syndrome. Urine and plasma methylmalonic acid were elevated.

Homozygosity mapping with the Affymetrix 10 K array revealed a homozygous region on chromosome 13q14 harboring the SUCLA2 gene. Mutations in SUCLA2 were recently shown to cause a similar disorder in a small Israeli family. Mutation analysis identified a novel splice site mutation in SUCLA2, IVS4 + 1G → A, leading to skipping of exon 4. The SUCLA2 gene encodes the ATP-forming beta subunit of the Krebs cycle enzyme succinyl-CoA ligase. The hallmark of the condition, elevated methylmalonic acid, can be explained by an accumulation of the substrate of the enzyme, succinyl-CoA, which in turn leads to elevated methylmalonic acid because the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA is inhibited.

### Methylmalonic and propionic acidurias: Management without or with a few supplements of specific amino acid mixture [^115rC16n]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2006). Low credibility.

In a series of 137 patients with methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) diagnosed since the early 1970s, we report in more detail on 81 patients (51 MMA and 30 PA) diagnosed between 1988 and 2005. In this series, 14% of patients died at initial access, revealing the disease before or despite treatment. Eighteen percent died later, and the remainder (68%) are still alive. All patients were treated with the same protocol of enteral feeds with a low-protein diet adjusted to individual tolerance, carnitine, antibiotics, and only occasional use of an amino acid (AA) mixture. There was intensive follow-up and monitoring using measurements of urinary urea.

Thirty-nine patients with severe forms, followed for more than 3 years, are analysed in particular detail. Of the 17 PA patients, 6 had moderate disability (all neonatal-onset forms), whereas 11 were normal or slightly delayed in their mental development. Four presented with cardiomyopathy, of whom 2 died.

Of the 22 MMA patients, 13 presented in the neonatal period, of whom 3 died later, 2 are in renal failure, and only 5 are still alive and have a normal or slightly delayed mental development. In the 9 patients with late-onset forms, there were no deaths and all patients but one have normal mental development.

Among the 39 patients, only 40% were given an AA supplement at 3 years, and 50% between 6 and 11 years. The actual intake of natural protein was 0.92, 0.78, and 0.77 g/kg per day at 3, 6, and 11 years, respectively, in patients without AA supplementation, whereas it was 0.75, 0.74, and 0.54 g/kg per day in the group who received AA supplementation.

### Clinical and biochemical studies on Chinese patients with methylmalonic aciduria [^115BETbS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria is a common organic aciduria disease. Recently, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been utilized to diagnose methylmalonic aciduria in China. However, the diagnosis is often delayed due to a lack of technical expertise and the limited experience of general clinicians in China. This study investigated the natural history, clinical features, and outcomes of 77 Chinese patients with methylmalonic aciduria. Of these patients, 31 (40.3%) had isolated methylmalonic aciduria, while 46 (59.7%) had methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinemia. We observed a higher rate of the combined disease than those reported in studies from other countries, suggesting it might be more prevalent in China.

Total plasma homocysteine measurement may enable differential diagnoses of methylmalonic aciduria to be distinguished. The clinical spectrum of these 77 patients ranged from neonatal death and severe symptoms to benign asymptomatic organic aciduria. Neonatal and infantile onset, characteristic of the majority of cases, was associated with greater severity relative to later-onset cases. Among the 17 cases with onset after 3 years of age, only 1 patient had isolated methylmalonic aciduria, while 16 had combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinemia. Nine of the patients with the combined condition fully recovered and exhibited normal intelligence, whereas seven improved with a mild handicap.

### Elevated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) screening markers in Hispanic and preterm newborns [^113NiaP1]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel association between primary NBS metabolic disease markers and a race/ethnicity group. This finding could help explain why MMA false-positive results are more likely in Hispanic than in Black infants, which in turn raises the question of whether Black infants could be at a higher risk for false-negative results. The four MMA patients with below-cutoff C3 and C3/2 in our study cohort were two White newborns (Cbl A or B, GA unknown, BW = 1760 g; mut –, GA = 255 days, BW = 2551 g) and two Hispanic newborns (mut –, GA = 273 days, BW = 3500 g; unclassified, GA = 244 days, BW = 1558 g). Notably, two of the four patients had low BW (< 2500 g) which was found to be associated with decreased C3 and C3/2 and could lead to false-negative results. However, the small number of Black newborns in this cohort (6.6%) limits further conclusions about potential false-negative cases and if different MMA marker thresholds should be considered.

The causes of elevated MMA marker levels in Hispanic newborns are currently unknown. It is possible that systematic disparities based on socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity could affect GA, BW, and overall care, and that access to prenatal vitamins could affect maternal B12 levels. It is also possible that genetic variants associated with race/ethnic groups and with variable biochemical and clinical phenotypes contribute to the identified differences. These findings could inform screening and diagnostic procedures for MMA and potentially other inborn metabolic disorders.

### Isolated methylmalonic acidemia with unusual presentation mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis [^111RH1bE]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening condition requiring early etiologic recognition and management to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. The most common cause is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Organic acidemias (OAs) are inheritable disorders caused by defects in protein metabolism, resulting in acid accumulation. Patients with metabolic decompensation usually present with acidosis, with or without hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia is a very rare manifestation. At least 16 cases of OAs presenting with hyperglycemia have been reported; six of the 16 were diagnosed with isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), and three of the six passed away due to late diagnosis.

- **Case description**: We describe a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented with hyperglycemia, acidosis, and ketosis. She had underlying delayed development, seizures, optic atrophy, and poor growth. An initial diagnosis of DKA was made, and standard treatment was started. After 4 hours of treatment, the patient partially responded; blood sugar decreased, but acidosis and ketonemia persisted. HbA1c was normal. Investigations to rule out OAs were performed. Markedly elevated urinary methylmalonic acid, consistent with MMA, was observed. Molecular and enzyme analyses confirmed the diagnosis of isolated MMA. Specific treatment for MMA, including protein restriction, high caloric fluid, carnitine, and vitamin B12, was promptly started. Clinical improvement was seen 4 days after initiating specific treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Inherited metabolic disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis in hyperglycemia presentations.

### Combining newborn metabolic and DNA analysis for second-tier testing of methylmalonic acidemia [^115UMu8H]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Results

- **Newborn metabolic data analysis**: MMA screen-positive cases are identified by C3 acylcarnitine ≥ 6.5 µmol/L or C3/C2 ratio ≥ 0.25. Both C3 and C3/C2 are equally important primary NBS analytes. Between 2005 and 2015, the California NBS program identified 605 MMA screen positives, including 103 MMA patients and 502 screen false positives. Notably, 4 of the 103 MMA patients had C3 and C3/C2 values below the established thresholds and thus were not technically screen positive for MMA. These 4 cases were screen positive for other NBS metabolic conditions, and elevated MMA levels were seen during follow-up testing, which ultimately led to their MMA diagnosis.

	- To investigate newborn metabolic patterns, we performed an analysis of 46 NBS metabolic analytes in 605 MMA screen positives and 198 controls [Supplementary Figure 1]. Not unexpectedly, we detected a significant difference in C3 between MMA patients and controls (p = 5.3e–28), and a relatively smaller difference between patients and false positives (p = 5.8e–3). Significant differences between MMA patients and false positives were also found for C2 (p = 9.1e–14), C3/C2 (p = 1.2e–10), C18:2 (p = 5.3e–28), methionine (p = 1.5e–8), arginine/ornithine (p = 3.2e–13), and leucine/alanine (p = 4.5e–10). Methionine showed significant differences in MMA phenotypic subgroups, with relatively higher methionine levels in patients with mutase deficiencies (mut 0 or mut -) compared with remethylation defects (CblC, D, or F), and relatively higher methionine levels in preterm false positives [Supplementary Figure 5].

### Response of elevated methylmalonic acid to three dose levels of oral cobalamin in older adults [^116kWjba]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Because the effects of lower-dose oral cobalamin (Cbl) supplements on older people with cobalamin deficiency are not known, we determined whether oral Cbl supplements at three different dose levels would normalize elevated serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations.

- **Design**: Sequential nonrandomized intervention study of three dose levels.

- **Settings**: Two university-based senior care clinics.

- **Participants**: Twenty-three older adults (aged ≥ 65) with serum Cbl levels of 221 pmol/L (300 pg/mL) or lower and serum MMA greater than 271 nmol/L who had been enrolled in a previous screening study for Cbl deficiency (mean age 79 ± 9; 17 male, 6 female; 17 white, 6 other).

- **Intervention**: Sequential daily treatment with 25 microg oral cobalamin, followed by 100 microg and 1,000 microg cobalamin each for a 6-week period.

- **Measurements**: Serum MMA, tHcy, and other metabolites at baseline and after each 6-week dosing interval.

- **Results**: Treatment with 25 microg and 100 microg lowered but did not normalize MMA levels in most subjects. A dose of 1,000 microg/day proved to be the most effective in lowering MMA levels to within normal limits. Serum tHcy was normalized in six of 11 subjects who had elevated tHcy pretreatment with oral Cbl alone and in one subject in combination with a multivitamin.

- **Conclusions**: Most Cbl-deficient older people require more than 100 microg of oral Cbl to normalize serum MMA, which is a larger dose than is available in most standard multivitamins and Cbl supplements.

### Lymphomatosis cerebri presenting as a rapidly progressive dementia with a high methylmalonic acid [^112P6SeJ]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We report a case of a patient with a rapidly progressive dementing illness and gait disturbance, in whom initial screening demonstrated a high methylmalonic acid level only, suggestive of a functional vitamin B(12) deficiency. Despite B(12) replacement therapy, he continued to decline. Further investigations demonstrated extensive signal change on magnetic resonance imaging involving grey and white matter within the corpus callosum, deep grey matter, brainstem, and cerebellar peduncles, as well as patchy post-contrast enhancement. Laboratory testing revealed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, raised anti-nuclear, intrinsic factor and lupus anticoagulant antibody titres, and an IgG kappa paraprotein. Cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. Bone marrow trephine biopsy showed monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance.

The patient initially responded to steroids and underwent a brain biopsy, which was uninformative. However, three weeks following admission, he died due to aspiration pneumonia. Autopsy findings were consistent with diffuse primary central nervous system small cell B-cell lymphoma. This has been rarely reported in the medical literature, but our case exhibits typical clinical features, although patchy enhancement on imaging and the high methylmalonic acid have not been previously described. We hypothesize that his functional B(12) deficiency may have resulted from rapid cell turnover, perhaps in conjunction with the presence of intrinsic factor antibodies.

### Clinical spectrum and genetic variation of six patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA); a report from Iran [^116pBWkW]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of symptomatic MMA patients is based on clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetic data. The gold standard for initial diagnosis and ongoing management, after an abnormal acylcarnitine profile, is biochemical testing using urine organic acids, as well as the measurement of plasma amino acids and total plasma homocysteine. However, mutation analysis helps to decide the right treatment strategy for patients, especially for asymptomatic MMA patients. In the majority (> 97%) of patients with MMA, the disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the MMAA and MMAB genes, while a variant in other genes accounts for only 1–3% of patients. At the time of writing, more than 300 different variants have been reported in different subtypes, most of which are missense or nonsense variants. Without immediate diagnosis and appropriate management, MMA patients become progressively encephalopathic and ultimately progress to coma and even death. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is utilized for the detection and classification of heterogeneous disorders such as MMA. The ability to prompt detection of genes and cost-effectiveness are the two most important advantages of using WES in the diagnosis of MMA.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the genetic background of six Iranian suspected MMA patients using WES.

### Clinical spectrum and genetic variation of six patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA); a report from Iran [^113AsSwV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMAs) is known as a severe, complex, and lethal disorder of methylmalonate and cobalamin. Patients with MMA may develop neurological and metabolic disorders, including liver disease. This study aims to evaluate six Iranian patients suspected of having MMA.

- **Study design**: Genetic results, biochemical analysis, and treatment for these patients are provided. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and variant screening in probands by whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed.

- **Results**: A total of six homozygous variants were identified, including five previously identified variants and one novel variant, in the two MMA-causing genes: c.577G > C, c.290+69G > T, c.662T > A, c.290+69G > T of MMAB, and c.100dupA, c.394 C > T of MMACHC. Sanger sequencing confirmed the identified variants. Additionally, metabolomics data analysis reliably identified elevated C3 and MMA levels, as well as abnormalities in the amino acid profile, indicating the presence of pathogenic variants.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings expand the global spectrum of genotypes in MMA. Whole exome sequencing, combined with metabolomics and biochemical analysis, offers valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and subtyping of MMA. It is most beneficial in complex cases where clinical findings are unclear.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^117PbmqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The second patient with isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA) was classified as mut- or CblA type based on her cobalamin (Cbl) sensitivity. She was born at term with a birth weight of 2,950 g and a length of 51 cm. On the fourth postnatal day, she developed apathy, hypothermia, and dehydration with metabolic acidosis and hyperammonaemia (1,601 μmol/L). Typical iMMA metabolites were detected in her urine, while tHcy and vitamin B12 values in the blood were normal (338 pmol/L).

The patient required 20 hours of peritoneal dialysis, along with a low-protein diet and carnitine and vitamin B12 treatment. Ammonaemia and acidosis normalized within 24 hours from the start of treatment. OH-Cbl administration at a dose of 1 mg intravenously every second day for 10 days was used as an in vivo Cbl sensitivity test. During this period, she began tolerating natural proteins at a dose of 1.4 g/kg/day, and urinary methylmalonic acid levels decreased significantly from 47,686 to 164 μmol/mmol creatinine, indicating that this was the Cbl-responsive type of iMMA.

During follow-up, the child remained metabolically stable, though she exhibited a negative response to intramuscular cobalamin application. Consequently, the Cbl dose was reduced to 1 mg intramuscularly every two weeks, supplemented by daily oral treatment (ranging from 0.3 mg once a week to 0.5 mg per day). Cyano-Cbl was utilized for long-term treatment, as OH-Cbl was only available for patients with confirmed intracellular cobalamin defects in the country. Despite maintaining a diet with minimal protein restriction, the disease course remained favorable, with serum vitamin B12 levels increasing from 834 to over 1,476 pmol/L.

### Newborn screening and early biochemical follow-up in combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type, and utility of methionine as a secondary screening analyte [^113uois9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cobalamin C (cblC) type, is an inherited disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism caused by mutations in MMACHC. CblC typically presents in the neonatal period with neurological deterioration, failure to thrive, cytopenias, and multisystem pathology, including renal and hepatic dysfunction. Rarely, affected individuals present in adulthood with gait ataxia and cognitive decline. Treatment with hydroxocobalamin may ameliorate the clinical features of early-onset disease and prevent clinical late-onset disease. Propionic acidemia (PA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), and various disorders of cobalamin metabolism are characterized by elevated propionylcarnitine (C3) on newborn screening (NBS). Distinctions can be made between these disorders with secondary analyte testing. Elevated methionine is already routinely used as an NBS marker for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. We propose that low methionine may be useful as a secondary analyte for specific detection of cbl disorders among a larger pool of infants with elevated C3 on NBS.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of dried blood spot (DBS) data in patients with molecularly confirmed cblC disease.

- **Results**: Nine out of ten patients with confirmed cblC born in New York between 2005 and 2008 had methionine below 13.4 µmol/L on NBS. Elevated C3, elevated C3:C2 ratio, and low methionine were incorporated into a simple screening algorithm that can be used to improve the specificity of newborn screening programs and provide a specific and novel method of distinguishing.

### Brain damage by mild metabolic derangements in methylmalonic acidemia [^116URUqw]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by an l-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency. The mut(0) type is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. However, tandem mass spectrometry has made early detection possible. Five patients were identified through newborn screening for elevated propionylcarnitine (C3-carnitine) levels. These patients received a positive screening result at a median age of 10 days (range, 5–18 days). When treated at a median age of 11 days (range, 3–50 days), two patients were asymptomatic, and only one was significantly acidotic (pH < 7.2). All had various degrees of hyperammonemia (range, 127–1,244 µmol/L).

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in four patients shortly after diagnosis, and the results were all abnormal. Four patients were followed, and there was no further metabolic decompensation after the initial episodes. However, their mean developmental quotient was only 50. These results suggest that early hyperammonemia can lead to significant brain damage in methylmalonic acidemia. Therefore, treatment of this disease in newborns must be more aggressive.

### Very long-term outcomes in 23 patients with cblA type methylmalonic acidemia [^115b4iut]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Importantly, our data suggests that, although protein restriction, B12, and energy supply are essential in the emergency management and prevention of acute decompensations, no clear-cut correlation exists between the initial long-term treatments and the final cognitive outcome, since intellectual disability was found in about 30%–40% of the patients, independently of the initial treatment modality (B12, protein restriction, or both). However, we cannot exclude that late diagnosis and treatment still contributed to the global high percentage of intellectual disability in this series.

The high percentage of patients with intellectual disability was not linked to the co-occurrence of consanguinity, since intellectual disability was rather equally present in the patients with and without consanguinity (33% and 44%, respectively). Instead, only one case (14%) of moderate and late-onset renal failure was found in patients treated early with B12, compared to 33% with chronic kidney disease in the group who did not initially receive B12 supplementation. This suggests that B12 treatment, despite being administered at variable doses and frequency, is very important in preventing or at least delaying renal dysfunction. Indeed, in a recent series in which B12 was administered to 78% of the patients, chronic kidney disease was reported only in 9% of cblA patients.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: A case report [^112eDzZX]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

During the years 2002–2020, seven patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA) were diagnosed in our center. All were treated with diet, carnitine, and vitamins. Vitamin B12 treatment was modified according to the result of the in vivo Cbl sensitivity test.

Here we report on two patients who manifested similarly in the first week of life with a severe metabolic crisis. Neurological symptomatology was accompanied by metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonaemia was above 1,000 μmol/L. Despite similar clinical signs in the manifestation period, the children differed in the course of the disease. Data were obtained retrospectively from the inpatient documentation and outpatient follow-up.

- **Patient 1**: The first patient with iMMA was considered as mut 0 type due to the severe clinical symptomatology. The boy was born at term with a birth weight of 2,900 g and a length of 49 cm. On the third postnatal day, he presented with vomiting, Kussmaul breathing, apathy, and hypotonus. Severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2, base excess -23 mmol/L) with hyperammonaemia (260 μmol/L) was confirmed. The profile of organic acids in the urine indicated the diagnosis of MMA — high excretion of methylmalonic acid and methylcitrate. He also had a slightly increased concentration of tHcy (24 μmol/L). The vitamin B12 levels in serum were not assessed as this measurement was not available at that time in our setting. The concentration of ammonia in the blood rose rapidly to 1,097 μmol/L, and the child required elimination treatment in addition to carnitine and a low-protein diet. Ammonia in plasma decreased from 1,097 to 6.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113uUfVH]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

As the propionyl‐CoA carboxylase enzyme requires biotin as a cofactor, nutritional biotin deficiency or a defect of the enzymes biotinidase (BTD gene, OMIM #609019) or holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS gene, OMIM #609018) must be excluded to finalize the diagnosis of PA. In all these cases, the urinary organic acid profiles would not only include elevated levels of the metabolites pathognomonic for PA (3‐hydroxypropionate and 2‐methylcitrate), but also other metabolites arising from deficiencies of other biotin-dependent carboxylases such as methylcrotonylglycine.

Both MMA and PA are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. To confirm the biochemical diagnosis, guide management, and allow genetic counseling of families, it is necessary to identify the underlying genetic defect. Isolated MMA can be caused by defects in four different genes, including MMUT (mut subtypes), MMAA (cblA), MMAB (cblB), and MMADHC (cblD‐MMA). Specific mutations in MMADHC can also lead to a combined phenotype of MMA and homocystinuria or isolated homocystinuria. In the rare case of inconclusive genetic results, complementation studies, the propionate incorporation assay, or enzyme activity measurements in fibroblasts can aid in the diagnostic process. Many of the known MMUT mutations have been functionally tested with the aforementioned assays, allowing the historic classification as a mut 0 subtype (no response to hydroxocobalamin supplementation in the propionate incorporation assay) or a mut − subtype (increased propionate incorporation upon addition of hydroxocobalamin to the cell culture).

### Neurodegeneration and chronic renal failure in methylmalonic aciduria — a pathophysiological approach [^113cBhXZ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

In recent decades, the survival of patients with methylmalonic aciduria has improved; however, the overall outcome for affected patients remains disappointing. The disease course is often complicated by acute life-threatening metabolic crises, which can result in multiple organ failure or even death, resembling primary defects of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Biochemical abnormalities during metabolic derangement, such as metabolic acidosis, ketonaemia/ketonuria, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonaemia, suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. Long-term complications, such as chronic renal failure and neurological disease, are also frequently observed.

Neuropathophysiological studies have focused on various effects caused by the accumulation of putatively toxic organic acids, under the so-called 'toxic metabolite' hypothesis. In previous studies, methylmalonate (MMA) was considered the major neurotoxin in methylmalonic aciduria. More recent studies emphasize a synergistic inhibition of mitochondrial energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiratory chain, mitochondrial salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)) induced by propionyl-CoA, 2-methylcitrate, and MMA as the key pathomechanism of inherited disorders of propionate metabolism. Intracerebral accumulation of toxic metabolites ('trapping' hypothesis) is considered a biochemical risk factor for neurodegeneration. Secondary effects of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as oxidative stress and impaired mtDNA homeostasis, also contribute to pathogenesis.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: A case report [^116o4YFP]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The child's motor development was adequate during the first year of life. However, over the next three years, he experienced several metabolic decompensations with severe metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia, and subsequent deterioration in neurological development. At the age of 4 years, during a severe metabolic crisis with prolonged metabolic acidosis, the child was treated with 1 mg/day cyano-Cbl intramuscularly for 7 days. He had a significant reduction of urinary methylmalonic acid (see Fig. 1a). However, he also received high-dose energy infusions delivered via a central venous catheter; therefore, cyano-Cbl treatment was stopped since the patient was metabolically compensated.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: A case report [^113HTRyJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Based on our experience, we suggest a scheme for the diagnostic procedure for the recognition of Cbl-sensitive forms of isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA). Fifty-two percent of cobalamin non-responsive and 67% of responsive MMA cases identified in newborn screening are still asymptomatic at 8 days of life and can be tested as recommended by Fowler et al. Patients who are not metabolically stable require prior stabilization, or they may not be suitable for the test at all. In such cases, genetic testing is helpful, particularly if enzymatic testing is not available.

Asymptomatic patients or those stable without vitamin B12 treatment can undergo the test of responsiveness according to Fowler et al. The sensitivity of unstable patients can be deduced from the results of genetic testing or enzymatic studies, if available.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^114iAGqi]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

When diagnosing methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) or propionic acidaemia (PA), it is crucial for the physician to identify a clinical picture suggestive of these conditions. This process can be challenging as many clinical signs are non-specific. MMA and PA may present with acute, chronic, or intermittent symptoms, often aggravated by or occurring following a 'trigger' event. Symptoms include vomiting, weight loss, hypoglycemia, neurological deterioration with hypotonia, irritability, and lethargy, potentially leading to coma in cases of acute early-onset neonatal presentations. This clinical presentation may be accompanied by biochemical findings such as metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia. Triggers of acute episodes can include post-partum neonatal stress and other catabolic states induced by infection or prolonged fasting. Late-onset patients present with a wider range of signs, including failure to thrive, neurological symptoms (such as encephalopathy and developmental delay), and cardiac and kidney manifestations.

- **Table 2**: Potential signs and symptoms at presentation observed in MMA and PA patients.

Laboratory diagnosis involves suspecting organic acidaemia based on clinical assessment, basic laboratory parameters, or abnormal results from newborn screening. The diagnosis of MMA or PA is confirmed by measuring organic acids in urine.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^111jLEKV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The strength of each recommendation was rated by the panelists based on the quality of the evidence, as well as the balance of benefits and harms, values, preferences, and resources. Recommendations were downgraded to the lower category (weak) if the distribution of votes was exactly equal (Figure S2B).

- **Strong recommendations**: Indicated by 'we recommend'; weak recommendations by 'we suggest'. Some recommendations were considered extremely well-founded on clinical grounds or would have serious consequences if not followed, while others were clearly supported by biochemical facts and well-established medical knowledge. In these cases, the wording of the recommendation was strengthened ('we strongly recommend'). For approval ratings for each recommendation, see Figure S3.

- **Figure 3**: Proposed management flowchart for MMA and PA patients during an acute metabolic decompensation, based on expert opinion. All drugs are given intravenously (IV). MMA, methylmalonic acidaemia; PA, propionic acidaemia.

2.3 Guidelines Objective

The purpose of these guidelines is to serve health care professionals working with MMA and PA patients as an evidence-based reference to provide optimal patient care. When clear-cut recommendations could not be reached because of poor evidence quality, the presented collation of the body of the evidence may serve as a reference when considering specific aspects of MMA and PA patient care. However, the guidelines do not replace comprehensive clinical reflection and assessment of each patient's individual situation. These guidelines attempt to provide guidance.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^115htg3k]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

- **Haematological complications**: Haematological abnormalities are common in MMA and PA. Pancytopenia, especially neutropenia, at initial presentation or during metabolic decompensation, as well as during the chronic disease course, has been frequently described. Isolated thrombocytopenia can be observed during acute metabolic decompensations. Anaemia may present chronically and depend on other factors such as the presence of chronic kidney disease. Other postulated mechanisms include reversible suppressive effects of toxic metabolites on bone marrow function.

Deficiencies of substrates for blood cell production (vitamin B12, folic acid, iron) should be excluded in patients with haematological abnormalities. Treatment of anaemia with erythropoietin in patients with chronic kidney disease should follow common nephrology standards. The indication for treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is unclear, as there is very limited experience in MMA and PA patients.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^116Rodbc]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Isolated methylmalonic aciduria can be caused by pathogenic mutations in the gene for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase or in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the intracellular metabolism of cobalamin. Some mutations may be cobalamin responsive. The type of methylmalonic aciduria cannot always be assumed from clinical manifestation; the responsiveness to cobalamin must be assessed for appropriate administration, or to avoid unnecessary treatment. The cases presented herein highlight the importance of genetic testing in methylmalonic aciduria and the need for standardization of the in vivo cobalamin-responsiveness assessment.

- **Case presentation**: We describe two patients who presented in the first week of life with rapid neurological deterioration caused by metabolic acidosis with severe hyperammonaemia. This condition required extracorporeal elimination in addition to protein restriction, energy support, carnitine, and vitamin B12 treatment. The severity of the clinical symptoms and high methylmalonic acid concentrations in the urine (> 30,000 μmol/mmol of creatinine) without hyperhomocysteinaemia in both patients suggested isolated methylmalonic aciduria. Based on the neonatal manifestation and high methylmalonic acid urine levels, we assumed the cobalamin non-responsive form. The in vivo test of responsiveness to cobalamin was performed in both patients. Patient 1 was evaluated as non-responsive; thus, intensive treatment with vitamin B12 was not used. Patient 2 was responsive to cobalamin, but the dose was decreased to 1 mg i.m. every two.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: A critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). High credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys exhibit subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application remains crucial yet unsettled. This review critically examines the diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations.

Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in the degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD.

The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all biomarkers make the combination of multiple tests an increasingly preferred diagnostic approach to enhance accuracy.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^116y3tN9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The first guidelines on isolated methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) were published in September 2014. They have been accessed over 53,000 times on the journal's website and cited 182 times according to Web of Science (July 2020). The attention the guidelines received signifies the interest and utilization by healthcare professionals of this evidence evaluation and the recommendations deduced by an expert panel. Particularly in the rare disease field, the structured evaluation of the present evidence is of great value since the process involves specific considerations related to the rarity of these disorders. High-quality trials in large samples, which would produce firm and reliable evidence, are scarce given the small patient populations, often rendering the present evidence low quality. As a result, evidence collected from case series or smaller studies needs to be carefully evaluated.

The advances in the field and the success of the first MMA/PA guidelines prompted us to provide an update six years later. The guidelines presented here use a different and more up-to-date system to evaluate evidence than the first version — the 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach. This approach is more suitable for the rare disease field as it partially accounts for the previously described challenges. Due to the change of methods, the entire body of literature on MMA and PA referenced on PubMed was newly evaluated. Since the publication of the initial guidelines, new advances have been made, and more data have been collected.

Acylcarnitines are intermediates of oxidative metabolism that consist of an acyl group esterified to a carnitine molecule. They derive from acyl‐CoAs and are generated by both mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT‐1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT‐2), carnitine acetyltransferase, and other not fully characterized enzymes whose primary purpose is transporting long‐chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for β-oxidation, or to bind and remove abnormal metabolites. Patients with defects in branched‐chain amino acid catabolism or inherited disorders of fatty acid metabolism accumulate disease‐specific acylcarnitines in body fluids.

Long‐chain acylcarnitines (LCACs) are implicated in several biological processes, including cardiac function, ion balance, insulin signaling in muscle, inflammation, cellular stress, and modulation of protein kinase C. However, a specific physiologic role or toxicity of C3 has not been demonstrated. Probably the most well-characterized clinical application of measurement of C3 is in newborn screening, where it is elevated in MMA and PA. In an affected newborn, acetylcarnitine (C2) is usually normal, and thus the C3/C2 ratio (a proxy for propionyl‐CoA/acetyl‐CoA) can be elevated up to 20‐fold. A C3/C2 ratio of > 0.4 suggests a diagnosis of PA/MMA, but the false‐positive rate is high. In general, the level of C3 reflects disease severity, but the relationship is imperfect as it can also vary according to diet and is affected by kidney disease.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^111esVGq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The literature search and evidence grading for these guidelines began with the use of the SIGN method, while the revised guidelines employed the GRADE methodology.

To compile the initial evidence base, a PubMed search was conducted on September 29, 2019. The search terms included: "propionic acidemia", "propionic acidaemia", "propionic aciduria", "methylmalonic acidemia", "methylmalonic acidaemia", and "methylmalonic aciduria", as well as their plural forms. Further limitations were applied, including publication dates between January 1, 1900, and September 5, 2019, English language, and exclusion of animal-only studies in favor of human studies. This search resulted in 1,488 entries. Articles were manually sorted into 194 clinical reports focusing on patients with methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and/or propionic acidaemia (PA), excluding laboratory-based studies and case reports with fewer than three patients.

Specific case reports were aggregated for certain inquiries. The panel deemed eight articles published after the cut-off date and seven articles referenced in the initial clinical reports as particularly significant, leading to a total of 209 articles considered. Articles were categorized as 'high', 'moderate', or 'low' quality of evidence regarding specific outcomes by at least two panelists.

### A critical reappraisal of dietary practices in methylmalonic acidemia raises concerns about the safety of medical foods. Part 1: isolated methylmalonic acidemias [^111VrEQk]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Medical foods for methylmalonic acidemias (MMAs) and propionic acidemias contain minimal valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine but have been formulated with increased leucine. We aimed to assess the effects of imbalanced branched-chain amino acid intake on metabolic and growth parameters in a cohort of patients with MMA ascertained via a natural history study.

Cross-sectional anthropometric and body-composition measurements were correlated with diet content and disease-related biomarkers in 61 patients with isolated MMA (46 mut, 9 cblA, and 6 cblB).

Patients with MMA tolerated close to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of complete protein (mut(0): 99.45 ± 32.05% RDA). However, 85% received medical foods, in which the protein equivalent often exceeded complete protein intake (35%). Medical food consumption resulted in low plasma valine and isoleucine concentrations, prompting paradoxical supplementation with these propiogenic amino acids. Weight- and height-for-age z-scores correlated negatively with the leucine-to-valine intake ratio (r = -0.453; P = 0.014; R² = 0.209 and r = -0.341; P = 0.05; R² = 0.123, respectively).

Increased leucine intake in patients with MMA resulted in iatrogenic amino acid deficiencies and was associated with adverse growth outcomes. Medical foods for propionate oxidation disorders need to be redesigned and studied prospectively to ensure efficacy and safety.

### Long-term follow-up of Chinese patients with methylmalonic acidemia of the cblC and mut subtypes [^115VbPK7]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

The MMA prognosis depends largely on the subtypes. Despite similar poor prognosis rates of around 70%, mut-MMA patients have a markedly higher mortality rate and higher levels of all four MMA biochemical indicators after treatment compared to cblC-MMA patients. These findings indicate a worse outcome in the mut-MMA group, which may be attributed to more frequent episodes of acute metabolic decompensation, earlier onset, and lower VitB12-responsive rate of mut-MMA patients (Table 1).

Furthermore, the "pre-treatment onset" and unresponsiveness to VitB12 treatment were also independently associated with poor prognosis and neurologic disorders in mut-MMA patients, as evidenced by our multivariate analysis and previous studies. Moreover, elevated baseline levels of C3 and C3/C2 were predicted as independent positive predictors of death and anemia in mut-MMA patients, respectively. In MMA, a significant quantity of propionyl-CoA is unable to be converted to succinyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle due to enzyme defects and needs to be combined with carnitine to form C3 for excretion. Therefore, elevated C3 can be an indicator of abnormal propionate catabolism. C3/C2 is considered a more specific metabolic indicator than C3. Consequently, abnormal propionate metabolism is highly correlated with death and anemia observed in mut patients, which requires strict monitoring and control.

Finally, the c.914T > C variant in the MMUT gene, specific to the Chinese population, was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality, emphasizing the importance of rigorous management.

### Association of metformin, elevated homocysteine, and methylmalonic acid levels and clinically worsened diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^112uoB4e]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

After comprehensive clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory testing, monthly intramuscular Cbl was prescribed for patients exhibiting abnormal Cbl, MMA, or Hcy levels. Sural nerve biopsies were performed only in clinical scenarios where vasculitis or another serious cause of peripheral neuropathy was suspected.

Group equivalence in patient age, duration of type 2 diabetes, duration of peripheral neuropathy symptoms, A1C, and alcohol exposure were compared using independent-samples t-tests. Sex and the proportion of those using other antidiabetic agents were evaluated by a χ² test. Elements of the past medical history, such as iron deficiency anemia and hereditary spherocytosis, were broadly classified as hematological diseases and are summarized in Table 1; these were not compared statistically due to their heterogeneity. Details are provided in the appendix (available online).

The primary outcome measures included Hcy, MMA, and Cbl blood levels, clinical neuropathy severity (TCSS and NIS), and electrophysiological markers of neuropathy. For the latter, sensory NCS in the lower extremity, specifically conduction velocity and SNAP for superficial peroneal and sural nerves, were tested as these aligned with exacerbation due to Cbl deficiency. Data did not follow a normal distribution, as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test, leading to analyses using a Mann-Whitney U test. Proportions of patients with Cbl deficiency and upregulation of Hcy and MMA were compared using χ² tests. Bivariate correlations of clinical and laboratory variables with cumulative metformin usage were also assessed.

### Early-onset combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria: Neuroradiologic findings [^117VJVPp]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria (MMA-HC) is caused by impaired hepatic conversion of dietary cobalamin to methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, resulting in decreased activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. Patients with the early-onset variety present within 12 months of age with severe neurologic, hematologic, and gastrointestinal abnormalities. We describe the neuroradiologic features of early-onset MMA-HC and discuss related pathophysiological mechanisms.

- **Methods**: Twelve infants with hypotonia, failure to thrive, poor feeding, and hematologic abnormalities were diagnosed with MMA-HC based on a typical plasmatic and urinary metabolic profile and enzyme activity in fibroblastic cultures. Complementation studies were performed in two cases and yielded a CblC result. MR imaging was performed at presentation in four cases and later in the others. All patients showed prompt biochemical improvement with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin administration, and most had moderate neurologic improvement.

- **Results**: Diffuse supratentorial white matter edema and dysmyelination was the typical MR picture at presentation, whereas white matter bulk loss characterized later stages of the disease. Nucleocapsular areas of gliosis were an additional finding in one case. One patient had tetraventricular hydrocephalus at presentation.

- **Conclusion**: White matter damage is probably caused by reduced methyl group availability and nonphysiological fatty acids toxicity, whereas focal gliosis results from homocysteine-induced toxicity.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^115mPmHw]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2: What is the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis?**
	- A. Skin biopsy
B. Direct immunofluorescence
C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation
D. Dosage of urine organic acid (methylcitric acid and methylmalonic acid)
E. Dosages of blood/urine parameters (glucose level, ammonemia, bicarbonate level, and ketone)

- **Answers**:

	- A. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A skin biopsy can be performed to eliminate differential diagnoses such as autoimmune bullous dermatosis (pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid) and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Because the histopathologic findings are not specific (psoriasiform pattern, confluent necrosis of keratinocytes, and intraepidermal vacuolization, etc), a skin biopsy is not recommended.

	- B. Direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Similar to a skin biopsy, direct immunofluorescence is an invasive technique, especially for newborns and infants. The skin sample can reveal a deposit of IgG or C3, which is not specific to this diagnosis.

	- C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation – Correct. MMA occurs because of a defective conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the absence of MUT. The search for the mutation analysis is performed in specialized centers (not available in our country) and is the gold standard diagnosis. It can also help in the choice of treatment strategies and can predict whether a patient will respond to vitamin B12 injections.

	- D. Dosage of urine organic acid (methylcitric acid and methylmalonic acid) – Incorrect. The detection of urine organic acid using chromatography or mass spectrometry may lead to the diagnosis.

### Glutathione metabolism in cobalamin deficiency type C (cblC) [^115ejfj4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria, cblC defect, is the most frequent disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism. CblC patients are commonly treated with multidrug therapy to reduce metabolite accumulation and increase deficient substrates. However, the long-term outcome is often unsatisfactory, especially in patients with early onset, with frequent progression of neurological and ocular impairment. Recent studies have shown perturbation of cellular redox status in cblC. To evaluate the potential contribution of oxidative stress to the pathophysiology of the cblC defect, we have analyzed the in vivo glutathione metabolism in a large series of cblC deficient individuals.

- **Methods**: Levels of different forms of glutathione were measured in lymphocytes obtained from 18 cblC patients and compared with age-matched controls. Furthermore, we also analyzed plasma cysteine and total homocysteine.

- **Results**: We found an imbalance of glutathione metabolism in cblC patients, with a significant decrease of total and reduced glutathione, along with a significant increase of different oxidized glutathione forms.

- **Conclusions**: These findings show a relevant in vivo disturbance of glutathione metabolism, underlining the contribution of glutathione pool depletion to the redox imbalance in treated cblC patients. Our study may be helpful in addressing future research to better understand the pathogenetic mechanism of the disease and in developing new therapeutic approaches, including the use of novel vitamin B₁₂ derivatives.

### Molecular and biochemical alterations in tubular epithelial cells of patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria [^113wmJ8b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidurias (MMAurias) are a group of inherited disorders in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol. These disorders are caused by a complete or partial deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut(0) and mut(-) subtype, respectively) and by defects in the metabolism of its cofactor 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (cblA, cblB, or cblD variant 2 type). A long-term complication found in patients with the mut(0) and cblB variant is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The underlying pathomechanism has remained unknown.

We established an in vitro model of tubular epithelial cells from patient urine (hTEC; 9 controls, 5 mut(0), 1 cblB). In all human tubular epithelial cell (hTEC) lines, we found specific tubular markers (AQP1, UMOD, AQP2). Patient cells showed a disturbance of energy metabolism in glycolysis, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the Krebs cycle, all in concert with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Electron micrographs indicated increased autophagosome production and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was supported by positive acridine orange staining and elevated levels of LC3 II, P62, and pIRE1. Screening mTOR signaling revealed a release of inhibition of autophagy. Patient hTEC produced and secreted elevated amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL8, which was highly correlated with the acridine orange staining.

In summary, hTEC of MMAuria patients are characterized by disturbed energy metabolism and ROS production that lead to increased autophagy and IL8 secretion.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^115HFUuN]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

**Conjugates: propionylglycine and tiglylglycine**: The presence of propionylglycine and tiglylglycine in urine can be used to support a diagnosis of PA or MMA, but they are not suitable for use as biomarkers. Like 3‐hydroxypropionic acid, propionylglycine levels are positively correlated with plasma ammonium, but changes in propionylglycine levels are highly variable and do not provide consistent evidence to monitor treatment outcomes in these patients.

### Growth hormone deficiency associated with methylmalonic acidemia [^115x2C66]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Poor growth is a common finding in patients with organic acidemias. Growth hormone (GH) therapy has been considered in the management of these disorders as a mode to enhance anabolism and lower the high levels of methylmalonic acid. We report two patients with methylmalonic acidemia (mut(o)) and GH deficiency. Both patients had persistently elevated serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid, which failed to respond to conventional therapy. In anticipation of using GH therapy to reduce high methylmalonic acid concentrations, the first patient underwent GH testing utilizing a provocative glucagon stimulation test and was found to be deficient. He was subsequently treated with GH and demonstrated improved growth, but his methylmalonic acid concentrations remain elevated. The second patient was also found to be GH deficient. These findings suggest that GH deficiency may be an etiologic factor in the poor growth seen in patients with organic acidemia.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^116Ko2k2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Conducting clinical trials for new drug treatments for propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a highly complex process. This complexity arises from the rarity, heterogeneity, mortality, and unpredictable outcomes associated with these inborn errors of metabolism. Choosing appropriate clinical endpoints for such trials is especially challenging. Consequently, there is a clear need to identify biomarkers for PA and MMA that could serve as surrogate endpoints, aiding in the investigation of new therapies for these rare diseases.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^115Ejttb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Metronidazole, administered at 10 to 20 mg/kg/day in two to three doses, has been part of the standard long-term management to reduce bacterial propionate production in the gut despite low quality of evidence for a benefit. There is no evidence demonstrating neuropathy as an intrinsic long-term complication in MMA or PA, but peripheral neuropathy has been observed in PA patients under metronidazole treatment, and metronidazole is a known cause of peripheral neuropathy. Other side effects include QTc prolongation and pancreatitis; hence, metronidazole treatment should be cautiously indicated in MMA and PA patients. If metronidazole is not well tolerated, alternative antibiotics, including amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole, have been applied.

Whether carglumic acid can consistently reduce the number of metabolic decompensations needs to be further studied. It has been tried to anapleurotically support Krebs cycle function by providing citrate, which was associated with reduced number of hospitalisations in three PA patients.

Some MMA patients clearly benefit from parenteral cobalamin treatment. Patients with cblA will mostly improve, and cblB have been described to respond in one third of the cases. Among the MMUT-deficient patients, the mut− subgroup is more likely to show benefits from cobalamin injections, although clear evidence of cobalamin responsiveness in mut− patients is lacking. The ideal application route is intramuscular, and hydroxocobalamin is the preferred form of the cobalamin molecule. A protocol to evaluate biochemical responsiveness has been proposed.
