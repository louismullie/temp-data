## Question

What other pharmacological agents could be considered for treatment of RBD, such as pramipexole or donepezil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacological agents, beyond clonazepam and melatonin, can be considered for treating REM sleep behavior disorder, with specific interest in pramipexole and donepezil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current guideline-backed options and where pramipexole and donepezil fit. Then, I should verify the strength and quality of evidence for each agent. Next, I will examine dosing, safety, and special populations. After that, I should review alternatives for refractory cases and drug-induced RBD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the guideline framework so I don't jump to conclusions. The 2023 American Academy of Sleep Medicine guideline issues conditional recommendations for isolated RBD to consider clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, pramipexole, and transdermal rivastigmine in selected contexts, while emphasizing that head-to-head trials are lacking and evidence quality varies, so shared decision-making is essential [^c216a435] [^7e82a292] [^2f3d3fe9].

> Now, pramipexole: I should confirm its status and mechanism. The AASM suggests pramipexole as a conditional option for isolated RBD, particularly when periodic limb movements are prominent on polysomnography, with typical dosing starting at 0.125 mg at bedtime and titrating slowly up to about 2.0 mg nightly; the task force notes the mechanism is uncertain because RBD is not a dopaminergic disorder, so benefit may relate to reducing ancillary motor activity or treating coexisting PLMS rather than directly restoring REM atonia [^7fbfbdfb] [^6866a415]. Wait, let me verify the evidence quality: the recommendation is based on seven observational studies showing clinically significant improvements, but the certainty is very low due to imprecision and bias, so I need to counsel patients accordingly and monitor closely for adverse effects like next-day hangover, GI symptoms, and impulse-control behaviors [^6866a415] [^825c622a].

> Hold on, I should verify safety specifics for pramipexole. Somnolence and sleep attacks can occur, and patients may fall asleep during activities of daily living, so I need to screen for concomitant sedatives, sleep disorders, and drugs that raise pramipexole levels, and advise against driving if significant daytime sleepiness emerges; orthostatic hypotension can also occur, especially during titration, so I should monitor blood pressure and falls risk, particularly in older adults or those with autonomic dysfunction [^f2d01365] [^a0e0e752]. I should double-check that these risks are balanced against injury prevention from dream enactment, which the guideline weighs favorably in many cases, but I must individualize based on comorbidities and patient preferences [^6866a415].

> Next, donepezil: I need to check whether it is recommended at all. The AASM guideline does not recommend donepezil for RBD; instead, it supports transdermal rivastigmine in isolated RBD with mild cognitive impairment and in secondary RBD due to Parkinson's disease, based on randomized data showing reductions in RBD episode frequency, albeit with moderate certainty due to imprecision and adverse effects like hypotension, asthenia, nausea, and daytime sleepiness [^8f721470] [^2b22bfc4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought donepezil might be included because it is a cholinesterase inhibitor like rivastigmine, but I should correct that: the recommendation is specific to rivastigmine and does not extend to donepezil or galantamine, so donepezil should not be considered a guideline-endorsed option for RBD at this time [^c216a435].

> I will now examine other conditional options to ensure I'm not missing anything. Immediate-release melatonin remains a conditional first-line option with a favorable safety profile, typically starting at 3 mg and titrating up to about 15 mg, and it is often preferred in older adults or when clonazepam risks are high; clonazepam is also conditional first-line but requires caution due to sedation, falls, cognitive effects, and potential worsening of obstructive sleep apnea, so I should screen for these before prescribing [^c216a435] [^e03907c4] [^e5d90a14]. Let me reconsider combination therapy: clonazepam plus melatonin is commonly used in practice when monotherapy is inadequate, though high-quality evidence is limited, so I should document rationale and monitor closely if I combine agents [^b0a41ac5].

> For refractory cases, I should confirm what alternatives have supportive but lower-level evidence. Sodium oxybate has case-level evidence of benefit in severe, refractory RBD, including in Parkinson's disease, but data are sparse and access may be limited; ramelteon has limited and mixed evidence and is not currently recommended by AASM; similarly, memantine and paroxetine have been explored but lack sufficient evidence for routine use in RBD, so I should reserve these for carefully selected scenarios after standard options fail [^7ed5571f] [^f9431fd9] [^f6b27559]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating any of these; yes, the guideline explicitly notes insufficient evidence for ramelteon, sodium oxybate, paroxetine, and others, reinforcing that these are not first- or second-line standards [^f9431fd9].

> But wait, what if the RBD is drug-induced? I need to ensure I address that. For drug-induced or exacerbated RBD, especially with SSRIs or other serotonergic agents, the AASM recommends conditional discontinuation of the offending drug if safe, recognizing that improvement may take weeks to months and that alternative antidepressants with lower serotonergic profiles, such as bupropion, may be considered if antidepressant therapy is still needed; if dream enactment persists after stopping the culprit, I should reclassify as isolated or secondary RBD and treat per guidelines [^96061232] [^fb24f6f6]. I should double-check that this applies across ages; yes, drug-induced RBD is particularly common in younger patients, so medication reconciliation is essential in that group [^0176f94d].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. First, confirm the diagnosis with polysomnography when feasible and implement safety measures for the bedroom environment, because injury prevention is foundational regardless of pharmacotherapy [^96c667fb] [^0c6461db]. Second, choose among conditional first-line pharmacotherapies based on comorbidities, age, fall risk, cognitive status, and patient preference: melatonin is often a good starting point, clonazepam is effective but use cautiously in older adults or those with OSA or gait instability, pramipexole is reasonable especially if PLMS are present, and rivastigmine is the preferred cholinesterase inhibitor when MCI or PD are present and symptoms persist despite standard therapy [^c216a435] [^7fbfbdfb] [^8f721470]. Third, if response is inadequate, consider combination therapy such as clonazepam plus melatonin, and in refractory cases, discuss off-label options like sodium oxybate with shared decision-making and close monitoring, acknowledging the weak evidence base [^b0a41ac5] [^7ed5571f]. I should confirm that I am aligning with the conditional nature of these recommendations and documenting the rationale for each step [^2f3d3fe9].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and future directions. The field lacks large, high-quality RCTs for RBD treatments, and recent placebo-controlled trials have challenged the magnitude of benefit seen with clonazepam and melatonin, underscoring the need for better outcome measures and study designs; patients should be informed that our current choices are based on limited certainty and that ongoing research may refine recommendations [^8a809757] [^14b274fe]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any agent being definitively superior; until head-to-head trials exist, individualized trials with careful monitoring and safety prioritization remain the most evidence-aligned strategy [^c216a435].

Pramipexole and donepezil are **not first-line** for RBD; consider them only when clonazepam or melatonin are ineffective or contraindicated. Pramipexole may help when RBD coexists with periodic limb movements, but evidence is limited and mixed [^6866a415] [^825c622a]. Donepezil is **not recommended** for RBD due to insufficient evidence and potential to worsen symptoms. If used, start pramipexole at 0.125 mg nightly and titrate slowly to 0.5–1 mg, monitoring for sleepiness, impulse-control issues, and orthostatic hypotension [^7fbfbdfb] [^f2d01365]. Prioritize safety modifications and use the lowest effective dose with close follow-up [^96c667fb] [^02d5b429].

## Mechanisms of action relevant to RBD

Key characteristics of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD):

- **Loss of REM atonia**: Pathophysiology involves loss of normal REM muscle atonia, allowing dream enactment [^10906f04].
- **Brainstem dysfunction**: Linked to alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration affecting brainstem REM sleep centers [^936892eb].
- **Dopaminergic and cholinergic systems**: Both systems modulate REM sleep and motor control, though RBD is not purely dopaminergic [^7fbfbdfb].

---

### Pramipexole

Pramipexole is a **dopamine agonist** (D2/D3) used for Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome [^078b1502]. Its mechanism in RBD is uncertain; potential benefits may reflect reduced periodic limb movements or improved sleep consolidation rather than direct restoration of REM atonia [^7fbfbdfb].

---

### Donepezil

Donepezil is a **cholinesterase inhibitor** that increases acetylcholine and is used for Alzheimer's disease. It is not guideline-recommended for RBD, and evidence for efficacy is lacking; theoretical benefits via cholinergic enhancement are unproven in RBD [^c216a435].

---

## Clinical evidence for pramipexole in RBD

- **Evidence quality**: Low; based on small observational studies and case series, not RCTs [^6866a415] [^825c622a].
- **Findings**: Some studies report reduced dream enactment frequency/severity, but results are inconsistent and mechanism remains unclear [^2671db39] [^825c622a].
- **AASM 2023**: Conditionally suggests pramipexole for isolated RBD, especially with elevated PLMS on PSG; evidence certainty is very low [^c216a435] [^6866a415].

---

## Clinical evidence for donepezil in RBD

Evidence for donepezil in RBD is **limited to case reports and small series**, with no robust trials; overall, it is insufficient to support use. No major guideline recommends donepezil for RBD, and it is not included in AASM 2023 recommendations [^c216a435].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **First-line**: Clonazepam and immediate-release melatonin remain first-line for isolated and secondary RBD [^c216a435] [^7e82a292].
- **Pramipexole**: Consider only when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated, particularly with coexisting PLMS; use with caution [^c216a435] [^6866a415].
- **Donepezil**: Not recommended for RBD due to insufficient evidence [^c216a435].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Prefer pramipexole in younger patients with isolated RBD and prominent PLMS; avoid in older adults with fall risk, cognitive impairment, or psychiatric comorbidity [^7fbfbdfb].
- **Dosing**: Start pramipexole at 0.125 mg nightly, titrate slowly to 0.5–1 mg; monitor for sleepiness, impulse-control issues, and orthostasis [^7fbfbdfb] [^f2d01365].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess efficacy and adverse effects regularly; prioritize safety modifications (bedroom safety, separate sleeping if needed) [^96c667fb] [^0c6461db].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pramipexole | Conditional use | Low | - Consider if clonazepam/melatonin ineffective <br/> - Especially with PLMS <br/> - Monitor for sleepiness, ICDs, orthostasis |
| Donepezil | Not recommended | Very low | - Insufficient evidence <br/> - Potential adverse effects <br/> - Avoid routine use |

---

Pramipexole may be considered for RBD when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, especially with coexisting PLMS, but evidence is limited and mixed; use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring. Donepezil is **not recommended** for RBD due to insufficient evidence.

### REM sleep behavior disorder in PD treated with sodium oxybate… [^7ed5571f]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by altered dream mentation, vocalizations, and dream enactment behavior. The motor behavior is often aggressive, resulting in potential injury to the patient or bed partner. Clonazepam and melatonin are considered standard treatments. Limited data exist on the use of alternative agents when standard medications fail. We report a case of successfully treated RBD in advanced Parkinson disease with sodium oxybate in a patient refractory to both standard and alternative pharmacologic agents. Violent behaviors persisted despite treatment with standard agents. The patient's maximum tolerated dose of clonazepam was 1 mg, as higher doses resulted in drowsiness. The addition of melatonin, titrated to 12 mg, also failed to control symptoms.

Prazosin, ramelteon, cyproheptadine, and eszopiclone were subsequently added. Dosing was titrated to 2. 5 g twice nightly, which was based on a case report1 and guidelines for treatment of RBD. 2 Treatment with sodium oxybate resulted in complete cessation of DEB episodes for 2 months, representing a reduction from the patient's previous frequency of nearly every other night. The Stanford University institutional review board determined that this project did not meet the federal definition of research with human participants, and institutional review board approval was not required. Discussion. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by DEB, which can result in injury. Limited data exist on the use of alternative agents when standard medications fail in both idiopathic RBD and RBD with PD. Prazosin, an α1-adrenergic antagonist, has documented efficacy in patients with posttraumatic nightmares and disruptive nocturnal behaviors.

3, 4 In one case report of refractory idiopathic RBD, sodium oxybate effectively controlled dream-enactment behavior, with sustained improvement during 12 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient with advanced PD and severe refractory RBD treated safely and successfully with sodium oxybate. While the exact mechanism by which sodium oxybate suppresses RBD is unclear, this medication may be of benefit to a patient with refractory RBD at risk for serious injuries. The findings from this observation and previous studies suggest the importance of future research to examine the potential therapeutic role of sodium oxybate in PD and RBD.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^bb62c041]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — definition, course, and addressed agents: Patients with isolated RBD have an emergence of dream enactment, along with a PSG-documented elevation in REM sleep motor tone, in the absence of a clear underlying disorder or inciting substance or medication. Because the natural history of RBD is typically relentless and lifelong, patients with isolated RBD can be expected to require treatment for years to decades. Head-to-head studies comparing their effectiveness have not been performed; and We are making conditional recommendations for the use of 4 agents in the treatment of isolated RBD: clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, pramipexole, and rivastigmine.

Pramipexole for isolated RBD — role, uncertainties, and dosing: Pramipexole is a dopaminergic agonist typically used to treat the motor symptoms of PD, RLS, and periodic limb movement disorder. Its mechanism of efficacy in RBD is uncertain because RBD is not caused by dopaminergic dysfunction. Note that patients with RBD who respond to pramipexole often have increased periodic limb movements on PSG; thus, it is possible that pramipexole helps reduce ancillary motor activity. Conversely, pramipexole may reduce dream enactment by treating an underlying sleep-fragmenting condition, periodic limb movement disorder. Dosing typically starts at 0.125 mg administered orally at bedtime and can be increased, slowly, to 2.0 mg nightly.

### Pramipexole in the treatment of REM sleep behaviour disorder: a critical review [^825c622a]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

While widely accepted as a first-line treatment for rapid eye movement sleep (REM) behaviour disorder, clonazepam (CNZP) has side effects that limit its applicability. Pramipexole is a possible alternative, but limited literature on its effectiveness exists. This review aims to summarize the available data on the use of pramipexole in REM sleep behaviour disorder. A systematic search of major databases was conducted to look for published and on-going trials. This search yielded a total of five articles, all of which are observational in nature. Factors associated with effectiveness include low doses (less than 1.5mg/day) and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder/absence of neurodegenerative disease. Overall, the evidence is inconclusive. This is due to the lack of randomised controlled trials and the challenges in interpreting polysomgraphy findings in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Suggestions are given on how future trials evaluating pramipexole treatment in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder could overcome current methodological issues in extant literature.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^6866a415]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pramipexole for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — The AASM suggests that clinicians use pramipexole (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL). The TF identified 7 observational studies assessing the efficacy of pramipexole in patients with isolated RBD, which demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD frequency and simple/complex motor behavior frequency. The TF stated that the overall certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision and the risk of bias associated with observational studies, with commonly reported adverse events including next-day hangover, gastrointestinal symptoms, and negative impulse behavior; in addition, the use of daily pramipexole in individuals with restless legs syndrome (RLS) can result in the augmentation of RLS symptoms over time. The TF determined that the benefits of pramipexole use in patients outweighed the risks and adverse events and that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects was in favor of pramipexole, noted that the costs of the medication are relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep, and that the majority of patients would most likely use pramipexole compared to no treatment for their isolated RBD. Remarks note that pramipexole appears to be most effective among patients with RBD with elevated periodic limb movements noted on polysomnography (PSG), suggesting that its efficacy may be secondary to addressing ancillary motor activity.

Alternative treatments for RBD

Eleven other prospective studies were identified that tested the effect of alternative treatments for RBD (see Table 1), including two RCTs on a cholinesterase inhibitor (rivastigmine), one RCT on a glutamatergic antagonist (memantine), two open-label studies on a melatonin-agonist (ramelteon), five open-label studies on dopamine-agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine), and one open-label study on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine). The existing evidence for all other alternative drugs trialed to reduce RBD is based solely on retrospective accounts and case reports (see Table 3). The evidence on the effectiveness of all the alternative treatments for RBD is described in the S upplementary materials. Given the lack of robust evidence, to date none of these pharmacological agents can be recommended as first-line treatment options for RBD.

### New guideline for the treatment of dementia… [^05d80fbd]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

3 It addresses five medications; it does not address other medications used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are often associated with dementia. No medications are currently approved for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms.
4. Physicians should base the decision to initiate pharmacologic therapy on an individualized assessment of potential risks and benefits. Four of the agents considered are cholinesterase inhibitors. Excluding tacrine, which has a worse side-effect profile, there were no significant differences among rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil. 2, 3 The other agent considered, memantine, acts to limit stimulation of the glutamate system. Its effectiveness has been tested primarily in patients with moderate to severe dementia, and it is approved for those patients.

Patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have statistically significant improvements in cognitive function, but on average, the benefits are not clinically significant for cognition and are only modest for global assessments. A guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in Great Britain, published in November 2006, reached similar conclusions about medication effectiveness. 5 In addition, there was no solid evidence that the currently available medications increase quality of life, delay institutionalization, or treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia. NICE recommends consideration of cholinesterase inhibitors only in patients with moderate dementia, and does not recommend the use of memantine outside research studies. So, how should family physicians treat dementia in light of this new guideline.

It seems reasonable to discuss the risks and benefits of a trial of one of the currently available cholinesterase inhibitors to all persons diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Use of memantine may also be suitable in patients with moderate cognitive impairment. The patient's status should be closely monitored for the effectiveness of the treatment. In addition to the physician's own assessment of the patient, the observations of the patient and family should be included in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. A standardized measure of cognitive function, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination.

Secondary RBD due to a medical condition — definition and conditional guidance — includes underlying disorder associations and recommended therapies. Patients with secondary RBD have an emergence of dream enactment with PSG-documented elevation in REM sleep motor tone in the presence of a clear underlying disorder, most commonly an alpha-synuclein disorder such as dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease, or type I narcolepsy, and in DLB/PD it is more likely in older patients (> 50 years old). The guideline states, We are making conditional recommendations for the use of 3 agents in the treatment of secondary RBD: clonazepam, immediate-release melatonin, and rivastigmine, and also chose to make a conditional recommendation against the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for secondary RBD; targeting subthalamic or globus pallidus interna regions has not demonstrated improved dream enactment control in PD with RBD. Several disease-targeted treatments did not meet the threshold for recommendation but may be considered in appropriate clinical contexts rather than solely for RBD.

Summary Of Recommendations

Modifying the sleep environment is recommended for the treatment of patients with RBD who have sleep-related injury. Level A Clonazepam is suggested for the treatment of RBD but should be used with caution in patients with dementia, gait disorders, or concomitant OSA. Its use should be monitored carefully over time as RBD appears to be a precursor to neurodegenerative disorders with dementia in some patients. Level B Clonazepam is suggested to decrease the occurrence of sleep-related injury caused by RBD in patients for whom pharmacologic therapy is deemed necessary. It should be used in caution in patients with dementia, gait disorders, or concomitant OSA, and its use should be monitored carefully over time. Level B Melatonin is suggested for the treatment of RBD with the advantage that there are few side effects. Level B Pramipexole may be considered to treat RBD, but efficacy studies have shown contradictory results. There is little evidence to support the use of paroxetine or L-DOPA to treat RBD, and some studies have suggested that these drugs may actually induce or exacerbate RBD. There are limited data regarding the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, but they may be considered to treat RBD in patients with a concomitant synucleinopathy. Level C.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^cfefe672]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the widespread use of both clonazepam and melatonin for treating RBD, until recently there was a lack of good quality trial data. Current international guidelines are still based on evidence from mainly small case-series and open-label studies, which are at high risk of bias and have demonstrated inconsistencies in the clinical effectiveness levels reported. In fact, many patients with RBD were considered refractory to these first-line treatment options, which led clinicians to trial a multitude of other pharmacological agents off-label. Past reviews have not consistently accounted for such reports when calculating the number of responders for these commonly prescribed treatments, or were conducted more than 10 years ago. Thus, there is a need to re-assess whether the existing evidence supports the current recommended guidelines for the pharmacological management of RBD.

The purpose of this update is to provide a semi-systematic overview of all clinical and scientific evidence published to date on the pharmacological management of RBD. We focus on the middle- to older (50 years and above) adult population, which has the highest prevalence of RBD as well as being at the greatest risk for adverse outcomes. Doing so, we set out to provide an update on the total number of adults with isolated or secondary RBD who were clinically followed to assess the efficacy of any pharmacological compound given to treat their RBD symptoms. We also assessed the level of evidence based on the study design, as depicted in Box 1. This review specifically investigates the divide between clinical expectancy and the actual evidence for the effectiveness of the common drugs being recommended for managing RBD. We also seek to provide future directions on how this field could move to a more rigorous evidence-base.

Another important consideration for future studies is the timing of patient enrollment. Indeed, patients are often enrolled upon first referral to the sleep clinic after they have experienced a period with troublesome RBD symptoms. Given the variability of RBD over time, enrollment into a clinical trial during such a period of high RBD severity might result in a regression towards the mean over time, unrelated to the treatment effect. As such, and if clinically ethical to temporarily withhold possibly effective treatment, we recommend future studies to implement an observation period prior to randomization to assess the natural variability in RBD symptom severity, resulting in better statistical power.

A possible limitation of the present review is that we included studies that assessed patients with probable RBD, whose diagnoses were not confirmed by PSG. We also interpreted the clinical effects across all patients with RBD. Future work is needed to determine whether pharmacological effects differ across patient populations, for instance secondary vs. isolated RBD.

Publication bias assessment

To assess for possible publication bias, another search was conducted on 20 November 2020 in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organisation (apps.who.com), which encompasses many of the trial registries around the world, including ClinicalTrials.gov. We used the search terms ('REM sleep behavior disorder' OR 'RBD'), which led to a total of 77 listed trials that were screened according to the same inclusion criteria as described above, except criteria v and vi. A total of 17 trials were deemed eligible and assessed for possible publication bias.

Drug-induced/exacerbated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — conditional discontinuation, diagnosis, and antidepressant strategy are specified: "drug-induced/exacerbated RBD is the most common etiology for RBD in patients younger than age 50 years", and the panel makes "a conditional recommendation for drug discontinuation in drug-induced/exacerbated RBD if it is safe to do so". If dream enactment persists after stopping the inciting agent, the guideline states "we recommend diagnosing the patients with either isolated RBD or secondary RBD (if there is a clear underlying disorder) and treating accordingly", noting that reducing or stopping a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor "may take several months" for improvement and that RBD after an inciting agent may emerge within "weeks or months, not years". For those still needing antidepressants, it notes "many do well on an agent with a lower serotonergic profile such as bupropion", and advises "The risks and benefits of discontinuing a drug known to induce RBD that has been taken uneventfully for a prolonged period of time should be carefully assessed".

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RBD: It is critically important to help patients maintain a safe sleeping environment to prevent potentially injurious nocturnal behaviors. In particular, the removal of bedside weapons, or objects that could inflict injury if thrown or wielded against a bed partner, is of paramount importance. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved away or their edges and headboard should be padded. To reduce the risk of injurious falls, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed. Patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from their partners, or at the minimum, to place a pillow between themselves and their partners.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, with medications listed in alphabetical order, are a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RBD in adults. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

Adult patients with isolated RBD.

1. The AASM suggests that clinicians use clonazepam (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

2. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use immediate-release melatonin (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

3. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use pramipexole (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

4. The AASM suggests that clinicians use transdermal rivastigmine (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults with mild cognitive impairment. (CONDITIONAL).

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) pharmacologic management in older and neurodegenerative populations — clonazepam, melatonin, and rivastigmine — includes safety and dosing considerations. Concerning side effects of clonazepam include morning sedation, gait imbalance/falls, depression, and cognitive disturbances, and clonazepam can also exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing; among patients with secondary RBD and DLB or PD, clonazepam is often used in lower doses, starting at 0.25 mg, and dose requirements may decrease with aging, for example from 1.0 mg at age 55 years to 0.5 mg at age 70 years. Melatonin is an intriguing option for older patients (> 50 years old) because it is only mildly sedating, with dosing starting with 3 mg and increasing by 3-mg increments to 15 mg. Rivastigmine is typically administered by transdermal patch with dosing that starts at 4.6 mg applied every 24 hours and can increase to 13.3 mg daily, and adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, bradycardia, and possible excessive daytime sleepiness in secondary RBD.

Prognosis and counseling in isolated RBD — risk stratification, disclosure approaches, and resources are detailed: "We believe clinicians should, if the patient desires, tactfully and explicitly discuss the relationship and provide the patient with a customized risk assessment". Chronic alpha-synuclein–linked symptoms coexisting with RBD "are strong predictors of phenoconversion in less than 5 years", whereas their absence with a serotonergic antidepressant "is associated with a lower risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder in the next 5 years". Pending guidance, the task force presents "2 general approaches… based upon the TF's unanimous consensus: patient-centered risk disclosure and watchful waiting". After diagnosis, "the provider should explore the patient's knowledge about isolated RBD", and "Clinicians should present the literature fairly and in plain language", while offering research connections to groups "such as the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy consortium", "the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative", and "the International RBD Study Group". The document notes "The watchful waiting approach… may be appropriate… in the setting of severe, active psychiatric illness", and "we suggest the American Academy of Neurology's position statement, 'Ethical Considerations in Dementia Diagnosis and Care'.

Study designs

As shown in Fig. 2, the large majority of included studies were case reports (CR, n = 51) or retrospective accounts based on medical histories (RMH, n = 21). Only 7 studies had a single-centered randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) design and 13 were prospectively planned single arm open-label (i.e. without a control intervention) cohort studies (POS). Overall, the bulk of evidence that currently exists on the pharmacological management of RBD in the adult population is, therefore, considered to be of poor scientific quality (Box 1).

First-line treatment options

Clonazepam

Amalgamating all clinical accounts suggested that 684 (66.7%) out of a total of 1026 RBD patients (regardless of aetiology) reported clear benefits following clonazepam mono-therapy with no troublesome side effects noted by the authors for the duration of the trial. A further 159 (15.5%) reported partial improvements with some residual RBD symptoms or manageable side effects occurring, while a total of 183 (17.8%) of RBD patients were considered refractory, experiencing intolerable side effects or showing no sustained reduction of their RBD for the duration of the trial. This update is based on the clinical reports from 1 RCT, 3 prospective observational studies (POS), 16 retrospective medical histories (RMH), and 31 case reports (CR). The patients across these studies represented a mixture of iRBD and secondary RBD with comorbid conditions (Table S1).

When clonazepam mono-therapy proved ineffective, clinicians often resolved to trial in their case series a combination of clonazepam with one or multiple other pharmacological agents, as the second treatment option. A total of 13 RBD patients were reported to receive a combination of clonazepam plus melatonin treatment, with 3 (23.1%) experiencing clear improvements, 6 (46.1%) partial improvements and 4 (30.8%) reporting no benefits (Table S2). Out of a total 69 RBD patients treated with clonazepam plus add-on therapies other than melatonin, such as carbamazepine, pramipexole, etc. 41 (59.4%) reported clear benefits, 3 (4.4%) partial benefits, while 25 (36.2%) experienced no benefits (Table S3).

Establishing expectations in RBD — education, safety, and monitoring are emphasized: "Patients and bed partners should know that dream enactment is a neurological disorder that can start during any phase of the night. It may occur every night or infrequently", and "Degree of injury, rather than vocalization or intensity of movement, determines the extent of harm". When dream enactment is noninjurious, "escalating pharmacotherapy is usually unwarranted" because more aggressive or sedating therapy "is often futile and dangerous, increasing the risk of nighttime falls and daytime sleepiness". The guideline adds that "ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the severity of dream enactment and treatment efficacy and to explore whether bed partners should be sleeping separately".

### Update on the pharmacology of REM sleep behavior disorder [^f702725d]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by complex behavioral manifestations in response to dream content that may cause sleep disruption or injuries to the patient or the bed partner. In this case, the patients need treatment to control their symptoms. Pharmacologic agents have been reported to have positive and negative impacts on REM sleep muscle atonia and the motor behaviors associated with RBD. Clonazepam is efficacious and well tolerated by the majority of patients afflicted by RBD and should be considered as initial treatment. In patients at risk of falls who have cognitive impairment or who have obstructive sleep apneas, melatonin may be a good alternative to clonazepam. Anticholinesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic agents are not of clear benefit. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic synaptic reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD. When these agents are prescribed to patients with neurodegenerative disorders or narcolepsy who are at risk of developing RBD, systematic follow-up may be warranted to detect the emergence of RBD symptoms.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) clinical practice guideline — secondary REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) due to a medical condition (PD) in adults, rivastigmine: The AASM suggests that clinicians use transdermal rivastigmine (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to a medical condition (PD) in adults. (CONDITIONAL). The task force (TF) identified 1 randomized controlled trial testing transdermal rivastigmine that demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD episode frequency, and the overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to imprecision. Reported adverse events with rivastigmine included hypotension and asthenia leading to withdrawal and commonly daytime sleepiness and nausea. Based on clinical expertise, the TF determined that benefits outweighed risks with a balance of effects favoring rivastigmine, and noted costs may be higher than clonazepam or melatonin but relatively small compared to no treatment.

Conclusion

The best current evidence base for pharmacotherapies for RDB could charitably be described as being of an I-b level (Box 1). Based on lower levels of evidence, the traditionally claimed effectiveness of the two first-line therapies for RBD (melatonin and clonazepam) may be greatly overestimated. The clinically observed effectiveness of these interventions may have been driven by strong placebo effects, regression towards the mean, and the non-specific but laudable effects of good clinical practice in RBD, such as behavioral advice. Concerns continue to exist about the ability of any outcome measure to accurately and objectively capture RBD severity in an unbiased manner. Thus there is a clear need to conduct more robustly designed and adequately powered double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs using better outcome measures on appropriately selected patient groups. Patient-centered diary outcomes are currently recommended for larger phase 3 trials and following validation, objective RBD as measured by home-based PSG over multiple nights is suggested as the most promising primary endpoint for future earlier phase RCTs on RBD.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) safety — environmental risk mitigation and when to escalate: Sleeping safely is challenging in RBD, as any patient can intermittently have violent episodes of dream enactment. Of paramount importance is the removal of loaded firearms and in particular handguns, as they can be discharged during a dream enactment episode. When violent dream enactment persists despite these interventions or in situations with a high risk for injury, pharmacotherapy can be considered.

### Pramipexole in psychiatry: a systematic review of the literature [^6bc8e9d3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the risks and benefits of pramipexole in psychiatric populations.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was performed using the keywords pramipexole and ropinirole, which identified 500 articles.

Study Selection

All clinical studies in psychiatric populations were included in the primary review (24 articles). Studies involving other populations were then reviewed to evaluate potential risks and benefits not identified in the psychiatric studies.

Data Extraction

Effect sizes were calculated from controlled studies. Rates of intolerable side effects and manic switching were estimated by pooled analysis of controlled and uncontrolled studies.

Data Synthesis

Pramipexole has a large effect size (0.6–1.1) in the treatment of both bipolar and unipolar depression with a low short-term rate of manic switching in bipolar patients (1% mania, 5% hypomania). The pooled discontinuation rate for all reasons was 9%. Pramipexole is neuroprotective and exerts beneficial effects on sleep architecture. Pramipexole is associated with 3 rare but serious side effects: sleep attacks, which have only occurred in Parkinson's disease; compulsive behaviors and pathologic gambling, which have occurred in Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome; and psychosis, which has occurred in both psychiatric and neurologic populations.

Conclusions

Pramipexole is an important therapeutic option for treatment-resistant bipolar and unipolar depression; further studies are warranted to evaluate its safety in psychiatric patients.

Future directions

Our interpretation of the totality of treatment evidence in RBD is that the presumed effectiveness of the two mainstay treatments may be largely or wholly attributable to the non-specific effects of good clinical care, placebo effects, and regression to the mean. As such, it should be a pressing priority in the field today to ascertain how effective the mainstay treatments for symptomatic alleviation truly are. It is time to conduct robustly designed and properly powered and blinded, placebo-controlled parallel group RCTs using outcome measures that are free from interpretation bias.

One of the challenges has been the development of an accurate primary outcome measure of true RBD burden that is specific to RBD and free from subjective interpretation. Actigraphy outcomes have been proposed as an objective outcome for RBD, but with actigraphy alone it is impossible to ascertain whether the patient is truly in REM sleep when movements are detected. Similarly, automated 3D video analysis of leg movements during REM sleep, in particular short jerks of 0.1–2.0 s, as captured with a Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor using infrared camera's was recently shown to be able to accurately (90.4%) distinguish iRBD patients from prodromal RBD and patients with other sleep disorders and leg movements. The number of leg jerks documented with this automated system during REM sleep correlated strongly with RWA and visually scored leg movements. PSG, however, was still required to score REM sleep, in particular as low classification accuracies were reported for non-REM sleep periods. In effect, currently only PSG can objectively detect the presence, frequency and severity of RBD. To date, several RCTs and prospective open-label studies already rated dream enactment behaviors and/or RWA on PSG as an outcome of their intervention with many of these showing no differences (Table 1). However, gold-standard PSG requires an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory, which is costly and involves travel for the patient. A laboratory environment may also be an unfavorable setting for patients to achieve typical sleep, possibly having an impact on the amount of REM sleep. Finally, RBD can be highly variable across nights. As a result, a single night of laboratory PSG may not provide an adequate representation of RBD frequency and severity and this may have precluded past studies from detecting a favorable treatment effect.

Outcomes used

Choosing a primary outcome measure for RBD is challenging. The large majority of studies identified by this literature review relied on subjective recollections from the patient and/or their bed partners to assess the effectiveness of RBD treatments. The 7-point ordinal CGI scale was the most frequently used measure of a clinically evident effect and in some cases a customized scale was devised, such as a three- or four-point ordinal RBD severity rating based on clinical opinion or a VAS scale completed by the bed-partners. However, baseline expectations on the presumed effectiveness of the intervention, as would be the case for first-line treatment options for RBD, create a high risk for bias. Clinical opinions are also at high risk of being influenced by placebo effects, if not controlled for in a double-blinded manner. Furthermore, retrospective recollections of symptom severity can be heavily driven by the occurrence of a single severe event, which may have been an 'oddball', rather than an average of all events. Biased recollection may be exacerbated in those RBD patients with memory difficulties, such as those with DLB and PD dementia. People may also struggle to remember whether the RBD events occurred during or outside of the intervention period. Finally, patients with other symptoms besides RBD, for example such as is the case for PD and DLB patients, may report benefits to their clinician after receiving treatment for their RBD, as at that time their desire to resolve RBD may be overshadowed by the desire to resolve some other symptom that may still go untreated. Importantly, all RCTs conducted to date on first-line treatments for RBD included the CGI as either the primary or as a secondary outcome. This ordinal scale makes it difficult to show differences in the small samples that have been studied. Indeed, only one of the RCTs could report a minor improvement on the CGI following the active intervention, whereas the three other double-blinded RCTs showed no benefits compared to placebo. While RBD-related questionnaires are useful to screen for the presence of probable RBD, of the questionnaires used by the included RCTs and POS studies only the RBDQ-HK and its Korean version (RBD-KR) were developed to assess RBD severity. As such, the RBDQ-HK or RBDQ-KR was used as either a primary or secondary outcome in three prospective intervention studies. However, RBD-related questionnaires, such as the RBDQ-HK, also rely on subjective retrospective recollections of RBD severity by patients and their bed-partners, questioning their accuracy. Taken together, we would not recommend the exclusive use of subjective retrospective accounts for assessing the efficacy of any RBD intervention in routine clinical practice. The use of CGI should be coupled with sufficient sample sizes to detect meaningful differences in ordinal data and a good randomized double-blinded control (probably placebo at this point).

Table 3 presents a summary report of the updated total number of responders per pharmacological intervention trialed for treating RBD. Patients were considered full responders if the authors reported clear and sustained improvements for the duration of the trial without troublesome side effects or classified the patients as full responders, often because of > 50% symptom reduction (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score = (very) much improved); as partial responders if the authors reported improvements, but with some RBD symptoms remaining or some minimally troublesome side-effects occurring (CGI-I score = minimally improved); and as non-responders if the authors reported no sustained improvements for the duration of the trial, classified the patients as non-responders, or the treatment had to be discontinued due to troublesome side-effects (CGI-I score = no change, or worse). An overview of the data underlying Table 3 listing all clinical interpretations on the efficacy for each drug and dosage used to treat RBD in the adult population per study is presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S28. A description of the existing evidence for clonazepam and melatonin as the current first-line treatment options is provided below, and a description of the evidence for all other alternative drugs trialed to treat RBD off-label is provided in the Supplementary materials.

### Treatment of the sleep disorders associated with Parkinson's disease [^69b5ca21]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and preliminary work has suggested viable treatment options for many of these disorders. For rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, melatonin and clonazepam are most commonly used, while rivastigmine might be a useful option in patients whose behaviors are refractory to the former. Optimal treatments for insomnia in PD have yet to be determined, but preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy, light therapy, eszopiclone, donepezil, and melatonin might be beneficial. Use of the wake-promoting agent modafinil results in significant improvement in subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness, but not of fatigue. Optimal treatment of restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea in PD are not yet established, although a trial of continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea was recently completed in PD patients. In those patients with early morning motor dysfunction and disrupted sleep, the rotigotine patch provides significant benefit.

### Neuroprotective trials in REM sleep behavior disorder: the way forward becomes clearer [^41412f5d]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

As neuroprotective therapies continue to be advanced against neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs), and multiple system atrophy, increasing attention is turning to the prodromal stages of disease. Treatments at the prodromal stage have the compelling advantages of being applied early enough to make a meaningful difference and can be tested without confounding by symptomatic therapies used for clinical PD/DLB. As it currently stands, patients with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) represent the only large existing cohort of untreated prodromal PD/DLB that would be ready to start a clinical trial now. Several thousand patients with RBD are currently being followed in research-based clinics, and more than 80% of them will develop a full neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. Research into RBD phenoconversion rates and predictors has advanced considerably, and we are now able to generate increasingly precise estimates of progression rates, can select stratification markers to enrich trials, and are able to understand the progression and sample size implications of different primary outcome measures. This review will outline the potential for neuroprotective trials in iRBD, including the pathophysiologic mechanisms with the most promise to target in iRBD, selection criteria for inclusion, and the optimal primary trial outcome measures to choose.

### The many faces of REM sleep behavior disorder. providing evidence for a new lexicon [^8974ec6d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on this evidence, we suggest launching an international initiative involving the International RBD Study Group (IRBDSG), international neurological and sleep societies, and relevant stakeholders to define a new lexicon for people with a polysomnography‐confirmed diagnosis of RBD, incorporating relevant biomarkers to clearly define the underlying etiologies of the disease. This initiative may allow us to clearly differentiate RBD due to alpha‐synucleinopathy from RBD due to other etiologies, such as narcolepsy and brainstem lesions, by identifying the biomarkers that should be used, as well as their manner and timing of use. Moreover, a new lexicon may more explicitly identify people with an underlying neurodegenerative disorder, with relevant implications for the enrollment criteria in trials with disease‐modifying drugs, by clearly defining the target population. Indeed, polysomnography‐proven RBD due to alpha‐synucleinopathy is currently considered the best target for future disease‐modifying clinical trials.

Introduction

Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia, in which a loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep leads to dream enactment behaviors (DEB). A clinical history of DEB together with video-polysomnography (PSG) confirmed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), or a combination of RWA and dream-enactment behaviors documented with PSG, are mandatory for a clinical diagnosis of RBD according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-III. Although RBD symptoms can be seen in several disorders, such as narcolepsy-cataplexy and parasomnia overlap disorder, and may be precipitated by certain drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, its isolated presence in the general adult population is closely linked with alpha synuclein neuropathology and a future diagnosis of either Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). In the general population around 1% of people have clinically isolated RBD, whereas the proportion is much higher in PD (20–50%) and over 80% of DLB and MSA patients report RBD. People with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) frequently experience OSA-induced arousals that may result in movements during REM sleep mimicking RBD symptoms. Importantly, however, people with OSA can indeed have true RBD, which should be confirmed with PSG after treating the OSA.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: many causes, few therapeutic options [^aa6091bf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are frequent and have multifactorial and multilayered causes. Primary involvement of sleep/wake regulating centers in the brainstem, sleep problems caused by the nocturnal manifestation of motor and dysautonomic signs and medication-induced sleep problems are often impossible to disentangle in the individual patient. Two syndromes, hypersomnia and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are increasingly recognized as harbingers of the core PD motor syndrome. RBD, associated with a panoply of other nonmotor symptoms, may predispose to a specific PD phenotype. Long-acting dopaminergic stimulation, when abating nocturnal akinesia, also improves subjective sleep quantity. While this strategy is backed up by several randomized controlled trials (RCT), other treatment recommendations are mostly based on case series or expert opinion. Thus we identified only two other RCT, one treating insomnia with eszopiclone, the other nocturnal behavioral abnormalities in demented PD patients with memantine. While the causal complexity of sleep problems in PD certainly hampers the design of therapeutic studies, multiple general treatment strategies against sleep disorders can however be applied efficiently in PD patients as well.

### Current concepts and controversies in the management of REM sleep behavior disorder [^936892eb]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream enactment and the loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, known as REM sleep without atonia (RSWA). RBD can result in significant injuries, prompting patients to seek medical attention. However, in others, it may present only as non-violent behaviors noted as an incidental finding during polysomnography (PSG). RBD typically occurs in the context of synuclein-based neurodegenerative disorders but can also be seen accompanying brain lesions and be exacerbated by medications, particularly antidepressants. There is also an increasing appreciation regarding isolated or idiopathic RBD (iRBD). Symptomatic treatment of RBD is a priority to prevent injurious complications, with usual choices being melatonin or clonazepam. The discovery that iRBD represents a prodromal stage of incurable synucleinopathies has galvanized the research community into delineating the pathophysiology of RBD and defining biomarkers of neurodegeneration that will facilitate future disease-modifying trials in iRBD. Despite many advances, there has been no progress in available symptomatic or neuroprotective therapies for RBD, with recent negative trials highlighting several challenges that need to be addressed to prepare for definitive therapeutic trials for patients with this disorder. These challenges relate to i) the diagnostic and screening strategies applied to RBD, ii) the limited evidence base for symptomatic therapies, (iii) the existence of possible subtypes of RBD, (iv) the relevance of triggering medications, (v) the absence of objective markers of severity, (vi) the optimal design of disease-modifying trials, and vii) the implications around disclosing the risk of future neurodegeneration in otherwise healthy individuals. Here, we review the current concepts in the therapeutics of RBD as it relates to the above challenges and identify pertinent research questions to be addressed by future work.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^df6b0f89]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline for the management of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in adults and children. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of 7 experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies that addressed interventions for the management of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults and children. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical significance of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations. The literature search identified 4,690 studies; 148 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses; evidence for 45 interventions is presented. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence assessing the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

Melatonin

The clinical outcome of melatonin mono-therapy was reported for a total of 137 RBD patients, of whom 45 (32.9%) experienced clear benefits, 37 (27.0%) partial benefits and 55 (40.1%) no benefits (Table S7). This update is based on the clinical outcomes of 3 RCTs, 2 POS, 7 RMH, and 10 CRs. Of these, 100 patients were administered immediate release melatonin, with 34% reporting clear benefits, 31% partial benefits and 35% no benefits. A total of 37 patients were administered a prolonged-released formulation of melatonin (Circadin), with 11 (29.7%) reporting clear benefits, 6 (16.2%) partial benefits, and 20 (54.1%) no benefits. Most patients across these studies had secondary diagnoses besides RBD. A combination of melatonin plus an adjunctive therapy other than clonazepam was trialed in just three patients. One patient with iRBD plus palatal tremor with ataxia received melatonin plus ropinirole, which mildly improved RBD, and another patient with iRBD received melatonin plus pramipexole, which was unsuccessful until sodium oxybate was added leading to partial resolution of RBD (Table S8). One other iRBD patient received melatonin plus gabapentin, but the effectiveness was not reported.

Melatonin for isolated RBD — mechanism, dose, and availability: Melatonin binds to the M1 and M2 receptors, suppressing REM sleep motor tone and normalizing other circadian features of REM sleep. Melatonin dosing in isolated RBD is usually 3 mg taken at bedtime. Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement and is available over the counter in the United States and Canada. Melatonin requires a prescription in the European Union and the United Kingdom.

### Pharmacological treatment for REM sleep behavior disorder in parkinson disease and related conditions: a scoping review [^d2ee46e1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the presence of a complex of signals resulting from the loss of REM sleep atony and manifested by vigorous and sometimes violent motor jerks and nocturnal vocalizations associated with dream enactment. RBD might be a clinical predictor of severity for Parkinson's disease (PD) and one of its most important non-motor manifestations, preceding the emergence of synucleinopathy by several years or even decades. The detection of RBD may represent a therapeutic window for research regarding the development of new neuroprotective therapies with the potential to modify the natural course of synucleinopathies, such as PD. We performed a scoping review of studies indexed in MEDLINE and LILACS focusing on pharmacological interventions for RBD associated with PD. Fourteen articles were selected. Study designs comprised randomized and non-randomized clinical trials (n = 153 participants) and observational studies (retrospective cohorts and case series, n = 248 participants). Melatonin and clonazepam appear to be useful for treating RBD in PD, but these findings are mostly supported by observational studies and a few controlled studies with a small number of participants. New pharmacological agents, such as melatoninergic agonists and phytocannabinoids, appear to be promising therapies. The findings from studies focusing on anticholinesterases and new dopaminergic agents are still deemed inconclusive.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^14b274fe]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rapid Eye Movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia causing sufferers to physically act out their dreams. These behaviors can disrupt sleep and sometimes lead to injuries in patients and their bed-partners. Clonazepam and melatonin are the first-line pharmacological treatment options for RBD based on direct uncontrolled clinical observations and very limited double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Given the risk for adverse outcomes, especially in older adults, it is of great importance to assess the existing level of evidence for the use of these treatments. In this update, we therefore critically review the clinical and scientific evidence on the pharmacological management of RBD in people aged over 50. We focus on the first-line treatments, and provide an overview of all other alternative pharmacological agents trialed for RBD we could locate as supplementary materials. By amalgamating all clinical observations, our update shows that 66.7% of 1,026 RBD patients reported improvements from clonazepam and 32.9% of 137 RBD patients reported improvements from melatonin treatment on various outcome measures in published accounts. Recently, however, three relatively small randomized placebo-controlled trials did not find these agents to be superior to placebo. Given clonazepam and melatonin are clinically assumed to majorly modify or eliminate RBD in nearly all patients — there is an urgent need to test whether this magnitude of treatment effect remains intact in larger placebo-controlled trials.

Two of the recent RCTs on PR-melatonin implemented an RBD event diary as either the primary or as a secondary but unreported outcome. Such patient-centered measures of RBD frequency and severity might be good outcome measures in symptomatic RCTs as long as the subjects are fully blinded to the treatment allocation, and by filling out the diary each morning, there is presumably a reduced risk for recollection error. Diary outcomes measured continuously may thus provide a more sensitive representation of RBD clinical severity (i.e. severe enough and memorable enough to motivate a patient to actually seek clinical help), especially when the entries can be complemented by a bed-partner. We have found the diary seems to have good 'face' validity with patients accepting that it looks like it captures patient and bed partners' complaints. However, the patients themselves are asleep and often the bed-partners are too when RBD occurs, and as such, RBD events may be missed. Moreover, if RBD becomes disruptive of sleep and/or forms a risk for injuries, the bed-partners will often resolve to sleep in a separate room and many RBD patients do not have a bed-partner. Excluding subjects without a bed-partner sleeping in the same room will thus lead to a non-representative sample of the population. Finally, there is no way to control whether the entries provided are accurate. Based on our experience we recommend a training period for patients to learn to adequately complete such an outcome prior to randomization and provide patients with frequent reminders to keep filling out the diary as adequately as possible to prevent missing entries. In our trial such an approach resulted in 99% adherence for completing the primary outcome, ensuring adequate statistical power in the analysis.

Importantly, the outcomes of two RCTs that have been completed for over 2 years have also not been published, indicative of possible publication bias. One RCT completed in 2011 tested the effect of 8 mg ramelteon compared to a placebo over 30 nights, but to our knowledge the investigators have not posted nor published the trial results (NCT01401413). Another RCT completed in 2018 on the effect of 40–80 mg nelotanserin compared to placebo over 28 nights in RBD patients with dementia (DLB or PD) has also not been published in a peer-review journal, though the investigators of that trial did disseminate part of the results on the trial registry (NCT02708186). A total of 16 patients (all male) were randomized to receive nelotanserin, and 18 patients (13 males) were randomized to receive matched placebo for 28 days. Two patients in each group dropped-out. The primary outcome was the change in the number RBD events observed on a single night of PSG compared between baseline and post-treatment. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the least mean squares (standard error) for the nelotanserin group was − 1.47 (1.006) RBD events and for the Placebo group − 0.26 (1.027). It is not reported whether this finding represents a statistically significant effect. Nelotanserin was also associated with several adverse events. Given the limited amount of evidence, no recommendation can be made for the use of nelotanserin to treat RBD in patients with dementia. Taken together, there is some indication of possible publication bias for pharmacological interventions for RBD.

### REM density in Parkinson's disease: association with motor, cognitive, autonomic function, and dopaminergic medication [^495c9158]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Reduced REM density may already be evident in the early stages of PD, even before the initiation of dopaminergic treatment. This is supported by the comparable REM density values observed in drug-naïve patients and those not receiving evening slow-release dopaminergic medication, highlighting the impact of the neurodegenerative process on REM density reduction. Neurodegeneration may affect nocturnal motor control, often reflected by nocturnal hypokinesia. The administration of evening slow-release dopaminergic medications is prescribed to improve nocturnal motor control. Interestingly, REM density was higher in patients receiving slow-release dopaminergic medication, suggesting that the medications effect on motor control also improved REM density. In contrast, the effects of immediate-release medications may not last into the second half of the night, when REM sleep and REM density are more prominent. Furthermore, total LEDD was not correlated with REM density, aligning with our hypothesis that only evening-administered slow-release medications may influence REM expression, likely due to their pharmacokinetics and temporal proximity to REM-rich sleep periods.

The effect of dopaminergic medication on sleep is complex and depends on type, timing, and dosage. Low doses may act on presynaptic D2 receptors to promote sleep and reduce wakefulness, whereas higher doses may activate postsynaptic D1/D2 receptors, potentially disrupting sleep and increasing insomnia –. Nonetheless, dopaminergic therapies can alleviate sleep disturbances in PD, including insomnia, fragmentation, and motor-related disorders. Recent evidence links evening administration to improved sleep efficiency reduced WASO, and longer total sleep time. Given this variability, future studies should aim to identify patient-specific predictors of treatment response, such as disease stage, receptor sensitivity, or genetic factors, to guide personalized sleep interventions in PD.

There is a shortage of evidence on the effect of PD medication on REM density. Pramipexole treatment for RBD symptoms in iRBD patients caused a reduced REM density in one study, with no difference found in another study. In another small study, the administration of a rotigotine patch to 11 advanced PD patients with RBD did not affect REM density. Notably, most patients had already been receiving levodopa before the study. This could suggest that patients had reached a ceiling effect of the treatment before the introduction of rotigotine. Future research should establish the effects of multiple dopaminergic medications on REM density and explore how improvements in REM density influence motor and cognitive function.

### A systematic review of the literature on disorders of sleep and wakefulness in Parkinson's disease from 2005 to 2015 [^5debd62d]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant negative impact on quality of life. While sleep disorders in PD share most characteristics with those that occur in the general population, there are several considerations specific to this patient population regarding diagnosis, management, and implications. The available research on these disorders is expanding rapidly, but many questions remain unanswered. We thus conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2005 to 2015 on the following disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD: REM sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, nocturia, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm disorders. We discuss the epidemiology, etiology, clinical implications, associated features, evaluation measures, and management of these disorders. The influence on sleep of medications used in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD is detailed. Additionally, we suggest areas in need of further research.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^9322c755]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taken together, to date only three relatively small RCTs and two POS studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of melatonin for reducing RBD. Two of the parallel-group RCTs showed no improvements after melatonin and the third cross-over study, showed partial improvements compared to placebo. These studies thereby highlight the importance of a double-blinded assessment to preclude a seemingly strong placebo effect influencing both the patients and assessors. Importantly, there are much fewer concerns regarding side effects with melatonin compared to clonazepam and for that reason, melatonin is almost certainly a safer first-line treatment option for RBD, especially in the elderly. Based on the current scientific evidence, however, our prior assumption that melatonin has a marked clinical effect should be tempered by the observation of marked placebo and/or regression to the mean effects in placebo-controlled trials. Adequately powered RCTs will provide more precise estimates of the true treatment effect size, if any.

Reported harms included increased periodic limb movements in 2 patients and other adverse events such as depression, memory impairment, seizures, anxiety, agitation, confusion, dizziness, abnormal movements, pain at implant site, paresthesias, and hardware complications. The TF concluded the risks outweighed benefits and the balance of effects favored no treatment.

### Pharmacological treatment of parkinson disease: a review [^2ad5e753]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Although no available therapies alter the underlying neurodegenerative process, symptomatic therapies can improve patient quality of life.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based review of the initial pharmacological management of the classic motor symptoms of Parkinson disease; describe management of medication-related motor complications (such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesia), and other medication adverse effects (nausea, psychosis, and impulse control disorders and related behaviors); and discuss the management of selected nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson disease, including rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, cognitive impairment, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and sialorrhea.

Evidence Review

References were identified using searches of PubMed between January 1985 and February 2014 for English-language human studies and the full database of the Cochrane Library. The classification of studies by quality (classes I-IV) was assessed using the levels of evidence guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the highest-quality data for each topic.

Results

Although levodopa is the most effective medication available for treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, in certain instances (eg, mild symptoms, tremor as the only or most prominent symptom, aged < 60 years) other medications (eg, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors [MAOBIs], amantadine, anticholinergics, β-blockers, or dopamine agonists) may be initiated first to avoid levodopa-related motor complications. Motor fluctuations may be managed by modifying the levodopa dosing regimen or by adding several other medications, such as MAOBIs, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. Impulse control disorders are typically managed by reducing or withdrawing dopaminergic medication, particularly dopamine agonists. Evidence-based management of some nonmotor symptoms is limited by a paucity of high-quality positive studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Strong evidence supports using levodopa and dopamine agonists for motor symptoms at all stages of Parkinson disease. Dopamine agonists and drugs that block dopamine metabolism are effective for motor fluctuations and clozapine is effective for hallucinations. Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve symptoms of dementia and antidepressants and pramipexole may improve depression. Evidence supporting other therapies for motor and nonmotor features is less well established.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride [^f2d01365]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increasepramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.

5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension

Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's disease patients and RLS patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk.

In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy.

While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. Also, clinical trials in patients with RLS did not incorporate orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring done in close temporal proximity to dosing.

### Recommended treatment strategies for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness [^6dbf7a01]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common and bothersome phenomenon. It can be associated with insufficient sleep syndrome, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, or Parkinson's disease. Once the underlying cause of the excessive sleepiness is determined, clinicians must select the most appropriate behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to reduce daytime sleepiness, alleviate other symptoms, improve functioning, and ensure the safety of patients and those around them. Patient history, adverse effects, and efficacy in specific conditions should be considered in pharmacologic treatment options for patients with EDS.

Clonazepam for isolated RBD — mechanism, effects, dosing, and caution: As a long-acting benzodiazepine, clonazepam promotes GABAergic inhibition by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. Clonazepam reduces dream enactment, with only minimal reduction in REM sleep motor tone on PSG, and most patients initially respond well to low doses (0.25–1.0 mg) administered at bedtime; higher doses may be considered in the absence of response if well tolerated. Clonazepam is listed on the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list of potentially inappropriate medications in older adults.

### A pilot double-blind placebo-controlled trial of low-dose pramipexole in sleep-related eating disorder [^877ada31]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is characterized by recurrent arousals from sleep associated with compulsive ingestion of food. No controlled therapeutic trials are available for SRED. We assessed the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pramipexole, a dopamine D3-receptor agonist, in the treatment of SRED. Eleven consecutive patients with SRED in the absence of concurrent daytime eating disorders underwent actigraphic recording and subjective sleep diary evaluation for a week before and every week for 2 weeks of treatment with pramipexole 0.18–0.36 mg or placebo, administered in a double-blind crossover randomized sequence. The primary outcomes of the trial were actigraphic measures of night sleep parameters (sleep efficiency, motor activity mean and median, number and duration of wake episodes), secondary outcomes were the number of good sleep nights/weekly, number and duration of nocturnal awakenings/night, and visual analogue preference score. Pramipexole was well tolerated without any patient withdrawing from the study. Pramipexole reduced night-time activity median (P = 0.02) and increased the number of nights of good sleep/week (P = 0.02). All other measurements remained unaffected. Pramipexole at low doses was well tolerated, improving some measures of sleep quality and reducing median night activity in SRED. Further studies with higher dosages and for longer time-periods are warranted.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^fee35c4b]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although patients may not be aware of mild symptoms, treating RBD can often be necessary as it can cause frequent and sometimes life-threatening injuries to patients and their bed partners. The current guidelines for RBD treatment include counseling, modification of the bedroom environment to reduce the risk of injury and two main pharmacological agents, namely clonazepam and melatonin. Such information is also presented to patients via reputable online sources, such as sleepfoundation.org and websites of specialized sleep clinics.

Clonazepam has been the recommended treatment since the first clinical description of RBD by Schenck and colleagues back in 1986. Indeed, subsequent case series and open-label studies have reported a clinical efficacy rate of up to 90%. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine, which enhances inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity in the central nervous system leading to anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxation effects. It has been suggested that clonazepam may be efficacious by suppressing phasic bursts of muscle activity during REM sleep. However, the true mechanisms of action of clonazepam for reducing RBD remain unknown. Significantly, clonazepam is a long acting benzodiazepine with a half-life of 30–40 h that should be used with caution, especially in older adults, as it can lead to dependence along with frequent and sometimes serious side effects, including confusion, morning sedation, cognitive impairment and falls. Clonazepam may also induce or possibly worsen obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) symptoms. It is, therefore, critical to systematically assess whether the existing evidence supports the use of clonazepam to treat RBD, especially in the older population who are known to have the highest prevalence of RBD and in whom the adverse outcomes, such as falls, may be most impactful, particularly in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder such as PD or DLB.

6 Management Options for

Management of TRBD requires a comprehensive, evidence‐based approach tailored to its unique complexities. Before initiating TRBD‐specific interventions, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis using an operationalized definition, rule out contributing organic or medical comorbidities, and address co‐occurring psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or substance use disorders. Given the heightened risk of suicide in TRBD, clinicians must consider the most appropriate treatment setting and implement effective risk reduction strategies.

Pharmacological options for TRBD often involve combining mood stabilizers like lithium with lamotrigine, which has demonstrated efficacy in recent studies. Recent evidence shows that lithium has a critical role in reducing depression‐related hospitalizations, while antidepressant monotherapy not only fails to reduce the risk of depression‐related hospitalizations but is associated with a higher risk of mania‐related hospitalizations, offering important insights for managing TRBD. Other potential agents include modafinil, pramipexole, and tranylcypromine, which have shown benefits in smaller trials. The International College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CINP) guidelines recommend a treatment algorithm encompassing agents such as lithium plus lamotrigine, modafinil, or pramipexole, while evidence is inconclusive for other treatments. Adjunctive therapies, including N ‐acetylcysteine, omega‐3 fatty acids, and supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine, have shown promise in refractory or rapid cycling cases. Functional imaging studies suggest levothyroxine improves depressive symptoms by modulating anterior limbic network activity.

Non‐pharmacological treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remain a cornerstone for TRBD management, with superior response rates compared to algorithm‐based pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), including accelerated protocols, has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability.

Psychological and behavioral interventions are essential components of TRBD management, especially for their impact on functional outcomes and relapse prevention. Psychoeducation has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing medication adherence, reducing relapse rates, and improving quality of life in BD, although direct evidence for TRBD is limited. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) are effective in managing depressive episodes and stabilizing mood in BD and should be adapted for TRBD contexts. Additionally, lifestyle modifications — focusing on exercise, structured sleep hygiene, and stress management — are important adjuncts to pharmacological therapy.

### Prospects for pharmacological intervention in Alzheimer disease… [^91e63ddc]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Although at least 3 cholinesterase inhibitors are now available and provide patients with modest relief, the most promising strategy involves approaches to retarding, halting, or preventing the formation or accumulation of β-amyloid plaques. However, to date only the secondary degenerative effects have been amenable to therapy, as seen in the beneficial effects of cholinergic-boosting strategies. In addition to the 3 licensed compounds, there are many drugs awaiting approval or undergoing phase 3 trials., 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroacridine, Cognex; Parke-Davis, Morris Plains, NJ), donepezil, rivastigmine, physostigmine salicylate, and galantamine, or direct stimulation of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors with receptor agonists. However, tacrine and donepezil are the only drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Evidence now indicates that some AChE inhibitors also may provide neuroprotective effects, perhaps through the activation of nicotinic receptors, and may even enhance neurotrophic regeneration. Other possible actions include the effect of cholinergic agonists on the processing and secretion of the amyloid precursor protein and Aβ. 1, 2. In November 1996, donepezil was approved by the FDA as a symptomatic therapy for mild to moderate AD.

The bioavailability of donepezil is approximately 100%, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 4 hours after an oral dose. In a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled study22 with propentofylline in patients with AD and vascular dementia, the total patient population showed statistically significant treatment differences in favor of propentofylline for the global measures of dementia and cognitive evaluations. Propentofylline is awaiting registration in the European Union and Canada for use in mild to moderate AD and vascular dementia.

### Efficacy and safety of pramipexole in restless legs syndrome [^ace8b444]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pramipexole in patients with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) METHODS: The authors conducted a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fixed doses of pramipexole (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg/day). Patients (N = 344) were up-titrated to their randomized dose over 3 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were patient ratings of symptom severity on the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and clinician ratings of improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Secondary efficacy endpoints included visual analogue ratings of sleep and quality of life (QOL) RESULTS: By both primary measures, pramipexole was superior to placebo. For IRLS, the adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline to week 12 was -9.3 (1.0) for placebo, -12.8 (1.0) for 0.25 mg/day, -13.8 (1.0) for 0.50 mg/day, and -14.0 (1.0) for 0.75 mg/day (all p < 0.01). Similarly, pramipexole increased the percentage of patients with a CGI-I rating of "very much improved" or "much improved" at the end of the trial (51.2% for placebo and 74.7%, 67.9%, and 72.9% for pramipexole; all p < 0.05). Pramipexole significantly improved ratings of symptom severity, day and night, and also ratings of sleep satisfaction and QOL. Pramipexole was well tolerated: The most frequent adverse events with higher occurrence in the pramipexole group were nausea (19.0% vs 4.7%) and somnolence (10.1% vs 4.7%)

Conclusion

As rated by patients and by clinicians, pramipexole was efficacious and safe in reducing the symptoms of restless legs syndrome.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride (Mirapex) [^a0e0e752]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living

Patients treated with Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on MIRAPEX tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment.

Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving MIRAPEX tablets at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg TID) for Parkinson's disease. In controlled clinical trials in RLS, patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets at doses of 0.25–0.75 mg once a day, the incidence of somnolence was 6% compared to an incidence of 3% for placebo-treated patients (see ADVERSE EVENTS, Table 5). Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.

Before initiating treatment with MIRAPEX tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with MIRAPEX tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine - see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), MIRAPEX tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue MIRAPEX tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. While dose reduction clearly reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.
