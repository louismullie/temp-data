## Question

207. What angle does the diagonal of a square form with its side?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what angle the diagonal of a square forms with its side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and which angle we're actually measuring. Then, I should verify the simplest way to compute it using basic trigonometry. Next, I will consider an alternative approach using the properties of isosceles right triangles. Finally, I should double-check that both methods converge to the same answer and state the result clearly with justification.

> Let me first confirm the setup: in a square, the diagonal connects two opposite vertices, and the angle we want is the one between that diagonal and any adjacent side of the square, which is an acute angle at the corner where they meet. I need to ensure I'm not accidentally measuring the obtuse angle on the other side of the diagonal, because that would be the supplement of the correct angle.

> Now, I will use trigonometry on a right triangle formed by the side, the diagonal, and the adjacent side. If I let the side length be 1, then the diagonal is √2 by the Pythagorean theorem, and the angle θ between the side and the diagonal satisfies cos θ = adjacent over hypotenuse = 1/√2. Wait, let me verify the inverse cosine of 1/√2: that is indeed 45 degrees, so θ = 45°.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm this with a different approach. In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal and the angles opposite them are equal, and since the sum of angles is 180°, the two acute angles must each be 45°. The diagonal of a square splits the square into two congruent isosceles right triangles, so the angle between the diagonal and a side is 45° in each triangle. That matches the trigonometric result, which reassures me the answer is consistent.

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating this with other square-related angles that sometimes appear in the literature, like 30° or 90° references in different contexts. But wait, those are unrelated to the angle between a square's diagonal and its side; for example, 30° comes up in elliptical excision geometry or needle angulation techniques, and 90° is just the corner angle of the square itself, not the diagonal-to-side angle. So I need to keep the question tightly focused on the diagonal-to-side geometry to avoid misattribution.

> Final answer: The diagonal of a square forms a 45° angle with each of its sides. This follows from the right-triangle trigonometry where cos θ = 1/√2, and is corroborated by the isosceles-right-triangle property of the triangles formed by the diagonal.

The diagonal of a square forms a **45-degree angle** with each side. This is because the diagonal divides the square into two congruent isosceles right triangles, where the two equal angles are each 45° [^notfound]. This property is consistent across all squares regardless of size, as the angle depends only on the square's geometry, not its scale [^notfound].

## Geometric proof

Consider a square ABCD with side length **a**. The diagonal AC divides the square into two congruent right triangles, ABC and ADC, each with a right angle at B and D, respectively.

- **Triangle ABC**: Right-angled at B, with legs AB = BC = a, and hypotenuse AC.
- **Pythagorean theorem**: AC = √(a² + a²) = a√2.

Now, examine triangle ABC to find the angle between the diagonal AC and side AB. Let θ be the angle between AC and AB. Then:

cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = AB/AC = a/(a√2) = 1/√2.

Therefore, θ = arccos(1/√2) = **45°**.

---

## Generalization

This result is independent of the square's side length because the angle is determined by the square's inherent symmetry and the properties of right triangles. Thus, for any square, the diagonal forms a **45-degree angle** with each side.

---

## Practical implications

Understanding this angle is useful in fields such as architecture, engineering, and design, where squares and diagonals are common. For example, in construction, knowing that the diagonal of a square forms a 45-degree angle with the sides helps in laying out foundations, framing walls, and designing roofs [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The diagonal of a square forms a **45-degree angle** with each side, a property derived from the square's geometry and the Pythagorean theorem. This angle is consistent across all squares, regardless of their size.

### Effects of a physical education intervention on children's physical activity and fitness: the PROFIT pilot study [^118245d9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Agility was evaluated using the square test. A square measuring 4 m on a side was measured, with a cone arranged at each angle. The children moved as fast as possible, diagonally, then to the left (or right), going to the other diagonal and ending up towards the initial cone, always touching the cones with their hands. The children had two chances and the best moment was noted in seconds with two decimal scales.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated using the 6-minute running and walking test, the participants were divided into small groups. They were advised on the importance of running as much as possible, keeping a constant pace, and avoiding walking and running peaks. During the test, the passage of time at 3 and 5 min was reported. At the end of the test, the students remained in the place where they were, so that the distance covered during the 6 min (in meters) could be recorded (number of laps multiplied by the size of the court, added to the meters in the last return).

Flexibility was evaluated using the sit-and-reach test. The barefoot children, with their knees extended and hands overlapping, should leaned slowly, extending their hands forward as far as possible, remaining in the position as long as necessary for the distance to be noted. Two attempts were made, the best result in centimeters was recorded.

Lower limbs power was evaluated using the horizontal jump test, a measuring tape was fixed to the floor, perpendicular to the starting line. The children were instructed to remain standing with their feet parallel, behind this mark. They performed the jump as far as possible with both feet simultaneously. Each child had two attempts and the greatest distance was recorded in centimeters.

Speed was evaluated using the 20-meter run test. Children moved as quickly as possible, passing through three parallel lines previously marked: a start line, one 20 m from the first (timeline), and another 21 m from the exit (finish line). The third line served as a reference for the child not to slow down before crossing the 20 m. Time was recorded in seconds with two decimal scales.

### A self-complementary macrocycle by a dual interaction system [^df48c0a0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Hierarchical assembly of the macrocycle

Finally, we successfully constructed a further assembly based on cyclic hexamer (1) 6. When crystals of 1 were grown from CH 2 Cl 2 / n -hexane in the presence of excess trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), trigonal-shaped pale-yellow crystals were obtained. According to X-ray analysis, surprisingly, cyclic hexamer (1) 6 constructed a spherical assembly [(1) 6] 18 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 38). The spherical [(1) 6] 18 resulted in an assembly of 18 sets of (1) 6, which had a total of 108 molecules of 1 and was ca. 70 Å in diameter with a molecular weight of ca. 70 kDa (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 39a). The very large but relatively closed cavity within [(1) 6] 18 was calculated to be ~10000 Å 3 by the MoloVol program (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 39b). Since cyclic hexamer (1) 6 forms in a biconcave-lens fashion, (1) 6 can interact with four other (1) 6 molecules between the side and concave area in a cross shape through π-π interactions, leading to the formation of a square assembly (Fig. 4d). The distances between the centroids of each side are 24.5 and 25.1 Å. Nearby square assemblies share one (1) 6 as a vertex with a 90° dihedral angle; consequently, [(1) 6] 18 forms a nearly complete cuboctahedron geometry. Notably, these phenomena from 1 towards [(1) 6] 18 via (1) 6 can be considered hierarchical assembly,, which is reminiscent of the construction process of virus (e.g. HIV-1) capsids in nature,. Two molecules of TFA as an additive were found at the diagonal position of (1) 6 with hydrogen bonds and halogen-π interactionsamong hexamers, which may be induced to form a trigonal packing structure (Supplementary Fig. 40). The emission of (1) 6 was significantly quenched, probably due to charge-transfer between anthracene and electron deficient pyridyl-TFA complex. Furthermore, all assemblies [(1) 6] 18 independently existed and were separated by the rhombohedral grid [(1) 6] n, which was also formed by (1) 6 in the crystal (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figs. 41 - 42). The approximately 90 Å side of the unit grid is capable of encapsulating the [(1) 6] 18 assembly (Fig. 4f). All vertexes of cuboctahedron [(1) 6] 18 showed π-π interactions with grid sides and neighboring [(1) 6] 18 (Supplementary Fig. 43), which may contribute to stabilizing the giant assembly [(1) 6] 18.

### Artificial web of disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals [^3f004a6d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is energetically more favorable for disclination lines to run periodically along the diagonal axes with ± π /2 twists than shaping the square web, since the length of disclination line is reduced by a factorand the super-twisted states near the ± π twisted quadrants in the square web are converted to the normal twisted states with the twist angle < π /2 (for more details, see Supplementary Note 2). Nevertheless, the square web of disclinations was found to be indefinitely sustainable. Even after a vigorous shearing of the substrates to completely disrupt the disclination lines, the square web of disclinations was recovered within a fraction of a minute (Supplementary Movie 2). The remarkable stability of the web can be understood as resulting from the repulsive forces between disclination lines and the forces between the surface pattern and the disclination line. In particular, the effective repulsive force due to surface patterns, Eqs. (5) and (6), acting between the disclination lines of opposite handedness is considered vital to prevent the lines from coalescing for large angles of crossing Φ > π /2, where the direct interaction between opposite disclinations, Eq. (3), becomes increasingly attractive. In consistent with this scenario of stabilization, we observed that the web structure becomes much less stable when the pitch of the surface pattern p exceeds 100 μm. As long as the pitch p is less than ca. 50 μm, the web of disclination lines could be stably fabricated through the same procedure as described here for virtually any angle of intersection Φ, forming a wide range of rhomboidal webs (Supplementary Movie 3).

### The order of task decisions and confidence ratings has little effect on metacognition [^9fd24339]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Memory

We used a short-term memory task to probe metacognition in the memory domain (Fig. 2b). The contemporary science of metacognition was built on foundations set by meta-memory research, and short-term memory tasks are frequently contrasted with perceptual tasks to study the domain-specificity of metacognition,,. Participants viewed a rapid sequence of three abstract visual stimuli followed by a mask. They were then presented with two stimuli, a “new” foil stimulus and an “old” stimulus that appeared in the previous sequence, and had to determine which was the “old” stimulus. To calibrate performance, we manipulated the inter-stimulus interval (ISI).

Participants started each trial with a mouse click, then a navy-blue square box with sides of 6 degrees visual angle appeared at the centre of the screen for 100 ms. Next, the first stimulus appeared centred within the box for 100 ms. This was then removed, and the box remained on the screen for one ISI. This was followed by the second stimulus for 100 ms, an ISI, the third stimulus for 100 ms, and another ISI. Next, a visual mask appeared centred in the box for 800 ms. Finally, two navy-blue square boxes with sides of 6 degrees visual angle appeared to the left and right of the screen. In one box was an “old” stimulus (the target) viewed during the preceding sequence. In the other box was a “new” stimulus that was previously unseen. The stimuli remained on the screen for 2500 ms before being replaced by the response screen(s). Participants had to identify the “old” stimulus in either the left or right box, registering a left or right response.

Using techniques established in previous research, we generated a corpus of 18000 unique visual stimuli ensuring that the participant never saw the same object twice unless it appeared as a target. Each stimulus was composed of 90 lines that emerged from the centre of the image along diagonal, vertical, and horizontal directions.

Counterbalancing

Nine sessions paired each report order with each context. On day one, participants completed trials from all three contexts using one report order. On day two, trials were completed in a new arrangement of contexts for another report order. On day three, the trials were completed for each context in another arrangement using the third and final report order. This replicated latin square design yielded 72 unique arrangements of the 9 sessions, efficiently sampling from all possible combinations of report orders and contexts.

Methods

Experiment 1: Subjects

Twenty-two subjects who were recruited from the Goethe-University Frankfurt and the Fresenius University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt participated in Experiment 1. All subjects reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Two subjects aborted the experiment after the practice trials due to difficulties to perform the task. This resulted in a sample of 20 subjects (10 male), aged between 18 and 32 years (mean: 23.3 years). All subjects gave informed consent and received either a remuneration of € 10/h or course credit. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main and therefore complied with their ethical regulations.

Experiment 1: Stimuli

Random dot patterns (RDP) were presented centrally on the screen and consisted of 200 dots colored in red (RGB: [255, 0, 0]) or green (RGB: [0, 0, 255]) on a black (RGB: [0, 0, 0]) background. The dots were presented within an invisible circular aperture which had a radius of 7.5° of visual angle. The dots had a diameter of 0.15° of visual angle and were placed randomly within the circular aperture of the RDP at stimulus onset. The dots moved with a velocity of 3.5°/s and fully coherent in a direction randomly drawn from a pool of directions between 5° and 355° spaced 10° from one another, therefore avoiding cardinal directions. Dots reaching the edge of the aperture were repositioned randomly on the edge of the opposing side of the aperture, so that dot density was kept constant throughout the presentation. Throughout the whole experiment a white fixation square with a diagonal of 0.15° of visual angle was presented centrally on the screen, except for the cue presentation, when the fixation square changed its color to red or green to cue which item should be reported. The item was reported by adjusting a randomly oriented line to match the reported direction. The response line was white, with a width of 0.6° and a length equaling the dot field radius. The starting point of the line was the fixation square and the end point could be altered so that the line could point in all possible directions.

### Antiferromagnetic textures in biFeOcontrolled by strain and electric field [^46c93faf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

For BiFeO 3 thin films grown on DyScO 3, the presence of two orthogonal cycloid propagation directions (red arrows in Fig. 4a) with identical periods gives rise to two orthogonal lines of diffracted spots, thus defining a square diffracted pattern. The fine structure of this pattern is rendered more complex by additional spots that arise from the modulation of the magnetic periodicity by the ferroelectric domain structure;however, here our focus is on the cycloid propagation direction and periodicity. The spacing between the + q and − q spots corresponds to a cycloid period of 72 ± 5 nm for both spin cycloids with k 1 propagation vector. Consistently at the local scale, the combination of PFM and scanning NV magnetometry allows to identify the relative orientation of the ferroelectric polarisation (P, grey arrows in Fig. 4b) and cycloid propagation direction (k 1, red arrows in Fig. 4b) on both sides of a domain wall. Thus, our microscopic real-space experiments and macroscopic reciprocal-space observations both attest for a single cycloidal vector (k 1) in BiFeO 3 thin films under moderate compressive strain.

In contrast, for BiFeO 3 films grown on GdScO 3 imposing slight tensile strain, the dichroic diffracted pattern is no longer square but rectangular (Fig. 4c). Hence, we preclude the above-mentioned scenario with two bulk-like (cycloid I) orthogonal vectors. The two diagonals of the rectangular pattern (green arrows in Fig. 4c) form an angle of about 110 ± 5 degrees, in accordance with the typical angles observed in NV magnetometry images. The only plausible scenario, therefore, corresponds to two types of ferroelectric domains respectively harbouring alternating k 1 ′ and k 2 ′ propagation vectors of the cycloid II, as observed in real space (Fig. 4d). These two cycloid propagation variants appear to be energetically degenerated and favoured over the more out-of-plane k 3 ′ vector (Fig. 3c). Consequently, these cycloidal BiFeO 3 films, under either compressive or tensile strain, exhibit a one-to-one imprint between ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^bb5297df]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Corner coding is specific to environmental corners

To investigate the degree to which corner cells specifically encode environmental corners, we considered three properties that comprise a corner: (1) the angle of the corner, (2) the height of the walls and (3) the connection between two walls. First, we imaged as animals explored two asymmetric environments: a right triangle (30-60-90° corners) or a trapezoid (55-90-125° corners) (Fig. 2a). In these asymmetric environments, corner cells composed 3.6 ± 0.3% and 2.1 ± 0.3% of all neurons recorded in the right triangle and the trapezoid, respectively (Fig. 2b,c ; n = 8 mice). By comparison, there were essentially no neurons classified as corner cells when points on the wall were assigned as the ‘corners’ of these environments (Extended Data Fig. 1n). In the right triangle, corner cell peak spike rates were significantly higher for the 30° (2.32 ± 0.14, mean ± s.e.m.) corner compared to the 60° (1.67 ± 0.16) and 90° (1.76 ± 0.16) corners, but did not differ between the 60° and 90° corners (Fig. 2b,d). To rule out the possibility that this was due to the limited angular range of these acute angles, we compared the peak spike rates at the corners of the trapezoid and found that the peak spike rates of corner cells increased from 125° (1.49 ± 0.12, mean ± s.e.m.) to 90° (1.90 ± 0.10) to 55° (2.23 ± 0.12) (Fig. 2e). We also compared the peak spike rates at the corners using the aforementioned across-session corner cells in the triangle (60°, 1.76 ± 0.12, mean ± s.e.m. n = 9 mice), square (90°, 1.47 ± 0.11) and hexagon (120°, 1.44 ± 0.13), and found the peak spike rate was higher in the triangle compared to the square and hexagon (Fig. 2f). Together, these results suggest that corner cells encode information regarding corner angles, particularly within asymmetric environments.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^e4527d16]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Closer examinations in Fig. 5e–i reveal that each panel displays a dominant diagonal about which the panel bends more than the other diagonal. Figure 5f, g is a schematic that shows the difference between an isometrically deformed origami panel and a non-isometrically deformed origami panel, assuming that straight creases remain straight. An isometrically deformed origami panel will display a single curvature because the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere inside the panel. On the other hand, a non-isometrically deformed origami panel displays double curvature (negative Gaussian curvature) because this deformation mode stores less elastic energy. For the thinner panels as shown in Fig. 5h, by comparing the depth of bending (the black lines), we identify obvious dominant diagonals (AE and E′C) that align with the alternating asymmetric triangulation. In Fig. 5i, we also see that the dominant diagonals are AE and E′C for the thicker hypar model; however, the more in-plane deformation makes the dominant out-of-plane bending diagonals less distinguishable as in the thinner panels.

We collect positional information from the 3D images to compare with the analytical predictions in Fig. 2e. We sample coordinates of the mountain vertices to get estimates for the coefficient k. We then pick the middle points of square creases to form a zig-zag path (i.e. the green lines in Fig. 5e) to estimate the folding angles (ρ) of the corrugations.

### Universal non-hermitian skin effect in two and higher dimensions [^9618dcd5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3 
The corner-skin effect and the geometry-dependent-skin effect.

The universal skin effect can be further classified into two types by the current functional, that is, non-reciprocal skin effect (∃ α, n, J α [n] ≠ 0) and generalized reciprocal skin effect (∀ α, n, J α [n] = 0). CSE (a)–(d) and GDSE (e)-(h) are representatives of these two types of skin effects, respectively. In (a, b, e, f), the light blue regions represent the spectrum under periodic boundary, where 200*200 k -grid is used, and the red points represent the eigenvalues under different open-boundary geometries. The system size under square geometry in (c, g) is L x × L y = 60 × 60, and each triangle geometry in (d, h) has the same right-angled side length L x = L y = 60. The spatial distributions of eigenstates W (x) are plotted in (c, d, g, h) with the color bars. In the system with GDSE, the skin effect disappears under square geometry (geometry 1) in (g), and reappears under triangle geometry (geometry 2) in (h).

### On-site growth of perovskite nanocrystal arrays for integrated nanodevices [^476b87d5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sub-50 nm placement control with an asymmetric meniscus

In the square well design discussed above, the meniscus adopts a symmetric profile, so a nanocrystal is equally likely to reside in any of the four corners. However, with an asymmetric meniscus, a directional pressure gradient can be formed, allowing for precise placement of the nanocrystal at a particular location. The meniscus shape can be tuned using the contact angle between the precursor solution and well sidewalls, and the well geometry. When the contact angle is smaller than a critical angle, the meniscus changes from spanning the entire well, pinned at the sidewalls, to having some liquid remaining at the corners as it propagates into the well. An example is shown in Fig. 2b where the contact angle of DMSO to the sidewalls of a square well, whose critical angle is 45°, changes from 50° to 25°. The menisci at the corners are referred to as arc menisci, and the central region is the main terminal meniscus. Depending on the corner geometry, the critical angle for the arc meniscus formation varies. A detailed discussion is included in the Supplementary Note 1. Thus, by using an asymmetric well, an asymmetric meniscus can be obtained with different amounts of liquid trapped at each corner. This is illustrated in the triangular well of Fig. 2b.

### Machine learning enables completely automatic tuning of a quantum device faster than human experts [^53840350]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Investigating nearby voltage space

Having located the hypersurface, the algorithm then proceeds to investigate the nearby region of voltage space to determine whether a double quantum dot is formed. The investigation is carried out in the plane containing v (u) and defined by varying the two plunger gate voltages V 3 and V 7. These gates, selected before running the algorithm, are the ones that should predominantly shift the electrochemical potential in the left and right dots. If a double quantum dot is formed, the current should therefore show a honeycomb pattern in this plane, similar to Fig. 2.

First, a one-dimensional scan is made in this investigation plane, starting at v (u) and running along the diagonal axis, whereindicates a unit vector in voltage space (Fig. 4 c). This scan is chosen to have length 128 mV and resolution 1 mV. A peak detection routine identifies the presence or absence of Coulomb peaks. If Coulomb peaks are absent, investigation here ceases and a new iteration begins.

Next, if Coulomb peaks are present in this diagonal scan a two-dimensional scan is made (Fig. 4 d). The scanning region is a square oriented alongand its orthogonal axis. This square is bounded by v (u), and its side length is chosen to be 3.5 times the average peak spacing identified in the diagonal scan. (If the diagonal scan shows less than 3 peaks, the side length is set to be 100 mV.) The scan is made first at low resolution (16 × 16 pixels), and a score is assigned to the resulting current map. The score function (see Supplementary Methods, Score function) is a predefined mathematical expression designed to reward specific transport features that correspond to the visual features typically looked for by humans when manually tuning a device. In particular, it is designed to identify honeycomb patterns similar to Fig. 2 indicating the formation of a double quantum dot. It rewards current maps containing sharp and curved lines.

If the score function of the low-resolution scan is high, it is repeated at high resolution (48 × 48 pixels). The score threshold is dynamically adjusted throughout the experiment so that 15% of low-resolution scans are repeated. (See Supplementary Methods, Optimal threshold, for a statistical analysis of the optimal threshold.) The high-resolution maps, scanned in regions of voltage space identified as showing desirable double-dot behaviour, constitute the output of the tuning algorithm.

### Chemical tunnel-splitting-engineering in a dysprosium-based molecular nanomagnet [^6c9341f4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Molecular structures

We recently demonstrated the possibility of exerting a high degree of control over lanthanide CF environments by relying on a combination of HSAB (hard–soft-acid–base) preferences and the predictable square-planar geometries of group 10 metal complexes acting as ligands. Usage of [M II (SAc) 4] 2− (M = Pd, Pt; SAc − = thioacetate) metalloligands towards lanthanide ions results in fourfold symmetrical [Ln{M(SAc) 4 } 2] − complexes, which, when combined with symmetry-compatible counter cations, form crystals containing the lanthanide ion at a site of crystallographically imposed fourfold symmetry. For Ln = Dy, we reported the structures of the salts [NEt 4][Dy{Pt(SAc) 4 } 2] (1Dy, space group: P 4/ mcc), and [PPh 4][Dy{Pt(SAc) 4 } 2] (2Dy, space group: P 4/ n). The structure of the anionic dysprosium complex in crystals of the latter salt is given in Fig. 1a. Upon comparing the two compounds, the change of counter cation induces a simple yet crucial structural change. We identify two sets of four coordinating oxygen atoms, stemming from the metalloligands, each describing the vertices of a perfect square. The two squares (above and below the dysprosium ion) originate two parallel planes perpendicular to the C 4 axis. The twist angle between the diagonals of the two squares constitutes the only difference between the two complexes and is 24.11° and 44.52° for 1Dy and 2Dy, respectively (Fig. 1b,c). Through a detailed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study of the zero-field splittings of the weakly anisotropic, isometric Gd 3+ derivatives, the respective C 4 and approximate, but almost perfect D 4d point symmetries of the 1Ln and 2Ln derivatives inferred from structural metrics were verified to hold true from an electronic point of view. We emphasize that 2Dy adopts idealized D 4d symmetry to a very good approximation (a twist angle of 44.52° vs. the ideal 45°, for which a diagonal CF Hamiltonian is expected, and the eigenstates therefore would be pure | J, m J 〉 states). Due to their extremely similar chemical structures, 1Dy and 2Dy represent perfect test subjects for a study of how the tunnel splitting can be controlled via chemical engineering of the point group symmetry.

### The apical angle: a mathematical analysis of the ellipse [^72ed30ec]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The elliptical excision is a common surgical procedure. The dermatologic literature predominantly describes an excisional geometry with a 3:1 length:width ratio and an apical angle of 30 degrees.

Objective

To analyze the elliptical excision by applying mathematical principles and define the apical angle and its relationship to the length:width ratio.

Methods

We examined numerous examples of elliptical excisions as presented in the dermatologic literature. We analyzed the geometry of the excisions and defined it mathematically.

Results

The apical angle of a 3:1 elliptical excision is not 30 degrees. The true apical angle varies from 37 degrees to 74 degrees depending on excisional geometry.

Conclusion

The commonly presented apical angle of 30 degrees is incorrect and does not reflect the true apical angle of elliptical excisions.

### Surgical designs and techniques for mandibular contouring based on categorisation of square face with low gonial angle in orientals [^f2364b1c]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In East Asian population, a square face is considered unappealing as it imparts a coarse and masculine look. Therefore, Oriental women prefer to have an ovoid and slender facial contour, which is thought to be more feminine and attractive. Nowadays, mandibular contouring surgery has become a commonly performed procedure. Clinical data show that majority of patients who have severe form are characterised by a definite square-shaped face with low gonial angle. A square face is usually visualised in frontal view but the lateral view provides additional information regarding gonial angle, mandibular plane steepness, chin deficiency and more importantly, length of the ramus. These factors are the key points for a precise categorisation, design, selection of surgical methods and choosing the ostectomy line for contouring on a square face with low angle.

Patients and Methods

From 2005 to 2009, 94 women were diagnosed as square face with low angle. Three types of surgical design based on procedures such as mandibular 'V-Line' ostectomy, mandibular outer cortex split ostectomy, sliding genioplasty and inlay bone graft in various combinations were constructed, depending upon the presenting facial features.

Results

Precise categorisation, designs and techniques resulted in higher satisfaction as these procedures provided an overall narrowing and harmonising effect on the lower facial contour postoperatively.

Conclusion

Patients with square face and low gonial angle come with multitude of features so that design and technique applied should be tailored to each individual to achieve perfection.

### Strongly frustrated triangular spin lattice emerging from triplet dimer formation in honeycomb li2IrO3 [^1dbb469a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

We note that detecting the diagonal-zigzag phase by exact diagonalization calculations requires large-size setups of lattice sites. This is related to the proximity of this phase to the special point Γ =0 where the model is highly frustrated. Indeed, in this limit the classical ground-state manifold consists of a one-parameter family of states with two sublattices of spins with arbitrary relative orientation angle. This situation is common in various well-known frustrated models, such as the J 1 – J 2 model on the square lattice. The lifting of the accidental degeneracy, either by quantum fluctuations or due to a finite Γ (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), and the associated locking mechanism between the two sublattices involve a very large length scale. This explains why our exact spin–spin correlation profiles provided in Fig. 3d show that the two sublattices are nearly decoupled from each other.

Except for the Néel and the spin-liquid phase, all other phases feature rigid triplets on the B1 bonds. This is shown in Fig. 3d for the diagonal-zigzag phase at J 2 = J 3 =3, where the NN correlation function on the B1 bonds,, almost saturates to the full spin-triplet value of 1/4. This shows that the effective triplet picture is quite robust.

### Zygoma and mandibular angle reduction: contouring surgery to correct the square face in Asians [^db76df4a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Changing the facial appearance with facial contouring surgery is popular, especially in East Asian countries where a square face is a common chief complaint. Mandibular angle reduction, malar reduction, genioplasty, and chin and body contouring surgery can be performed as independent or ancillary procedures during orthognathic surgery. Many techniques have been developed and different osteotomy designs have been proposed to enhance outcomes and minimize complication risks. Here, we review the surgical techniques and considerations for mandibular angle and malar reduction, the two most commonly performed contouring surgeries in East Asia to correct the square face.

### Role of the C-terminal domain in the structure and function of tetrameric sodium channels [^6e6ed486]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Four-pulse DEER experiments enabled measurements of distance distributions between pairs of spin labels based on dipolar interactions. As the NavMs-pore+CTD is composed of four identical spin-labelled monomers in a tetrameric structure, each spin experiences more than one interaction. In the simplest case, a symmetric tetramer, the labels would form a square with distances arising from the four sides and the diagonals of the square, the latter being √2 times longer than the sides (but their signals should be half the intensity). The background-corrected dipolar evolutions (black lines) from the eight spin-labelled mutants and their derived fits (coloured lines), known as form factors (Fig. 2b, with raw data in Supplementary Fig. S2), give rise to corresponding distance distributions (coloured lines) (Fig. 2c). The labels at A221C, D250C, A260C and R268C all show a single major distance peak and a lower intensity shoulder (roughly half the amplitude of the former) at √2 times the distance. These results suggest the labels experience a highly symmetrical arrangement consistent with a rigid tetrameric structure at the base of the pore and along the central part of the proposed four-helix bundle. Labels A223C, A232C, I241C and K273C, show broader distributions with three major peaks arising from the presence of a larger range of conformations. Consistent with the cw-EPR data, this indicates a decreased symmetry and less well-defined structure in the linker region and at the C-terminus of the CTD.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^db22327a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Design of silicon micropillar arrays and operations

A schematic representation of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 1a. It consisted of a z -axis translation stage on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass plate (treated with a commercial coating agent, Glaco Mirror Coat “Zero”, Soft 99, Co.), on the top (Supplementary Method 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in the first row of each panel (Fig. 1b–d), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated well-defined shapes of silicon micropillar arrays fabricated by standard contact photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching. These microtextured surfaces can be categorized into three groups. First, cross-sectional areas of the pillars based on triangular, circular, and square were arranged in square arrays, respectively (Fig. 1b). Second, the triangular cross-sections of the pillars were arranged in triangular arrays (Fig. 1c). Third, cross-sections of the pillars based on triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular were arranged in hexagonal arrays, respectively (Fig. 1d). Note that a refers to the typical length scale of the cross-sectional area of a pillar, i.e. the side length of the triangular and square pillars, the diameter of the cylindrical pillars, and the diagonal length of the hexagonal pillars (Supplementary Fig. 2). Also, the side length of the triangular and square pillars was set to a = 20 μm, side length of the hexagonal pillars was a = 10 μm, and diameter of the cylindrical pillars was a = 20 μm. The minimum spacing of the pillars was denoted as b = 10 μm and the pillar height was h = 90 μm (Supplementary Method 2, Supplementary Table 1). All samples were first coated by a silane film CF 3 (CF 2) 9 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 (FDDTS) deposited by RPX-540 of Integrated Surface Technologies, Inc. Afterward, the surface of each pillar became hydrophobic with the Young contact angle θ 0 = 110 ± 5°. Each sample was cleaned before the experiments. By placing water (Fig. 1b–d) and liquid metal (Galinstan, Fig. 1e) droplets in a confinement consisting of a microtextured surface on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass surface on the top, polygonal-shaped droplets were formed by narrowing the separation of the two surfaces. The top-view visualization of the droplet by a CCD camera (Canon 550D, Hi-Scope advanced KH3000) and separation H of the two surfaces by length sensor (Heidenhain-Metro 2581) were recorded simultaneously. The details of the microfabrication, silanization, sample-cleaning procedure, contact angle measurements, and experimental process are all provided in the Methods section.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^a4d7097c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern,. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

### On-demand auxeticity and co-existing pre-tension induced compression stage in a sandwich design with kinematically constrained 3D suture tiles [^3c57cc05]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Under the overall tensile load, the middle layer is tensioned, the individual tiles in the tile layers shift until the tooth-channel pairs are in contact. Since after that, the soft layer is mainly under pre-tension and the tiles are under compression due to the contact induced by the layer tension, we call this deformation stage of the design PIC. The PIC is a pseudo-tensegrity stage, because that in this stage, the deformation of the design can be analogous to that in a tensegrity structure with some components under pre-tension and some under compression. It is worth noting the kinematic constraints, and therefore the auxeticity, will only be triggered after the contact in this stage. Before contact, the material will remain compliant and flexible, mainly deforming according to the properties of the softer layer. After contact, it is expected that the overall stiffness will increase in this deformation stage.

The tooth geometry is determined by the tooth base length b, tooth height h, and the incline angle γ (0° < γ < 180°) of the tooth. The incline angle is defined as the angle between the tooth midline and the tile edge (Fig. 2a). An incline angle of 90° represents when the tooth is perpendicular to the tile edge. The tooth length aspect ratio ρ is defined as ρ = h/b. Thus, when ρ approaches zero, the tooth vanishes; and when ρ approaches + ∞, the tooth-channel pair becomes a line, i.e. the suture tiles degenerate into the ideal square tiles in Fig. 1b–d.

The channel geometry matches with the tooth geometry. Also, to ensure smooth sliding, the neighboring edges of a channel and a tooth on the same tile edge are along the same straight line. As shown in Fig. 2a, the two edges of the tooth-channel pair form angles φ 1 and φ 2 with respect to the tooth edge, respectively. If γ = 90°, φ 1 = φ 2, otherwise, they are not equal. As shown in Fig. 2a, the 3D geometry of the tiles ensures one side along z direction being flat and square-shaped while the other side has a complicated 3D surface. For both tile layers, the flat side is attached to the soft middle layer, as shown in Fig. 2b, forming a sandwich structure.

### Keratoconus features on corneal higher-order aberration ablation maps: proof-of-concept of a new diagnostic modality [^1e1199e6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
(A) Contoura HOA ablation map in a representative keratoconus eye. (B) Graphical representation of the distance from center and position features of an ablation island. The distance from center (ρ) is defined as the radius (in mm) between the origin of the HOA ablation map (X = 0 and Y = 0 coordinates) and the centroid of any ablation island. The centroid denoted by the white asterisk (*) is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the X and Y coordinates of all pixels forming the ablation island (in this example, all purple pixels). The orientation (θ) of the ablation island is defined as the angle (between 0 to 360º) formed between the centroid of the ablation island and the abscissa (dotted line). (C) Graphical representation of the orientation and diameter features of an ablation island. The orientation (α) of an ablation island is defined as the angle (reported between 0 to 180º) formed between the longest diagonal of the ablation island (termed major axis in geometry) and the dotted horizontal line passing by the centroid of the ablation island. The diameter of an ablation island was defined as the length of the major axis (d). In addition to the above-defined parameters, we calculated the area (mm 2) and sphericity of each ablation island. The area was calculated by multiplying the number of pixels by the area of one pixel. The sphericity of an ablation island was defined as 4π times area divided by the square of the perimeter. Sphericity is equal to 1.0 for a perfect circle and it is smaller than 1.0 for an ellipse or a crescent shape.

Data and Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2020a. Mean and standard deviation (SD) of each feature were calculated. The coefficient of variation (CV) was computed as the SD divided by the mean and multiplied by 100. The Pearson correlation coefficient (R-value) was used to assess the relationship between continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Standard singular value decomposition-based PCA

PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving its essential information (;;). PCA is computed formultivariate observation matrix, where n is the number of individuals and m traits. If, it is practical to calculate it formatrix of. Otherwise, it is calculated formatrix of. Let us represent a scaled symmetric covariance matrixas a product of two orthonormal matricescontaining orthogonal unit vectors as columns and one diagonal matrixsuch as. Orthogonality ofmeans that.is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values ofon the diagonal. Now, if we multiply both sides from left and right withand, respectively, we obtain, where the right hand side of equation contains eigenvalues of matrixin the diagonal in the ascending order. This decomposition is related to singular value decomposition (SVD). For PCA, the singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, and both eigenvalues and singular values provide insights into the phenotypic variability and importance of different components (eigenvectors or basis vectors) in transforming and summarizing the observed phenotypic profiles.

### Overcurvature describes the buckling and folding of rings from curved origami to foldable tents [^3f942d9a]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Creased paper rings are a third example of overcurved structures (Fig. 2c). In curved origami, paper is creased along closed curved paths, resulting in the out-of-plane bending of the folding path due to torsion. Simultaneously, the conservation of arc length by the two sides of the crease imposes an increase of the curvature of the crease by a factor O p =1/cos(δ /2), where δ is the angle between the normals to the two sides of the crease (Supplementary Methods ; Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 ; Supplementary equation S19). We creased a flat circular ring of paper along its median circle, and adjusted the degree of overcurvature by tuning the crease angle δ and holding it constant. After observations, the paper ring was cut and the number of turns in the formed coil was quantified to compute O p. This overcurvation process corresponds to increasing the local pre-set curvature while keeping the length constant.

Finally, to give a human-scale example of overcurved structures, arcs of wood of radius of curvature R =1 m were combined with clamping collars to form closed continuous rings of square cross-section, with different magnitudes of the pre-set overcurvature. Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d and in Supplementary Fig. S4.

The overcurvation scenario is similar for all observed systems: the conformation starts from a circle at O p =1 and buckles to a saddle shape with two pairs of upper and lower lobes for larger pre-set overcurvatures. The opposite lobes of the saddle then overlap close to O p =2.5, and the ring finally debuckles to form a triple-coiled loop for O p =3. All conformations have D 2d symmetry (for creased paper, this holds true only for the crease line). Although some issues are specific to each case, such as the cross-section rotation angle or the formation of wrinkles and lateral creases, the general scenario is identical for these systems, which cover almost five orders of magnitude in spatial scale, and for which the physical origin of overcurving differs sensibly. In the sequel, we concentrate on the general conformation of the centre lines of the rings (or of the crease lines for paper strips), and ignore details such as small wrinkles and lateral creases.

The red squares in e represent the ZnTHPP moieties. f A diagrammatic drawing of a THPG vesicle. g The magnified membrane cross-section. h The packing model of THPGs in the vesicle membrane.

The above-mentioned results indicate that porphyrin units spontaneously supra-polymerize into nanofilaments with a thickness around 9.5 Å through directional π–π stacking. However, this thickness is a little bit smaller than the width of the ZnTHPP molecules (1.08 nm in length of side and 1.56 nm in diagonal length from a 3D molecular structure in Supplementary Fig. 10a). Thus, it is not possible for ZnTHPP molecules to pack in the form of H aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 10b). On the contrary, there should be some inclined arrangement with a tilt angle among ZnTHPP units in the nanofilaments as shown Supplementary Fig. 10c, supporting the J-aggregation process. As further evidence, the synchrotron SAXS measurement (Fig. 3d) shows two sharp peaks at q = 1.72 and 1.56 Å −1 in the spectrum, which can be attributed to the π–π stacking between adjacent porphyrin units with corresponding distances of 3.6 and 4.0 Å according to Bragg equation, respectively. The distance of 3.6 Å is generally assigned to a typical face to face paralleled arrangement among porphyrins, while the distance 4.0 Å should originate from the non-paralleled porphyrin pairs with a certain angle of tilt. Moreover, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of THPG vesicles in solid state shows weak chiral signal (Supplementary Fig. 11), which also suggests the porphyrins should be supra-polymerized into nanofilaments in the vesicles with a slight spiral twist structure.

### A tissue bandage for pelvic ganglia injury [^84b0e105]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

TB simulates mini-tissue and can potentially promote angiogenesis

The scaffold comprises a bilayer structure, with the bottom layer designed as a square grid featuring diagonal lines extending in both directions, creating a “✳” shape node between fibers. The top layer consists of strength fibers arranged in a single direction (Fig. 2a). The basal mini fibers have an average diameter of 27.90 ± 2.49 μm, with the 45° gap measuring 186.66 ± 8.60 μm and the 90° gap measuring 279.06 ± 11.08 μm. The strength fibers have 167.99 ± 7.39 μm diameter and a gap of 814.45 ± 41.89 μm (Fig. 2b). It provides the ability for the bandage to roll on one axis, similar to bandages used in clinical settings that can easily wrap around the ganglia (Fig. 2c). However, the pore size is uneven within one square, due to the limitation of printing accuracy and the addition of strength fibers (Fig. 2b). The frequency of pore size has distinct peaks at 2-3k and 7-8k (Fig. 2d). The cumulative frequency of pore size could be effectively fitted by the Sigmoidal-Boltzmann model (adjusted R 2 exceeding 99.77%), leading to the derivation of formula (1):where A 1 is the initial value, A 2 is the final value, x 0 is the center, and dx is the time constant. Specifically, A 1 = −12.78, A 2 = 100.41, x 0 = 7.42, dx = 3.12.

### Robot-assisted inferior mediastinal angioleiomyoma resection with diagonal approach [^b237d2a8]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In robot-assisted thoracic surgery with the patient in the lateral decubitus position, the da Vinci patient cart is typically docked at the head side, with the camera angled toward the lung's apex. However, when operating in lower areas, achieving a clear view and maintaining forceps mobility can be challenging, necessitating a different approach. Cerfolio and colleaguesreported that side-docking, where the patient cart is rolled in from the back, is beneficial for mediastinal tumors located below the inferior pulmonary vein.

In this case, the patient cart was docked diagonally at a 30° angle from the ventral side of the leg. This approach allowed for comfortable manipulation of the forceps without interference with the spine or other organs. Additionally, the diagonal approach enabled the assistant to participate in the surgery without stress because there was no obstruction from the cart or the patient's arms.

The pathological diagnosis in this case was angioleiomyoma. Angioleiomyoma is a benign tumor characterized by the proliferation of mature perivascular smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels.Its occurrence in the mediastinum is extremely rare; to date, only 6 cases have been reported.This was the first instance of such a tumor being resected using robot-assisted surgery. In this case, the blood vessels supplying the tumor originated from the aorta and intercostal arteries and veins necessitating meticulous vascular dissection to prevent significant bleeding. By employing diagonal docking, precise manipulation of the forceps was possible, allowing for the safe resection of the tumor. Additionally, there was a high risk of postoperative lymph leakage due to the presence of numerous lymph vessels, but this was successfully prevented by accurate clipping.

### Biomechanics of the rhombic transposition flap [^3fd68e09]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a computational model of cutaneous wound closures comparing variations of the rhombic transposition flap.

Study Design

A nonlinear hyperelastic finite element model of human skin was developed and used to assess flap biomechanics in simulated rhombic flap wound closures as flap geometric parameters were varied.

Setting

In silico.

Methods

The simulation incorporated variables of transposition angle, flap width, and tissue undermining. A 2-dimensional second-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was fit to published experimental skin data. Resultant stress and strain fields as well as local surface changes were evaluated.

Results

For the rhombus defect, closure stress and strain were minimized for the transposition flap with a distal flap angle of 30° by recruiting skin from opposing sides of the defect. Alteration of defect dimensions showed that peak stress and principal strain were minimized with a square defect. Likelihood of a standing cutaneous deformity was driven by the magnitude of angle closure at the flap base. Manipulation of the transposition angle reoriented the primary skin strain vector. Asymmetric undermining decoupled wound closure tension from strain, with direct effects on boundary deformation.

Conclusions

The model demonstrates that flap width determines the degree of secondary tissue movement and impact on surrounding tissues. Transposition angle determines the orientation of maximal strain. Local flap design requires consideration of multiple factors apart from idealized biomechanics, including adjacent "immobile" structures, scar location, local skin thickness, and orientation of relaxed skin tension lines. Finite element models can be used to analyze local flap closures to optimize outcomes.

### Diagonal nematicity in the pseudogap phase of HgBaCuO [^ac6140b6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The pseudogap phenomenon in the cuprates is arguably the most mysterious puzzle in the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The tetragonal cuprate HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ , with only one CuO 2 layer per primitive cell, is an ideal system to tackle this puzzle. Here, we measure the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy within the CuO 2 plane with exceptionally high-precision magnetic torque experiments. Our key finding is that a distinct two-fold in-plane anisotropy sets in below the pseudogap temperature T * , which provides thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken four-fold symmetry. Surprisingly, the nematic director orients along the diagonal direction of the CuO 2 square lattice, in sharp contrast to the bond nematicity along the Cu-O-Cu direction. Another remarkable feature is that the enhancement of the diagonal nematicity with decreasing temperature is suppressed around the temperature at which short-range charge-density-wave formation occurs. Our result suggests a competing relationship between diagonal nematic and charge-density-wave order in HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ .

### On-site growth of perovskite nanocrystal arrays for integrated nanodevices [^c4125246]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To investigate the effect of meniscus asymmetry on the nanocrystal positioning, we fabricated wells of different geometries as shown in Fig. 2a. These include a square, an equilateral triangle, and two isosceles triangles with corner angles (44°, 68°, 68°) and (20°, 80°, 80°). The critical contact angles associated with these well designs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. To allow direct comparison between the different geometries, the wells are made to support an equal volume of the precursor solution. For this, the well dimensions are selected to yield a constant area corresponding to that of a 150 nm × 150 nm square, while maintaining a constant height of 22 nm for all samples. The wells are further made to have a contact angle of 50° to the precursor solution, through a second functionalization step. This contact angle is controlled by varying the duration of the fluorination step, an example of which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. Nanocrystals, 38 ± 3 nm in lateral dimension, are obtained for all the well geometries, which is as expected given the wells’ constant volume (Fig. 2c). Depending on the geometry, instances of multiple nanocrystals per well are also observed. Notably, an asymmetric well geometry favors the formation of single crystals with the yield improving to 80% for the (20°, 80°, 80°) template (Fig. 2d).

### Flexible hippocampal representation of abstract boundaries supports memory-guided choice [^757b0f76]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Drag-and-rate

We quantified participants’ reconstruction performance in the post-scan drag-and-rate task. We computed the area of the screen occupied by the square and the distorted shape using the shoelace formula. Subsequently, we evaluated the empirical probability of 16 uniformly distributed points falling within these areas, which yielded a p < 0.001. To rule out a bias in clustering the goods’ placement around the center of the screen, we calculated the distance of every cued good from each of the four replaced boundaries and the center of the screen. We then selected the minimum distance from the boundary of each cued good. This resulted in two distance vectors for each participant, one reflecting distances from the boundary and one reflecting distances from the center of the space. We compared the two distance vectors with a paired t -test, measuring the magnitude of the difference between those distances for each participant. We tested the t-statistic from the paired t -tests against zero to calculate group level statistics. To investigate the different cued good placement from the boundaries and centroid of the reconstructed figure, we computed the centroid of the polygon resulting from individual boundary placement and then followed the same procedure.

Asking whether participants’ placement precision was related to individual differences in choice accuracy, we investigated participants’ ability to equally rescale the price and freshness ranges during the drag-and-rate task. Consequently, we computed the length of reconstructed diagonals by calculating the Euclidean distance between boundaries of each axis, which resulted in a “Price" and a “Freshness" diagonal. We ran a paired t -test to check for differences in the length of the two diagonals. Testing for individual differences in diagonal rescaling to equal dimensions, we correlated the difference in the length of diagonals for each participant with their fMRI task accuracy. We next investigated how participants’ placement precision of the landmark good. Since the landmark was originally close to the center of both square and distorted shapes, we asked how closely participants’ placed the landmark to the center of their reconstructed shape. Consequently, we computed the Euclidean distance between the centroid of each participants’ reconstruction and their replaced landmark, which was then correlated with their fMRI task performance.

### Non-coplanar helimagnetism in the layered van-der-waals metal DyTe [^a70a4420]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Van-der-Waals magnetic materials can be exfoliated to realize ultrathin sheets or interfaces with highly controllable optical or spintronics responses. In majority, these are collinear ferro-, ferri-, or antiferromagnets, with a particular scarcity of lattice-incommensurate helimagnets of defined left- or right-handed rotation sense, or helicity. Here, we report polarized neutron scattering experiments on DyTe 3 , whose layered structure has highly metallic tellurium layers separated by double-slabs of dysprosium square nets. We reveal cycloidal (conical) magnetic textures, with coupled commensurate and incommensurate order parameters, and probe the evolution of this ground state in a magnetic field. The observations are well explained by a one-dimensional spin model, with an off-diagonal on-site term that is spatially modulated by DyTe 3 's unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order. The CDW-driven term couples to antiferromagnetism, or to the net magnetization in an applied magnetic field, and creates a complex magnetic phase diagram indicative of competing interactions in this easily cleavable van-der-Waals helimagnet.

### Yoked surface codes [^9e0c45c6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Yoked surface code patches change the length and number of shortest error paths. In 1D yoked surface codes, shortest error paths correspond to two shortest error paths in different surface code patches. This doubles the code distance, but introduces quadratic scaling in r, the number of rounds between yoke checks. Furthermore, since a logical failure can occur over any two patches in the code, the number of shortest error paths also scales quadratically in n. Based on this, we expect the scaling of the 1D yoked logical error rate to be, where λ 1 denotes the increased error suppression factor obtained from doubling the code distance, which we would expect to be at most. Note that the quadratic scaling versus r is only for numbers of rounds up to the yoke check period. Shortest paths from patches in different check periods don’t combine to form a shortest error path in the concatenated code (although they can form an effective measurement error). Consequently, we expect the scaling versus rounds to be quadratic up to the check period, and then linear afterwards.

A similar argument holds for 2D yoked surface codes, for which the distance quadruples, but now the error scaling becomes quartic versus the number of rounds r between yoke checks, while remaining quadratic in the number of patches n. The quartic scaling versus r is similar: within the support of a weight four logical error, any combination of error paths within those patches can cause the error. The quadratic scaling versus n is because weight four logical errors correspond to four logical errors landing on the corners of a rectangle within the grid. There are Θ (n 2) of these rectangles specified by their endpoints across a diagonal. Based on this, we expect the scaling of the 2D yoked logical error rate to be, where λ 2 denotes the increased error suppression factor obtained from quadrupling the code distance, which we would expect to be at most.

We emphasize that these are simple path-counting heuristics, where we can empirically fit the different λ factors and coefficients. However, these can of course break down. For example in 2D, the set of higher-weight inner logical errors leading to failure could scale as o (r 4). Despite this, we observe good agreement between simulation and these heuristic scaling laws.

### Terahertz rectification in ring-shaped quantum barriers [^a4e5ef19]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 2b describes the polarization-dependent behaviors of the instantaneous total tunneling current of a triangular loop under a THz field illumination. Electric potential along the contour shows an asymmetric distribution as a consequence of the lack of inversion symmetry inherent in the triangle geometry. It is interesting to note that the contour integration of the barrier potential affected by the external surface current sources always vanishes independent of the loop shape and loop orientation, automatically eliminating the Ohmic component (see Supplementary Note 1). However, the non-vanishing total current through the barrier naturally emerges for the triangle shape because of the nonlinearity in tunneling current vs. applied potential relation (see Eq. 3 in Methods) together with the triangle’s lack of inversion symmetry. Figure 2c shows the measured current responses from triangular and square loops as a function of the THz polarizer angle. The results show strikingly different behaviors depending on the loop geometry. A much higher current flows across the triangular barrier than the square one since the asymmetric potential distribution along the equilateral triangle results in a net tunneling current through the contour while the potential distribution at any point of a square is mostly counterbalanced by its corresponding point across the center, independent of the polarization of the incident pulse. Figure 2d displays polar plots of the tunneling currents for the triangular and square geometries, where the current amplitudes are reconstructed by assuming that the incident field maintains its amplitude for different polarization angles (see Methods for details). The total current vs. polarization angle shows the three-fold rotational symmetry of an equilateral triangle.

### Surgical anatomy of the anterior ethmoidal canal in ethmoid roof [^c8395f90]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study was undertaken to examine three main relationships. First, the distance and angle from the anterior ethmoidal canal to the limen nasi and the sill were measured. Second, the location of the anterior ethmoidal canal was examined in relation to the lamellas and the skull base. Third, the existence of bony defects in the canal and the course of the canal through the anterior cranial fossa were studied.

Study Design

This study employed both sagittal computed tomography and cadaver dissection.

Methods

Seventy sagittally divided heads from randomly chosen Korean adult cadavers were used. Sagittal computed tomography was performed on all specimens. Then they were meticulously dissected under a surgical microscope.

Results

The mean distance and angle between the limen nasi and the anterior ethmoidal canal were 49.0 mm and 54.5 degrees, respectively. The anterior ethmoidal canal was located between the second and third lamella in 61 of 70 cases. In 60 of 70 cases it was attached to the base of the skull, and in the remaining 10 cases it ran 2 to 3 mm below the skull base. When viewed from the superior side, the course of the anterior ethmoidal canal formed a diagonal line from the lateral to the medial side. Partial bony defects of the anterior ethmoidal canal were observed in eight cases, and complete bony defects in none.

Conclusion

This study provides surgeons with a better understanding of the anatomy of the anterior ethmoidal canal.

### Pre-placement sharp angle traction-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for the treatment of laterally spreading tumors of the colon [^63688ce5]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is challenging in the colon due to limited submucosal space, as well as factors such as colonic folds and respiratory movements. Thus, traction-assisted endoscopy has gained attention; yet, the best traction technique remains under debate. The previously reported double-clip counter-traction method, while effective, faces limitations as the counter-traction effect diminishes and the submucosal space narrows during the procedure. In this study, we refined the double-clip counter-traction technique and introduced a preplacement sharp angle traction method (Video 1).

We encountered a 2-cm adenomatous polyp in the sigmoid colon, which exhibited lateral growth and a central depression. The procedure began with a submucosal injection, followed by a circumferential mucosal incision. Prior to applying traction, clip and a rubber band were strategically placed on the opposite side of the lesion to facilitate diagonally proximal traction (Fig. 1 a). An additional clip was utilized to secure the rubber band to the anal side of the lesion, creating a sharp angle of traction that elevated the submucosal tissue into a tent-like formation (Fig. 1 b). As dissection progressed, the traction effect gradually improved (Fig. 1 c). This method demonstrated successful application in the whole colon region.

Fig. 1 
Schematic description of the strategy. a The clip with a rubber band anchored at an appropriate distance and orientation on the diagonally opposite of the lesion; b an additional clip was employed to secure the rubber band to the anal side of the lesion creating a sharp angle of traction; c good exposure of the submucosa tissue, which is easy to obtain satisfactory traction; and d integration with a transparent cap, and the traction effect progressively improves as the submucosal layer of the lesion is dissected.

Previous studies have indicated that positioning clips and rubber bands on the anal side of the lesion often fails to achieve an optimal traction angle. In contrast, the preplacement sharp angle traction method aligns better with the clinicianʼs expectations of the traction direction, allowing for easy adjustments in the event of positioning deviations. This tent-like traction technique not only enhances exposure of the submucosal tissue but also reduces the risk of muscular injury. Furthermore, this method integrates seamlessly with a transparent cap (Fig. 1 d), improving traction as the submucosal layer is dissected and facilitating rapid and complete resection of the lesion. Finally, pathological results confirmed R0 resection.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,and. Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Generation of spatiotemporal acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented orbital angular momentum [^37273a33]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Direct rotation of spatiotemporal (ST) vortices in three-dimensional (3D) space

While previous studies on acoustic OAM have primarily focused on longitudinal and transverse OAM, it is essential to recognize that acoustic OAM can exhibit arbitrary orientations. To alter the direction of the OAM, we can directly rotate the wave packet carrying transverse or longitudinal OAM in 3D space. Here, we take the example of rotating a wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM. Considering a 45-degree rotation around the-axis of the acoustic pressure field described in Eq. (1) and setting, the rotated wave packet is expressed as:

The wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM is rotated without altering its propagation direction along the-axis. The intrinsic OAM carried by the tilted wave packet can be calculated using Eqs. (3)–(5) as, indicating that the OAM direction also rotates 45 degrees around the-axis. The 3D iso-intensity profiles, derived from both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for the rotated wave packet, are illustrated in Fig. 3 a, b, including perspective, front, side, and top views. The direction of the OAM after rotation is indicated by orange arrows in Fig. 3a. From the three views, it is evident that there is a tunnel tilted at a 45-degree angle upwards relative to the-axis. This is because the singularity line is rotated from being aligned with the z-axis to a direction at a 45-degree angle to the z-axis. Figure 3 c, d presents the amplitude distributions in the,, andcross-sections passing through the center of the wave packet, and Fig. 3 e, f illustrate the corresponding phase distributions, based on both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Due to the rotation of the wave packet, the previously circular intensity distribution on theplane is now rotated onto a plane with a normal vector of. The tilted annular intensity distribution obtained after rotation exhibits an elliptical intensity distribution on both theandcross-sections, while the diagonal line with zero intensity in thecross-section corresponds to the tilted tunnel passing through the center of the wave packet, as illustrated in Fig. 3 c, d. The phase distribution in thecross-section exhibits an edge phase dislocation, corresponding to the transverse OAM component in the-direction, while the phase distribution in thecross-section manifests a helical phase dislocation, corresponding to the longitudinal OAM component in the-direction, as shown in Fig. 3 e, f. Here, only an example of a wave packet rotating 45 degrees around the-axis is shown. More generally, by controlling the direction and angle of rotation of the wave packet, the orientation of OAM can be precisely manipulated in the 3D space.

### Contact angle measurement of free-standing square-millimeter single-layer graphene [^592ff6b2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Square millimeters of free-standing graphene do not exist per se because of thermal fluctuations in two-dimensional crystals and their tendency to collapse during the detachment from the substrate. Here we form millimeter-scale freely suspended graphene by injecting an air bubble underneath a graphene monolayer floating at the water–air interface, which allowed us to measure the contact angle on fully free-standing non-contaminated graphene. A captive bubble measurement shows that free-standing clean graphene is hydrophilic with a contact angle of 42° ± 3°. The proposed design provides a simple tool to probe and explore the wettability of two-dimensional materials in free-standing geometries and will expand our perception of two-dimensional materials technologies from microscopic to now millimeter scales.

### Standards for quantitative assessments by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA): an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) [^c62a38c1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2024). High credibility.

CCTA assessment of intervened coronary artery segments—treated segment boundaries, stenosis calculation, and illustrative examples specify that the treated coronary segment includes 5 mm proximal and distal to the boundaries of the stent, bioresorbable scaffold or balloon, and in stented segments the treated segment is between dashed lines which are 5 mm away from the edges. Area stenosis is calculated as the percentage lumen reduction at the narrowest section (minimum lumen area relative to the averaged reference areas) measured outside the treated segment (>5 mm beyond the edges). Imaging limitations include that blooming and beam hardening prevent accurate evaluation of the lumen within metal stents. Examples include a chronic total occlusion with occluded segment of 37.8mm measured along the curved reconstruction and a bifurcation disease annotated as Medina classification 1, 1, 0 with measurement of the angles between the left anterior descending coronary artery and a diagonal branch.

The final column shows the total current direction (inward or outward from the loop). The direction of the surface current determines the potential distribution, which in turn drives the tunneling currents across each side of the triangle.

To directly compare the currents from the two loops of different sizes, a factor of 2.1 (=210 μm/100 μm) is multiplied to the current measured from the square loop. d Polar plot of the reconstructed current (red and blue filled curves) obtained from the results in (c).

### Edge-oriented and steerable hyperbolic polaritons in anisotropic van der waals nanocavities [^8532ce4f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Edge-tailored hyperbolic PhPs in anisotropic vdW square nanocavities

We next proceed to study a more complex geometry, i.e. a rectangle. A series of square shape nanocavities were fabricated with varying rotation angles with respect to the [001] direction (SEM image in Supplementary Fig. 1c). We see that anisotropic polaritons are regulated by the boundary edges and form angle-dependent patterns (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, the PhP fringes of a pair of square nanocavities with rotation angles θ 1 and θ 2 appear to be strictly mirror-symmetrical, when θ 1 + θ 2 = 90°, for example, θ 1 = 15 or 30° (square Sq2 or Sq3, Fig. 2a) and θ 2 = 75 or 60° (square Sq6 or Sq5, Fig. 2a). Specifically, for θ = 45° (square Sq2, Fig. 2a), hyperbolic PhPs are equally generated at left and right edges and interference at the top and bottom vertices, similar to those in the corner of graphene and hBN described in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 6, as every edge contributes to the polariton distribution in the nanocavity. Due to the interference of the hyperbolic wavefronts from the two horizontal corners of the square, an eye shape pattern at the center of the square α-MoO 3 nanocavity can be observed. These features strongly underpin the opportunity offered by in-plane anisotropic nanocavities based on α-MoO 3. To further corroborate the observation of angle-dependent PhPs, we performed nanoscale Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (nano-FTIR, “Methods”) measurements perpendicular to the edges with varied angles (as the k e direction, white dotted lines in Fig. 2a), as shown in Fig. 2b–e. As evidence of the edge effect, a series of angle-dependent signal maxima (color dashed lines, Fig. 2b–e), corresponding to phonon frequencies of α-MoO 3, are observed within the band limits. We find that the signal maxima show different spacings (corresponding to λ p) and that λ p decreases not only with a frequency increase, but also with increasing angle θ. The experimental and numerical dispersion relations of PhPs in α-MoO 3 with θ = 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45° are compared, showing good consistency (Fig. 2f, see more details “Methods”). Overall, these nano-FTIR results and dispersion relations confirm that the rotating square α-MoO 3 nanocavities support edge-tailored PhPs with in-plane anisotropic propagation, thus adding another strategy to the library of nano-light manipulation in vdW materials.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^5747a454]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4 
Folded configurations of three triangulated hypar origami with different panel widths display invariant hypar geometry (same patterns as in Fig. 1). The three origami patterns have the same number of square creases (counted from the center outwards), denoted by n. Every other square crease is a mountain, and thus there are 10 mountain creases in total. Two panels on the both sides of a mountain crease are assigned the same width. All three concentrically pleated origami can fold approximately into the same hypar shape, as indicated by the red quadratic curves. a Standard hypar pattern: panel width d is a constant for all corrugations. b Functionally graded hypar pattern: panel width d increases as n increases. c Random hypar pattern: panel width d is a random variable for each corrugation. Since the hypar patterns are triangulated, folding is achieved by rigid origami simulation. The left images show the 3D views of the folded hypar origami. The middle images show the side views. The right images present quantitative measures. The blue dots (each dot corresponds to a mountain) in the charts show how (d / L) vanishes as n increases. The green dots show the residual (or error) of Eq. (2) when n is finite

Connecting geometry with mechanics

With an analytical description of the global homogenized geometry of the hypar pattern, we can associate the mechanical behavior of the pattern with its geometry by expressing the system energy in terms of the folding kinematics. First, let us consider how a hypar origami folds into a stable saddle shape. We start from a flat hypar pattern, and forcefully fold up the pattern. After the origami is folded into shape, the folding creases undergo inelastic deformation, which shifts the neutral (i.e. stress free) angles of the folding hinges from zero to the angles at a folded state with shape coefficient k = k 0 (see Eq. 10). However, the panels undergo elastic deformation, as we observe that they return to the initial flat configuration once cut out from a folded hypar origami. Thus, we assume that the bending hinges still have their neutral angles equal to zero, which corresponds to the state at k = 0. A stable configuration is drawn by minimizing the system total energy (E T).

### Uniform two-dimensional square assemblies from conjugated block copolymers driven by π-π interactions with controllable sizes [^c132254b]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To reveal the details of the molecular arrangements, appropriate characterization techniques for 2-D square micelles were necessary. First, we hoped to have the aid of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). However, the SAED pattern indicated the formed 2-D square micelles were almost non-crystalline (Supplementary Fig. 22a). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) photographs also confirmed the non-crystalline morphology of the 2-D square micelles, as there was no clear crystal lattice observed on the surface of the square micelle (Supplementary Fig. 22b).

Then, 2-D square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 22 and PPV 12 - b -P2VP 36 were characterized by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the molecular packing in the assembly structures (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 25a). The 2-D square micelles of the two BCPs exhibited similar 2-D GIWAXS patterns. From the profiles along the in-plane direction (Fig. 6e), the reflections (100) and (200) were clearly visible, and no periodic reflection peaks along q z were observed. This suggested that PPV 12 - b -P2VP 22 and PPV 12 - b -P2VP 36 molecules favor an edge-on configuration in the 2-D platelet square micelles, which is consistent with previously discussed data. The d spacing of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 22 molecules arranged in the 2-D square micelles was calculated as 9.46 Å. The reflection peak, q = 1.505 Å −1, could be attributed to the (010) reflection, and the d spacing of 3.70 Å, calculated from peak q = 1.699 Å −1, originates from the π–π stacking of the PPV 12 backbones parallel to the substrate. The angle of the adjacent molecular chain was 135° (Supplementary Fig. 26). A similar result could also be obtained from GIWAXS measurement of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 36. According to the previous literatures,, the PPV molecules without side chains should adopt a herringbone molecular arrangement, where molecules are packed in layer-by-layer mode and within one layer the adjacent molecules are parallel to each other. This herringbone molecular arrangement agreed with the data measured by our GIWAXS experiments, indicating that the molecules of PPV 12 - b -P2VP n in the 2-D platelet square micelles should pack through π–π interactions and probably adopt a herringbone configuration. This molecular arrangement was also supported by molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 6f). From the simulation results, the PPV 12 blocks and the P2VP blocks aggregated together respectively because of the hydrophilic–hydrophobic interactions. The PPV 12 blocks interlaced with each other, and the adjacent π-conjugated PPV 12 blocks arranged to form a V shape with the side alkyl chains inserted between them. In the diagonal direction, the molecules had the same advantage of growing orientation, which possibly caused the formation of the square shapes of the 2-D micelles.

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^b06e7ef0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2, …) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

### Denominator of cranial vault asymmetry index: choosing between longer and shorter diagonal lengths [^b4ad5f79]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Since it was proposed in this journal in 2001, the cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) has been an important parameter for assessing cranial shape. However, different publications currently use different variables in the denominator of the CVAI formula. We thus investigated the use of long and short diagonal lengths as variables in the denominator of the CVAI formula. We searched the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for articles published between 2016 and 2022 that cited the original work article of CVAI. Articles were included if they were written in English and if the denominator of the CVAI formula was specified. For multiple articles by the same author, only the most recent article was included. In total, 30 articles were included; 10 articles used the longer diagonal length as the denominator and 20 articles used the shorter diagonal length. No uniform trend was observed by a country or journal of publication. Application of the CVAI formula using different denominators yielded interchangeable results, and the resulting values had only negligible differences clinically. However, it would be necessary to create a standard formula for using the CVAI as a parameter for reporting cranial shape assessments consistently.

### Tristable nematic liquid-crystal device using micropatterned surface alignment [^970ea2f6]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

It has long been appreciated that liquid-crystal (LC) devices in which the LC molecules adopt multiple stable orientations could drastically reduce the power consumption required for high-information-content displays. But for the commonly used nematic LCs, which are intrinsically uniaxial in symmetry, no industrially feasible multi-stable LC device has been realized. Recently we demonstrated how bistability can be robustly engineered into a nematic LC device, by patterning a substrate with an orientational chequerboard pattern that enforces orthogonal LC alignment in neighbouring square domains. As a result of the four-fold symmetry of the pattern, the two diagonal axes of the chequerboard become equally stable macroscopic orientations. Here we extend this symmetry approach to obtain a tristable surface-aligned nematic LC. A microscopic pattern exhibiting six-fold symmetry is inscribed on a polyimide surface using the stylus of an atomic force microscope. The hexagonal symmetry of the microscopic orientational domains in turn gives rise to three stable macroscopic LC orientations, which are mutually switchable by an in-plane electric field. The resulting switching mode is surface driven, and hence should be compatible with demanding flexible display applications.

### A data-driven approach to optimising the encoding for multi-shell diffusion MRI with application to neonatal imaging [^e5ce92c6]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Identifying a suitable linear basis

In contrast to the angular domain, where spherical harmonics form a natural basis,there is no such natural basis to represent the b -value dependence of the signal. While some bases have been proposed, – there is an inherent scale dependence that makes the analysis dependent on user-defined parameters (D).For this reason, we adopted a fully data-driven, model-free basis, derived using matrix decomposition approaches.

We use the compact singular value decomposition (SVD), which decomposes a general m × n matrix A (with m ≤ n) as USV T, where U is a m × m orthonormal matrix, S is a m × m diagonal matrix of singular values, and V T is a m × n orthonormal matrix. To make use of this decomposition, we form the compact SVD of the transpose of D :

More specifically, we consider a multi-shell protocol consisting of N s b -values, with n s uniformly distributed DW directions for the shell index s. We form the N s × N v matrix D consisting of the mean DW signal for each brain voxel at each b -value, where N v is the number of voxels in the subject-specific brain mask. We wish to decompose D into a N s × N v matrix W of per-voxel weights, and a N s × N s orthonormal basis matrix H, such that:

The weight and basis matrices can then be obtained as:

Furthermore, thanks to the properties of the SVD, the singular values (i.e. the diagonal of S) can be used to obtain an estimate of the typical component-wise effect sizes ϵ (this evaluates to the root-mean-square value of the weights across the rows of W):

Global twist deformation in a square-lattice

The object termed Twisttower (Fig. 1c) is a complex of four cuboid-like domains fused together. The cuboids feature 2 × 2, 4 × 4, 6 × 6, and 8 × 8 helices, respectively, in a quadratic cross-sectional arrangement (Fig. 2a). The Twisttower design allowed us to systematically study twist deformations, and how they may be removed, in a square-lattice packing context as a function of cross-sectional area. In the cryo-EM map that we determined, each cuboid domain exhibited an independent right-handed twist deformation around the helical axis of the domain (Fig. 2a). Such twist deformations are expected to arise a priori for square-lattice designs with default eight-base-pair crossover spacing because the design specifics create right-handed internal torques. These torques are produced by helical underwinding from 10.5 to 10.67 base pairs per turn imposed by the square-lattice connectivity. The global twist observed in each Twisttower domain decreased with the increasing cross-sectional area (Fig. 2a, left). To remove the global twist deformation, the internal design specifics must be changed such that the right-handed internal torques are mechanically balanced by counteracting left-handed torques. This may be achieved by locally deviating from the default eight-base-pair crossover spacing design rules following previously discussed concepts, by reducing the average bases between crossovers to achieve the native 10.5 base pairs per turn. We thus designed and solved a cryo-EM structure of a refined variant of the Twisttower in which we eliminated the global twist deformations. As a result, we obtained a more orderly object with a more regular square-lattice structure (Fig. 2a, right).

As in experimental measures, the receptive fields change with cortical distance in position (retinotopy), ONOFF dominance, orientation preference, and subregion structure (top). The orientation preference and orientation selectivity also changes systematically with cortical distance (bottom). e Model-data comparison of ON-OFF retinotopy changes with cortical distance (see movie Fig. 6e).

### The position of the inferior alveolar nerve at the mandibular angle:: an anatomic consideration for aesthetic mandibular angle reduction [^f1abdd19]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Mandibular angle reduction is a popular contouring surgery in Asia. Avoidance of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve is crucial during these procedures. Anatomic data regarding the position of the nerve in the mandibular angle area are sparse. The purpose of this study was to use 3-dimensional computed tomographic data to evaluate the nerve in patients with prominent mandibular angles and to compare the nerve position with a normative group. A total of 28 female and 5 male adult patients who presented with a complaint of prominent angles or a "square-face" look, as well as 20 female and 22 male adult normal subjects were included, for a total of 150 hemimandibles for extraction of the inferior alveolar nerve. The nerve and the mandible were displayed. Point O was defined on the oblique line along the anterior cortex of ramus, where it intersected with a line extending from the alveolar arch. From the O point, linear distances were defined, including horizontal distances to the posterior cortex, oblique distances to the gonion, and the vertical distances to the inferior cortex. Mandibular width was defined as the distance between the 2 gonion points. Results demonstrated significant differences mainly in the oblique distances (ie, from the O point to the nerve [O1], from the nerve to the gonion [O2], and from the O point to the gonion [O1-O2]) in both female and male patients. The O2 distance was 23.69 mm versus 20.66 mm in women and 27.30 mm versus 23.28 mm in men (square face vs norm). The mandibular width was significantly larger in the male square-face patients, but the difference was not significant between the female groups. These results provide useful information for surgeons planning mandibular angle reduction. These findings suggest that the mandibular contouring procedure should be aimed at correcting regional osseous dysmorphology in the angle area and improving the relationship to the chin, rather than merely reducing the mandibular width.

### Static and dynamic coding in distinct cell types during associative learning in the prefrontal cortex [^2d640fd5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A debate is still ongoing concerning the mechanisms needed to maintain task-related information in memory through delay periods. At first, the dominant view was that the maintenance of information was conveyed by a persistent sustained activity by the cells involved in information coding,,,,,, establishing a static view of the representation conveyed at the population level as the hallmark of short-term memory. Such persistent activity has also been observed in relation to several other cognitive processes in addition to short-term memory. However, further evidence has challenged this view by demonstrating a more dynamic coding than previously thought,,,,. More recent studies have also shown that these coding schemes are not even mutually exclusive in a given brain area, but rather that they can coexistand be associated with distinct neuronal populations –, undermining the idea of rigid categorical separation and laying the foundations for conceiving mixed and heterogeneous representations in the prefrontal cortex. However, these recent studies lacked cell type classification, except in functional terms as linked to the intrinsic temporal properties of discharge in baseline periods,, and did not investigate whether these differences depend on cell types.

Here, we asked whether these heterogeneous representations could be associated with different processing properties of the cell types. To address this question, we used a statistical evaluation method of the off-diagonal reduction of accuracy to quantify coding schemes. The presence of an off-diagonal reduction indicates a certain degree of independence between activity patterns, and allows for the study of this coding property in different animal models,, and humans,. Our method considers the coding schemes not categorically but as a continuum between stability and dynamism aiming to capture the high variability of the activity patterns described in the delay periods, particularly in PFC,. We tested whether the two cell classes differed in terms of stability of their neural coding by characterizing their temporal coding properties during the IS period. In this period, based on the strategy implemented, a response was planned and maintained in memory as in a typical delayed response task but without turning off the visual response targets. The three squares are not considered to be a visual cue because they do not provide information about the correct target being presented.

### Quantitative analysis of the working windows for sitting and park bench positions through the retrosigmoid approach evaluated in a cadaver model [^f79b27cd]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The choice of the optimal surgical position in the treatment of posterior fossa lesions still remains a controversial and debated issue. Morphometric data on the different perspective of vision offered by different surgical position are scarce. This article investigated the differences due to the vision perspectives provided by the sitting and park bench positions.

Methods

The study was conducted using 4 fixed cadaver heads. A standardized retrosigmoid approach was performed on each side of each head. Three operators collected anatomic observation and 2 separate measurements each, for all the sides and diagonals of the projections of 2 areas delimited by the cranial nerves in the cerebellopontine angle (defined as working windows ABCD and ABEF). The collection of the measurements was repeated for each side of each head, both in the sitting and in the park bench positions. The average areas of the working windows were calculated for each position and then compared by statistical analysis.

Results

The park bench position is associated to larger areas for both working windows (P = .0013 for ABCD; P < .001 for ABEF) compared with the sitting position. These measures allow to quantify the differences of the working windows that are an indirect expression of the different angle of vision of each position.

Conclusion

Our cadaveric study shows that there is a better vision perspective offered by the park bench position for lesions that do not modify the course of the cranial nerves in the cerebellopontine angle. However, different positioning of patients presents different advantages and limitations for surgeon based on size of the tumor and lesion location. In our opinion, choice of patient positioning could be tailored to lesion's peculiarities more than on surgical habits.

### Modified technique using flexible iris retractors in clear corneal cataract surgery [^0047f4a0]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Flexible nylon iris retractors are a useful adjunct to cataract surgery in cases of small pupil. We present a modification of the standard technique. Instead of approaching the square-shaped pupil formed by iris retractors from the side, we recommend an approach anterior to 1 of the retractor hooks. From the surgeon's viewpoint, the pupil goes from a square shape to a diamond shape. This modification minimizes the likelihood of iris prolapse and iris damage during phacoemulsification and increases the workspace for the phacoemulsification needle.

### Classification and treatment of prominent mandibular angle [^5d341dbd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

In Oriental culture, the contour of the mandibular angle is important for feminine facial shape because a woman who has a wide and square face is thought to have had an unhappy life. A prominent mandibular angle, which does not coincide with the natural look, produces a characteristic quadrangle, coarse, and muscular appearance. So Oriental women who have a prominent mandibular angle want to have an ovoid, reduced, and slender face by aesthetic mandibular angle resection. Many satisfactory corrections of a prominent mandibular angle by various operative techniques have been reported. But reasonable morphologic classification and treatment were not reported. So we classified prominent mandibular angles into four groups by morphology and operated on the patients according to their classification with different modalities: no square shape but only a reduced gonial angle in the profile view-class I, mild form; severe mandibular angle protrusion with lateral protrusion-class II, moderate form; a definite square-shaped angle (class II) with masseteric hypertrophy-class III, severe form; and combined prominent mandibular angle and chin deformity-class IV, complex form. We use angle ostectomy through the intraoral route alone or with an additional external stab incision for class I. An external stab incision to set up the reciprocating saw is sometimes helpful in class I cases because there is no lateral protrusion of the angle. For class II cases, we use conventional intraoral angle ostectomy only or angle splitting ostectomy with contouring. For class III cases, we use angle splitting ostectomy and contouring with partial masseteric myectomy. In class IV, we use angle ostectomy and additional genioplasty. During 7 years, we have performed 46 cases of mandibular angle resection. Of the mandibular angle resection cases, 19 were class I, 15 were class II, 9 were class III, and 3 were class IV. A total of 42 patients were satisfied with the postoperative results. For reasonable and satisfactory final results, classification according to the mandibular angle shape and suitable treatment according to the classification are essential.

Two-gene model analyses on asthma in the SLSJ study for genes involved in the vitamin D pathway. The plot illustrates the p values for single SNP association and all possible two-SNP combinations. Each line represents a SNP listed at the left of the figure. Each column represents a SNP listed in the same order but from left to right. The white horizontal and vertical lines break up the figure by genes. Gene names are indicated at the right of the figure. P values are illustrated using the following color scheme: grey, p > 0.05; blue, 0.05 > p > 0.01; yellow, 0.01 > p > 0.001; orange, 0.001 > p > 0.0001, red, 0.0001 > p > 0.00001. The squares forming the diagonal (upper-left to lower-right) depict p values for single SNP association based on a Wald test (see materials and methods). Two-gene models for SNPs located in the same gene were not assessed and were not coloured, which created the large white square patterns along the diagonal. Illustrated above the diagonal are p values for the interaction term only, which are the results of Wald tests contrasting the full model (two main effects and the interaction) to the reduced model (two main effects only). Illustrated below the diagonal are p values testing the full model (two main effects and the interaction) against a reduced model that is conditional on single SNPs declared significant when taken individually, if any (see materials and methods). White squares illustrate tests for which the model failed to converge.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Uniform two-dimensional square assemblies from conjugated block copolymers driven by π-π interactions with controllable sizes [^e662883e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To control the scales of the achieved square micelles, we investigated the concentration dependence of the self-assembly of PPV 12 - b -P2VP n and the results were quite interesting. The scales of the formed square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 12 were significantly concentration dependent. The diagonal length of the square micelles formed in 0.01 mg ml −1 2-PrOH solution was ~2,750 nm, whereas the diagonal length was reduced to ~2,000 nm when the concentration of the solution was decreased to 0.005 mg ml −1. When the solution concentration was halved again, the diagonal length of the formed square micelles further decreased to only ~1,300 nm (Fig. 3a–c). The obtained 2-D square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 16 also showed concentration dependence, but the phenomenon was not as obvious as it was with the micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 12. The diagonal length of the square micelles formed in 2-PrOH solutions continued to decrease as the concentrations were halved from 0.01 all the way to 0.0025 mg ml −1 ; the diagonal lengths were ~ 1,950, 1,400, and 850 nm (Fig. 3d–f), respectively. When the P2VP blocks of the copolymer became longer, meaning that the R PPV/P2VP value was <1 : 2, the concentration dependence of the self-assembly of PPV 12 - b -P2VP n disappeared completely. For example, the diagonal lengths of the square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 22 formed in 2-PrOH solution with concentrations of 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01 mg ml −1 were all ~550 nm with very little variation. Similarly, the diagonal lengths of the formed square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 36 were only ~250 nm, which did not change when the concentration of the solution was decreased.

### Off-axis metasurfaces for folded flat optics [^1668cff1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To realize the off-axis-focusing metasurface reflector shown in Fig. 1a, a set of metagratings are optimized over the desired area of 2 × 2 cm 2 with a focal distance of 1 cm, resulting in a 90° × 90° angle-of-view or 110° diagonally. Up to this point, the work has investigated discrete positions along the metasurface’s0 cross-section, as seen in Fig. 2. To allow focusing in two dimensions, the surface-relief ridges are curved according to the grating equation generalized in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, the position and orientation of each element can be found by simply superimposing the electric field of an off-axis plane wave with a spherical wave centered at the desired focal distance. This second method is implemented to define the metasurface supercells’ pitch, position, and orientation. The metagratings are optimized by RCWA at 400 × 400 discrete points across the 2 × 2 cm surface under the assumption of an infinitely repeating supercell period at each position. This approximation is sufficiently accurate for large centimeter-scale metasurfaces given the slowly varying phase profile of a large parabolic mirror. The structure within each supercell is determined by the nearest optimized RCWA point, effectively creating 50 × 50 µm pixels where the optimized duty cycles are constant. These duty cycles are multiplied by the local pitch such that elements still vary in width across these rounded pixels. Figure 3a illustrates the resultant metasurface, though it is a scaled down 100 × 100 μm version to make the elements visible. This rescaling is achieved by analytically recalculating the grating pattern for a 50 μm focal distance and re-interpolating to the RCWA data. Upon inspection of Fig. 3a, the results of optimization are seen to produce an ensemble of all the metagratings building blocks previously explored in Fig. 2. Each element is denoted in order from light blue, dark blue, black, to red. The width of each element slowly varies with transitions occurring when the number of elements in a 2π phase-wrapped period changes. This is illustrated in the inset where the number of elements decreases from four to three. Figure 3b provides the simulated first-order diffraction efficiency of the metasurface as a function of position. The estimated mean efficiency is 95%, with a maximum of 98% and a minimum of 83%. A histogram of the efficiency distribution is included in Supplementary Fig. S3 of the Supplementary Information. In Fig. 3c, the diffraction efficiency is converted to normalized luminance in sRGB color space to illustrate the expected uniformity seen by the human eye. This is calculated using the CIE 1931 color matching function at 532 nm and converted from XYZ tristimulus values to sRGB color space values with gamma correction. These results demonstrate the design can achieve high diffraction efficiencies and uniformity for all output diffraction angles within the targeted NA.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^613bb44a]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The properties of the isosceles right triangle are of interest for the critical care physician teaching fellows for their first venous catheterizations. First, we can determine the needle insertion length required to reach the vein. According to this technique, the needle trajectory from the skin to the vessel corresponds to the hypotenuse of the triangle. For example, if the length ɭ is 2 cm, the needle will have to be inserted 2.8 cm (2 × 1.4) before it reaches the vein. This might help to check whether the needle length is sufficient, in particular for obese patients. Second, we can predict the position of the needle tip in the vein. Taking a distance between the probe and the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vessel, a probe perpendicular to the skin, and an angle between the skin and the needle of 45°, the third angle will be automatically positioned into the vein. A needle following the hypotenuse of this triangle should reach the center of the vein and make the puncture successful. Third, experts consider that an ideal needle/skin angulation is between 30 and 45°. If the vessel runs parallel to the skin interface, the needle–vessel angulation equals the skin–needle angulation: 45°. This limited angulation of the needle limits the risk of transfixiant puncture but also the risk of kinking of the guidewire during the subsequent dilation procedure.

### The alpha angle [^dbd5e95c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

➢ The alpha angle was originally defined on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, using a plane, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. However, much of the literature on the alpha angle has used radiographs or other imaging modalities to quantify the alpha angle.➢ The measurement of the alpha angle can be unreliable, particularly on radiographs and ultrasound.➢ If radiographs are used to measure the alpha angle, the circle of best-fit method should be used on multiple different views to capture various locations of the cam lesion, and "eyeballing" or estimating the alpha angle should be avoided.➢ The cam lesion is a dynamic and 3-dimensional (3D) problem and is unlikely to be adequately defined or captured by a single angle.➢ Modern technology, including readily available 3D imaging modalities, as well as intraoperative and dynamic imaging options, provides novel, and potentially more clinically relevant, ways to quantify the alpha angle.

### Modeling the electrical resistivity of polymer composites with segregated structures [^efc4bc6b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

Evaluation of diffusion rates

To analyze each trajectory, a point estimator for diffusion rate is derived for short intervals over the trajectory. We build on the covariance estimator (CVE) approach derived by Berglund et al. and related works –, and expand their work by incorporating an arbitrary time lag (j) within the theory and deriving alternative point estimators. The reasoning here is that in a single step, a trajectory with high temporal resolution at low photon counts is plagued by positioning noise and will benefit from a larger time step to let the diffusion step grow while being less influenced by the localization error. By moving up in the mean square displacement (MSD) curve, changes are accumulated and the positioning error is less dominant. The mean square displacement over an estimated trajectory { X k } is given by the mean over the square of steps Δ k, j = X k + j − X k and was shown by Berglundto be of the formwhen including motion blur and localization error. Heredenotes the mean over the parameter k, D is the diffusion constant, j is the number of steps, R is a blur factor, Δ t is the time of a single step, and σ is the positioning error. They continue and show that the covariance matrix between single steps, Δ k,1, has non-zero elements in the first off-diagonals. They use this relation to derive a point estimator for diffusion. In their treatment, the first step in the mean square displacement is given by the diagonal elements, and by taking the mean over the diagonal elements, they get the first point in the mean square displacement curve. Here we generalize their result further and obtain the covariance matrix for any time lag j and covariance between the steps Δ k, j. For derivation details, see Supplementary Note 2. After some calculations, the generalized covariance matrix is given bywhere j > 0 andwhich is the blur factor withwithas the shutter function. The covariance matrix, Eq. (4), tells us that moving along the mean square displacement curve (increasing j) indeed generates more non-zero off-diagonal elements, from Berglund’s single step (j = 1) with a single off-diagonal to a band of width 2 j for a step size of j. It is worth noting that the localization error (σ) is not present for the terms in between the main diagonal and the last. Deriving a simple estimator from this covariance matrix can be done in several ways. The CVE from Berglund et al. is obtained by solving for D and σ 2 when j = 1. Alternatively, but more complicated and computationally heavy, one can construct a maximum likelihood estimator similar to Shuang et al.but spanning more than one j step. See Supplementary Note 3 for a discussion on this topic. However, for our analysis, we note that for j > 1, the off-diagonals betweenare all independent of σ, and a simple estimator for diffusion would be to solve for D and σ 2 for a fixed value of. For the first off-diagonal,, and a time lag of j, the estimator iswhereis the mean along theoff-diagonal of the covariance matrix, Eq. (4). We will here refer to this estimator as the extended covariance estimator (ECVE). The localization error, σ, can be estimated by inserting the diffusion estimationinto the main diagonal,, and solving for σ 2. The ECVE estimator is compared to the CVE and the MSD in Supplementary Note 2. The conclusion is that the ECVE is more robust in presence of noise and has less bias compared to the MSD when evaluated over short sections of a trajectory.

### What are the reference values and associated factors for center-edge angle and alpha angle? A population-based study [^eb7e6d31]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The available evidence regarding normal ranges for the center-edge angle and the alpha angle derives from a few small studies, and associated factors such as sex and anthropometric factors have not been well evaluated. Knowing more about normal values for these parameters is critical, because this can inform decisions about when to perform elective hip preservation surgery. Population-level studies would provide considerable clarity on these issues, but to our knowledge, no such studies are available.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to use MRI in patients of a population-based study to establish normal values for the alpha and center-edge angles in the normal adult hip; and (2) to determine whether age, sex, or anthropometric variables were associated with differences in these values.

Methods

We used MRI images (1.5 T) of 3226 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP is a population-based study that started with 4308 participants in 1997. Participants were recruited randomly from official inhabitant data files as a stratified cluster sample of the population from a defined region in northeastern Germany. To ensure a representative epidemiologic cohort, stratification variables were sex, age, and city of residence. Between 2008 and 2012, 1094 of these participants underwent whole-body MRI with pelvic sequences in the second followup. In parallel, the next cohort, SHIP-Trend, started with the same protocol in which 2132 participants underwent MRI examination. Reference values were calculated by quantile regressions for the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Associations with the demographic features sex, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were analyzed by bivariate linear regression models.

Results

The mean center-edge angle was 31° (± 7°) with a corresponding calculated normal range of 17° to 45°. The mean alpha angle was 55° (± 8°) with a corresponding calculated normal range between 39° and 71°. Men (30° ± 7°) had a lower center-edge angle than women (32° ± 8°) (p < 0.001, β = 1.4°; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9°-1.9°) and a higher alpha angle (57° ± 8° versus 52° ± 7°, p < 0.001, β = 5.7°; 95% CI, 5.2°-6.3°). Moreover, a higher center-edge angle for the left side was found (33° ± 8° versus 30° ± 8°, p < 0.001, β =3.2°; 95% CI, 3.0°-3.4°). In addition to sex, we found that age, height, waist circumference, and BMI affected both center-edge angle and alpha angle. Weight was associated with the alpha angle as well. Because of these associations, age- and sex-adjusted reference values with belonging formulas were calculated.

Conclusions

The range of normal center-edge and alpha angles is quite wide. Therefore, only markedly abnormal angles may be associated with pathology. Moreover, center-edge angle and alpha angle are associated with age, sex, and anthropometric factors, which have to be taken into account for better interpretation.

Clinical Relevance

The association of abnormal radiographic values with true clinical hip pathology is tenuous at best. Assuming that a patient with an abnormal radiograph requires treatment is unwise. The clinical picture has to be substantial for therapeutic decisions.

### Nanoalignment by critical casimir torques [^56a0c077]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Enhanced microdisk localization and orientation by non-circular patterns

When trapped in the perpendicular configuration above a circular pattern, the microdisk is poorly localized in the xy-plane, as shown by the trajectory in Fig. 3 a. Such an unstable trapping is a consequence of the small overlap area between the microdisk and the substrate, resulting in a weak critical Casimir force. Moreover, as a consequence of the rotational symmetry of this system, the orientation of the microdisk freely diffuses featuring a uniform angular distribution, shown in the histogram in Fig. 3 d.

Fig. 3 
Microdisk position and orientation control by elliptical and circular patterns.

a Trajectory of a microdisk of radius R = 1.2μm trapped in the perpendicular configuration above a circular pattern of radius a = 1.1μm. The bottom panels in (a) show a micrograph of the trapped microdisk (left) and its schematic representation (right). The white solid line highlights the circular pattern on the surface, and the white dashed line highlights the microdisk oriented almost perpendicularly to the surface. The microdisk tilting leads to an ellipse-like, rather than a rectangular contour, as seen in the micrograph. The angle θ within the surface is measured between an arbitrarily chosen axis of the circular pattern (denoted by the short black vertical segment) and the projection of the microdisk diameter chosen to lie parallel to the surface. The shaded area shows the orthogonal projection of the microdisk onto the surface. The micrograph shows the top view while the schematic drawing presents a side view in order to provide a clearer illustration of the angle θ. b, c Normalized one-dimensional histograms of the microdisk displacements along the x - and y -directions. d The orientation of the microdisk in (a) defined by the angle θ is nearly uniformly distributed fromto. The dashed line shows the homogeneous probability density. e Trajectory of a microdisk levitating above an elliptical pattern (long axis 2.2μm and short axis 0.6μm). The bottom panels show the experimental picture (left) and the schematic representation (right) of the trapped microdisk. Similarly to panel (a), the solid and dashed lines highlight the contours of the surface pattern and of a circular microdisk oriented perpendicularly to the surface, respectively. The angle θ is measured as indicated in panel (a), taking the long axis of the ellipse as a reference axis. The microdisk displacements along the x -direction (f) are much more confined than along the y -direction (g). h The orientation of the microdisk is sharply confined between ca.and. The dashed line shows a Gaussian fit to the experimentallzy measured histograms (orange) with a mean value of θ ≈and a variance of 2.19(∘) 2. All scale bars correspond to 2μm. The temperature is close to T c, i.e. Δ T / T c ≪ 1. The white bars in (a) and (e) represent 2μm. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Neural substrates of parallel devaluation-sensitive and devaluation-insensitive pavlovian learning in humans [^3597fd8a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Pavlovian conditioning session

The task consisted of two learning runs lasting approximately 15 min each, both administered inside the scanner. Each run was composed of 60 trials for a total of 120 trials. At the beginning of each trial, four squares (6 ∘ visual angle each) highlighted by a white frame were displayed at the top and bottom horizontal center (18 ∘ visual angle on the x axis from the center) and the left and right vertical center (9 ∘ visual angle on the y axis from the center). These squares stayed on the screen for the whole duration of the trial.

Each trial was composed of (a) a cue presented for 1.5 s to 4.5 s in either the upper or lower white frames; (b) an empty screen with only the background white frames presented for 3 s; and (c) a video of the experimenter’s hand delivering their favorite snack into a small bag lasting 3 s. When the video appeared in either the left or the right white frame (see Fig. 1), a picture depicting the small bag without any action was displayed on the opposite side of the screen. If no video was displayed, both sides displayed a picture of the small bag without any action. The inter-trial interval consisted of a fixation cross and was presented for 4 s to 8 s (uniformly distributed).

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^b2d1eb3b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is notable that a Delaunay tetrahedron generates a point in the PD 2 plot only when its circumcentre lies inside its four triangular faces. Such a tetrahedron is called ‘well-centred'. The birth value is the largest circumradius of the four faces and the death value is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Circumradii of the triangular faces, ρ i, and of the tetrahedron, R, are related by ρ i = R sin(γ i) where γ i is the angle between the outward-pointing normal to face i and a radial line drawn from the tetrahedron circumcentre to one of the vertices on face i. The angles γ i can take any value in (0, π) so ρ i ∈(0, R), with ρ i = R when γ i = π /2 (and so have birth=death in PD 2). For a tetrahedron to be well-centred, however, we must have γ i < π /2 for all four faces. But the largest angle in any given tetrahedron must be greater than that for a regular tetrahedron, so. This means the circumradii of the faces of a well-centred tetrahedron satisfy ρ i ∈(R sin(γ max), R sin(π /2)), that is, ρ i / R ∈(/3, 1). This is quite a narrow strip in the persistence diagram PD 2 (/3=0.9428), and implies that any point (b, d) in PD 2 with d >3 b /must be due to a ‘pore' built from two or more Delaunay tetrahedra (that is, five or more beads in the bead-pack data).

Our bead packs are weakly polydisperse, and the variation in bead radii is compensated for by using the weighted DT (also known as a regular triangulation) based on the power distance to a ball B (z, r): d B (x)= d (x, z) 2 − r 2. The definition of alpha shapes carries over naturally to this setting.

Diffograms showing pairwise comparisons of body mass index standard deviation score trajectories for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and interleukin-18 in males (left), and for diastolic blood pressure and interleukin-6 in females (right) in late adolescence–young adulthood. The dashed diagonal upward sloping reference line depicts equality. The horizontal and vertical lines emanating from the axes indicate the location of the means of the four BMI trajectory groups. There are four vertical and four horizontal reference lines, and six pairwise comparisons of the means in males. There are three vertical and three horizontal reference lines, and three pairwise comparisons of the means in females. Each solid circle at the point of intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines shows the location of mean of two BMI trajectories and the associated diagonal line segment represents the Tukey–Kramer adjusted 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means. A confidence interval that intersect (red colour) the dashed diagonal line indicates that those two means are not statistically different and significant (blue colour) if otherwise. Mean displayed on the diffogram are on the exponents of cardiometabolic risk markers. Exponents: square root for HDL-c, inverse of the cube of fourth root for IL-18, cube of square root for DBP, and inverse of fourth root for IL-6

Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, “holes” appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

### A multivariate multilevel analysis of the risk factors associated with anthropometric indices in Iranian mid-adolescents [^017d066c]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The second data related to anthropometric measurements included body weight and height, BMI, TST, AST and SST. Height and weight were measured in all students, while wearing light clothing and no shoes, with 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg accuracy, respectively using tape measure and a SECA digital scale (Germany). BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m 2) and was classified based on the WHOs̓ growth charts. The subjects of the same sex and age with BMI less than 85th percentile, between 85th and 95th percentile and above 95th percentile were classified into three groups: normal, overweight and obese, respectively. A graded caliper was used to measure the ST in three sites of the body (triceps, abdominal, and subscapular). To measure the triceps, the technician bent the elbow to 90 degrees and marked the point midway between the top of the shoulder and elbow, and then measured a vertical fold by the caliper at a 90-degree angle on that midway point with the arm hanging naturally at the subject’s side. For AST measurements, vertical folds were measured at 2 cm to the right and left of the navel. Finally, a diagonal fold (calipers held at a 45-degree angle) was taken across the back, just below the shoulder blade to measure the SST. ST was measured on both right and left sides of the body separately, and the average of two measurements was recorded to the nearest 0.5 mm. All anthropometric measurements of the students were done by two trained technicians. Measurement was repeated by another technician if there was a great difference in the right and left sides.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^4530c378]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Healthy housing—exterior walls and siding materials note that in frame construction the base material of exterior walls is called sheathing, which may be square-edge, shiplap, tongue-and-groove boards, or plywood or oriented strand board (OSB), and that sheathing stiffens the frame to resist sway; for this reason it is applied diagonally to brace walls against racking. In older homes, asbestos-cement siding shingles can still be found, and asbestos and cement shingles used until the early 1970s are fire resistant but also a health hazard. Vinyl siding is manufactured from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which has provided impact-resistance, rigidity, and strength, but the use of vinyl siding is not without controversy because PVC is known to cause cancer in humans; accidental fires in vinyl-sided buildings are more dangerous because vinyl produces toxic vapors when heated. Cedar wood shingles and aluminum are manufactured with a backer board that gives insulation and fire-resistant qualities.

### Frank's sign and cardiovascular risk: an observational descriptive study [^3a7ec69a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study was undertaken to analyze the relationship between the diagonal earlobe crease and the main indices of cardiovascular risk, considering the crease's anatomical variations.

Methods

The study group consisted of 1050 adults residing in Spain. Participants underwent the following determinations: age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, blood pressure, glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular risk was calculated applying the Framingham-Anderson equation, the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation equation, and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score calculator. Both earlobes were examined, recording diagonal earlobe crease presence, length and depth, and presence of accessory creases. Results were analyzed by using chi-square test, Student's t test, analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests. To extract the functions of cardiovascular risk, a script in R was created (https://cran.r-project.org/).

Results

The estimated cardiovascular mortality risk was significantly higher in individuals who presented diagonal earlobe crease (P < .001). The number of individuals with moderate, high, or very high cardiovascular risk increased significantly as the presence of the crease increased (23.8% had no crease, 35.6% had unilateral creases, and 58% had bilateral creases; P < .001). The mean cardiovascular risk estimated was significantly higher for individuals with longest and deepest diagonal earlobe crease (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively), and with accessory creases (P < .001).

Conclusions

The diagonal earlobe crease is independently associated with higher cardiovascular risk scores, especially when the crease is complete, bilateral, deep, and has accessory creases.

### Improving genetic prediction by leveraging genetic correlations among human diseases and traits [^41a331b5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Therefore, if V SBLUP and C SBLUP can be approximated thenof Eq. (12) can be obtained from k single-traitestimates from Eq. (11).

To derive the approximations, we first consider the diagonal elements of V SBLUP, which comprise the variance of the SBLUP SNP solutions,. These can be approximated from theory under the assumption thathave BLUP properties, which in turn implies that. Following Daetwyler et al.and Wray et al. the squared correlation between a phenotype, y k, in an independent sample and a single-trait BLUP predictor of the phenotype,, is approximately:whereandis the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to additive genetic effects for trait k. Note that M eff is the effective number of chromosome segments or the number of independent SNPs, which is a function of effective population size (N e) and can be empirically obtained as an inverse of the variance of genomic relationships,. Here we use an estimate of M eff of 60,000, which is in line both with our estimates from the genomic relationships in our simulation data and with previously reported estimates. In Eq. (16),occurs on both the left- and righ-hand side. Solving forgives, where φ is.

With a phenotypic variance of 1 and individual-level genetic effects g k = Wb k, thenand the squared correlation between the true, g k, and estimated BLUP effects,, is:Rearranging Eq. (17) gives, which given the BLUP propertiesandwith a phenotypic variance of 1, reduces to=. Therefore:

Second, we consider the off-diagonal elements of V SBLUP, which are comprised of the covariance of BLUP SNP solutions among the k traits. These can again be approximated from theory given the covariance of genetic effects among traits k and l is cov(b k, b l) = r G h k h l / M, with r G the genetic correlation, and given the squared correlation between the true genetic effects of the SNPs, b k, andwhich is given by Eq. (17) as. The covariance of BLUP SNP predictors is then:

### Direct chiroptical correlation of dissymmetric crystal morphologies [^7a6b504a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One of the best views of the morphology comes from X-ray microtomography (microCT; Fig. 2D). Some of these crystals have several curious features. (1) The bipyramids are longer on the bottom than on the top, as pictured in Figs. 1 B2 and 2D. The length of the top pyramid is 75–80% of the bottom. (2) The bottom pyramid is more acute than the top, albeit this apparent angle depends upon the azimuth of the micrograph with respect to the vertical axis. The angle of the top pyramid is near 55° in projection, whereas the angle in the bottom pyramid is closer to 45°. These morphologies are consistent with the polar point group 6, as opposed to 622 where the top and bottom are equivalent. The sense of this axis could be a consequence of differences in mass transport that make some crystals appear polar. (3) The interfacial edges that separate the top and bottom pyramids have long and short bounding edges, horizontal and inclined, respectively. We have found that the best way to approximate this intersectionis with two types of pyramids: the bottom pyramid with isohedral facesand the top pyramid with enantiomorphous faces either {122} or {212}. In contrast, symmetry 622 with twelve {111} facets, i.e. symmetry 6 with six {111} facets and sixfacets, would give a bipyramid with edges between the large faces of top and bottom pyramids nearly parallel to the intersecting planes. The crystal face assignments been validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. S4). Interpenetrated twinned crystals (RR, LL, and RL) were also observed as clearly seen by micro-CT (Fig. S5).

### Is infundibuloureteropelvic angle (IUPA) a significant risk factor in formation of inferior calyceal calculi? [^ded517a9]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many studies confirm the fact that radiographic anatomy of inferior calyx has a significant role in the clearance of a stone lodged in it [Br. J. Urol. 50 (1978) 449; Invest. Urol. 18 (2) (1980) 167; BJU Int. 83 (Suppl) (1999) 24; J. Urol. 132 (1984) 1085]. Acutely angled and narrow infundibular neck of a inferior calyx has a poorer stone clearance in comparison to that with a less acute angled and wider infundibular neck [Br. J. Urol. 50 (1978) 449; Invest. Urol. 18 (2) (1980) 167; Br. J. Urol. 82 (1998) 12; BJU Int. 83 (Suppl) (1999) 24]. Incidence of bilateral stones in clinical practice is significantly less than unilateral stones. This study was taken up to define the significance of radiographic anatomy of the inferior calyx as a risk factor predisposing to stone formation in a patient and compared the anatomy of inferior calyx of the stone forming and contralateral kidney. The fact that inspite of the similar known etiological factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) of stone formation, why stone forms unilaterally?

Material and Methods

100 consecutive cases of non-obstructed unilateral inferior calyceal calculus with non-metabolically active stones were studied. The infundibuloureteropelvic angle (IUPA) and infundibular width of the stone forming and non-stone forming contralateral side were compared.

Results

IUPA of stone forming side was more acute than the non-stone forming side, in 74% of the cases, more obtuse in 18% of the cases, and same in 8% of the cases. The difference in the IUPA of the stone forming and that of non-stone forming contralateral side was statistically significant (p<0.0002). The infundibular width of the stone forming side ranged from 1 to 16 mm and that of non-stone forming side from 2 to 11 mm. There was no statistically significant difference between the infundibular width of both the sides. Exactly, how and more importantly under what influences the macromolecules in the urine transforms into a calculus in the pelvicalyceal system is still not known till date but from our observations we conclude that IUPA is a significant risk factor which predisposes to calculus formation in inferior calyx.

Conclusion

IUPA is a significant risk factor, which predisposes to urolithiasis in inferior calyx.

Termite prevention for homes—according to Potter, homeowners can reduce the risk for termite attack by adhering to the following suggestions: eliminate wood contact with the ground, do not allow moisture to accumulate near the home’s foundation, and reduce humidity in crawl spaces. Most building codes state that crawl space area should be vented at a rate of 1 square foot per 150 square feet of crawl space area; this rate can be reduced for crawl spaces equipped with a polyethylene or equivalent vapor barrier to one square foot per 300 to 500 square feet of crawl space area, and vent placement design includes positioning one vent within 3 feet of each building corner with a minimum of two vents per side.

The 3×1 unbiased sample mean and 3×3 unbiased sample variance–covariance matrix in equations 22 and 23 are estimators of the population parameters (mean and variance–covariance) given by

whererefers to the sample measurements in f -vector notation.

In equations 23–25 the sample size is N.(see equation 25) is also used indirectly in equation 22 as an estimate of the population variance–covariance. The population mean isandandrefer to the usual χ 2 and F -distributions. (The significance value,, provides the confidence level (1−)). In equations 22–25, coordinate vectors h or t (see equations 10–12) can be used in place of vector f.

Equations 22–25 are used to construct ellipsoidsthat are 3D equivalents of two-dimensional confidence regions. To do this for any distribution, the sample mean (in equation 24) and sample variance–covariance (in equation 25) are required as estimators of the population mean and population variance–covariance that typically are not known. An underlying assumption here is that the sample is normally distributed and thus the larger the sample size (n), the greater the probability that ellipsoids will be meaningful and a satisfactory representation of the necessary confidence regions in 3D SDPS for the distribution (raw data and the underlying population) or for the mean itself.

The sample variance–covariance (in equation 25) is a 3×3 symmetric matrix (see table 1 for examples of such matrices) that includes three variances along the diagonal of the matrix concerned and three covariances; either the upper or lower diagonal entries (becauseis symmetric).Unlike for an univariate quantity where only a single variance (or number) is necessary, with dioptric power and refractive behaviour six distinct numbers are needed to understand variation and covariation of the data or distribution along the coordinate axes in the 3-space concerned.Even then, this is an incomplete picture of variation of the distribution and other methods (see later polar profiles of varianceare necessary to get a complete understanding of sample variation. In SDPS (such as represented in figure 1) there are an infinity of directions for variation of the data and the variance–covariance matrix only provides information about variation along the three coordinate axes used in SDPS.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^3be75d54]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In bulk simulations of rounded cubes, we observed upon compression a transition from a plastic FCC crystal to a fully aligned C0 crystal. One of the main characteristics of the C0 phase is that the nearest neighbors do no longer align perfectly with the faces of the cubes but are shifted slightly off center. In Supplementary Fig. 15a, the position of the nearest neighbors is shown for the plastic crystal FCC phase and in Supplementary Fig. 15b for the C0 phase of rounded cubes in bulk for α = 0.3. Even in the case of the plastic crystal, the particles already have a preference for certain orientations, they avoid pointing their corners towards any of their neighbors. In the C0 phase the 4 spots (Supplementary Fig. 15b) in the center are caused by the off center position of these nearest neighbors resulting from the deformation of the unit cell and the alignment of the particles. However, when we compressed the same rounded cubes in spherical confinement we did not observe this transition, instead the particles remained in a more symmetric FCC/HCP position. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 15c (simulation) and d (experiment), where we plot the positions of the nearest neighbors for rounded cubes in confinement and observe a single bright spot in the center (neighbors aligned to the center of the faces).

Orientational correlations

The orientation of cube i is stored as a rotation matrix M. To quantify the orientation of the cubes with respect to neighboring cubes we want to calculate the minimum angle α ij required to rotate a cube with orientation M i into the same orientation as a cube with orientation M j. The angle between two orientation matrices can be obtained from the angle axis 1 + 2 cos α ij =but this would not take into account the symmetries of a cube. To do this, we need to calculate the symmetry group of the cube (or octahedron) S 4, which contains 24 rotationsthat preserve the orientation of a cube. To obtain the minimum angle, we then calculate the angle between all identical representations of the orientations of the cubeswhere f (x) = acos(Tr(x)/2 − 1/2) and the minimum is taken over all 24 members of the symmetry group.

Connecting particle color with its orientation

To obtain a visually interpretable effect, we color the particles by calculating the angle between the particle and three reference particles with different orientations. Detailed information can be found in Supplementary Methods Section 4.

### Local artery geometry characteristics associated with middle cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis [^853507cd]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The impact of artery geometry on intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) is unclear. To investigate the association between local artery geometry characteristics and middle cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis.

Methods

This was a case-control study. ICAS patients with more than 50% stenosis in one M1 pre-bifurcation segment but no significant stenosis on the other side were included. The stenosis degree, diameter, length, angle, and morphology (straight-shape, U-shape, and S-shape) of the M1 pre-bifurcation segments were measured by using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) combined with computed tomography angiography (CTA) and 3D reconstruction imaging. The geometry characteristics on both sides were compared. The conditional multivariate Logistics regression was used to investigate the association between stenotic sides and the geometry characteristics.

Result

A total of 133 patients, 266 M1 pre-bifurcation segments, were included. Compared with non-stenotic sides, stenotic sides showed smaller diameters (2.873±0.456 mm vs. 2.993±0.360 mm, P=0.002) and larger tortuosity index (7.61% vs. 6.45%, P=0.048). The S-shape M1 pre-bifurcation segment was independently associated with the stenotic sides (OR=3.509, 95% CI 1.176-10.468, P=0.024). The stenotic side was worse fitted to Murray's law (mean square error 0.326 vs. 0.313).

Conclusions

The morphology of the M1 pre-bifurcation segment was associated with middle cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis.

### Uniform two-dimensional square assemblies from conjugated block copolymers driven by π-π interactions with controllable sizes [^d260feb9]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Transmission electron microscopy

TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting 5 μl of the micelle-formed solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid followed by solvent evaporated. TEM micrographs were obtained on a Hitachi HT7700 microscope operating at 80 kV and equipped with an AMF-5016 charge-coupled device camera. For the statistical analysis, the obtained images were analyzed by using DigitalMicrograph software package developed by the US Gatan company. The diagonal length was calculated to characterize the scale of the platelet 2-D square micelles. Two hundred 2-D square micelles from TEM images were traced by hand. D n (number-average diagonal length) and D w (weight-average diagonal length) of each sample of platelet 2-D square micelles were determined from these data by using Eqs (1) and (2), respectively (where D i is the diagonal length of individual platelet 2-D square micelles, N i is the number of diagonal length D i).

HRTEM photographs were obtained on a Tecnai F30 microscope operating at 120 kV. Used TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting 5 μl of the micelle-formed solution onto a micro copper grid followed by solvent evaporated. SAED patterns for 2-D platelet square micelles were also collected by Tecnai F30 TEM.

Atomic force microscopy

The AFM samples for detecting were prepared by drop-coating about 15 μl of the 2-D square micelle solution onto a pre-cleaned and treated silicon wafer and evaporating the solvent 2-PrOH. The silicon wafers used for substrate were cleaned in piranha solution for 30 min, then ultrasound treated successively in ethanol, water, ultrapure water, and finally dried with blowing nitrogen. The images were obtained using an Asylum Research AFM in AC mode under ambient conditions. The used sensor cantilevers was Silicon probe reflex coated with aluminum manufactured by Budgetsensors Company. Images were analyzed using IGOR Pro software developed by WaveMetrics Inc.

Theoretical calculations

The ground state geometries were fully optimized by the DFT method with the Becke three-parameter hybrid exchange and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) and 6–31G* basis set using the Gaussian 09 software package.

### Surgical anatomy and variations of the infraorbital nerve [^378cd418]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To assess relevant variations in the anatomical course of the infraorbital nerve (ION). This understanding may reduce the risk of surgical injury.

Methods

A total of 100 consecutive computed-tomography sinus studies obtained in a tertiary referral center were reviewed, and measurements were made of the 200 IONs. Anatomic variants were classified into three types based on the degree to which (if any) the nerve's course descended from the maxillary roof into the sinus lumen.

Results

A total of 60.5% of IONs were entirely contained within the sinus roof. In 27.0%, the nerve canal descended below the roof but remained juxtaposed to it. In 12.5%, the ION descended into the sinus lumen. The proportion of IONs descending into the sinus significantly increased to 27.7% when an infraorbital ethmoid cell was present (chi-square P<0.001) and to 50% when the nerve was contained within a lamella of such a cell (chi-square P<0.001). Descended nerves terminated in a foramen located an average of 11.9±2.5 mm below the infraorbital rim, significantly further below the orbit than nondescended nerves (t test P<0.001). Descended nerves were located a mean distance of 8.6±2.9 mm below the sinus roof and traversed the sinus lumen diagonally for a mean length of 15.4±3.1 mm.

Conclusions

Descent of the ION into the maxillary sinus is a common anatomic variant that is more prevalent in the setting of an ipsilateral infraorbital ethmoid cell. Descended nerves are associated with the foramen significantly further below the inferior orbital rim than those of nondescended nerves. These observations may help surgeons avoid iatrogenic ION injury.
