## Question

Vbg normal ph, high Pco2 and bicarbonate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a venous blood gas showing normal pH with elevated PCO2 and elevated bicarbonate, and what the clinical implications and next steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acid-base pattern and whether this reflects compensation. Then, I should verify the reliability of venous versus arterial values for pH, PCO2, and bicarbonate. Next, I will consider the most likely etiologies, including chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation and mixed disorders. After that, I need to check for confounders and special contexts like obesity hypoventilation syndrome or diuretic use. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including when to obtain an arterial blood gas, what additional labs to order, and how to monitor and treat the underlying condition.

> Let me first confirm the acid-base pattern. Normal venous pH with elevated PCO2 and elevated bicarbonate typically reflects chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation, where the kidneys retain bicarbonate to normalize pH despite hypercapnia; this is a classic compensated respiratory acidosis pattern, and I should double-check that the direction of change fits this physiology before concluding anything definitive [^ddc37ac7] [^81b4c8bb].

> Wait, let me verify the reliability of venous values before I anchor on this interpretation. Venous pH and bicarbonate generally track arterial values closely, with small, predictable offsets; venous pH is about 0.03–0.05 units lower than arterial, and venous bicarbonate is within about 1–2 mmol/L of arterial, so a normal venous pH with high bicarbonate still supports a compensated respiratory process if the clinical context fits [^dfac2d68] [^5c21b02d] [^e0313155]. Hold on, I should verify PCO2 interchangeability; venous PCO2 is typically 5–8 mmHg higher than arterial, so a venous PCO2 around 50–60 mmHg corresponds to an arterial PCO2 around 42–52 mmHg, which is hypercapnic but may still be compatible with compensated chronic respiratory acidosis depending on bicarbonate and pH [^5a757d8c] [^e0313155].

> I will now examine the most likely etiologies. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the leading cause of chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation; other considerations include obesity hypoventilation syndrome, neuromuscular weakness, and chronic opioid or sedative use, all of which can produce sustained hypoventilation with renal bicarbonate retention and a near-normal pH despite hypercapnia [^ddc37ac7] [^2699404e]. But wait, what if the bicarbonate is high and the pH is normal for a different reason? Metabolic alkalosis from diuretics, vomiting, or exogenous alkali can raise bicarbonate and, via hypoventilation, increase PCO2 by about 0.7 mmHg for each 1 mmol/L rise in bicarbonate; this is expected respiratory compensation and would still yield a normal pH, so I need to check for alkali sources and chloride status before concluding a primary respiratory process [^8b39a269] [^81b4c8bb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the chronicity and look for mixed disorders. In chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation increases bicarbonate by about 3–4 mmol/L for every 10 mmHg rise in PaCO2, so if bicarbonate is markedly higher than expected for the degree of hypercapnia, I should suspect a concurrent metabolic alkalosis, whereas if bicarbonate is lower than expected, I should consider a mixed respiratory acidosis plus metabolic acidosis; this is where comparing measured bicarbonate to expected compensation is crucial [^81b4c8bb]. I need to ensure I also check the anion gap and electrolytes to exclude hidden metabolic acidosis or alkalosis that could shift bicarbonate independently of CO2 [^62f5f180].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and risk stratify. Let me consider obesity hypoventilation syndrome if the patient is obese with elevated bicarbonate, because serum bicarbonate greater than 27 mmol/L is a sensitive screening marker that should prompt arterial CO2 measurement to confirm OHS; conversely, a bicarbonate less than 27 mmol/L makes OHS unlikely and can help avoid unnecessary ABGs in low-probability patients [^2699404e] [^13341778]. I should also ask about diuretic use, vomiting, or alkali ingestion, and I should check for symptoms of hypercapnia such as morning headache, daytime somnolence, and cognitive slowing, which would reinforce a chronic ventilatory failure syndrome [^notfound].

> I should double-check oxygenation and ventilation dynamics. Pulse oximetry can be misleading in dark skin tones and in chronic lung disease, so if SpO2 is low or discordant with the clinical picture, I should obtain an arterial blood gas to assess PaO2 and the alveolar–arterial gradient; this is especially important if considering home oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, where accurate baseline arterial values guide therapy and monitoring [^a847f43c] [^04050419]. Let me reconsider the role of VBG for oxygenation; venous PO2 is not a substitute for arterial oxygenation assessment, so I must not rely on venous PO2 to make oxygenation decisions [^fbd6e0bf].

> Now, I need to ensure the right next steps. If the clinical pretest probability for hypercapnic respiratory failure is high, I should obtain an arterial blood gas to confirm the degree of hypercapnia and acid-base status, because venous PCO2 cannot be reliably converted to arterial PCO2 and management thresholds depend on arterial values; conversely, if the VBG shows a venous PCO2 less than about 45 mmHg, that effectively rules out clinically significant hypercarbia and can safely obviate an ABG in many cases [^5a757d8c] [^9d32ea43]. I should also order a basic metabolic panel to assess bicarbonate, electrolytes, and anion gap, and consider a chest radiograph, spirometry, or sleep testing depending on suspected etiology; if obesity hypoventilation is suspected, polysomnography with arterial CO2 monitoring is indicated to confirm sleep-related hypoventilation and titrate therapy [^2699404e] [^13341778].

> Let me think about monitoring and treatment principles. In chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, I should avoid overcorrecting oxygen because it can worsen CO2 retention; oxygen should be titrated to a target SpO2 of 88–92% with frequent blood gas checks to ensure ventilation is not deteriorating, and noninvasive ventilation should be initiated when indicated for chronic stable hypercapnia or during acute exacerbations with acidosis and hypercapnia [^a847f43c]. I should confirm that any metabolic alkalosis is addressed by correcting chloride, potassium, and volume status, and by removing exogenous alkali sources, because persistent metabolic alkalosis can perpetuate hypoventilation and hypercarbia, particularly in COPD [^8b39a269].

> In summary, I should confirm that this VBG pattern most likely reflects chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation, but I need to check for concurrent metabolic alkalosis and verify the clinical context before finalizing the diagnosis. The safest, evidence-based approach is to use VBG as a screening tool and obtain an ABG when results will change management, while systematically evaluating for reversible causes of hypoventilation and correcting contributing metabolic disturbances [^5a757d8c] [^62f5f180].

---

A venous blood gas with **normal pH, high PCO2, and high bicarbonate** indicates **chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation**. The kidneys retain bicarbonate to normalize pH despite persistent hypercapnia, producing a compensated respiratory acidosis. This pattern is common in **COPD, obesity hypoventilation, or neuromuscular disease**. Confirm with an **ABG** if results will change management, and treat the underlying cause; **avoid overcorrecting bicarbonate** to prevent worsening hypercapnia [^8b39a269].

---

## Physiological interpretation

- **Normal pH**: The kidneys have compensated for chronic hypercapnia by retaining bicarbonate, restoring pH toward normal.
- **High PCO2**: Reflects chronic hypoventilation (e.g. COPD, obesity hypoventilation, neuromuscular disease).
- **High bicarbonate**: Renal compensation increases bicarbonate to offset the respiratory acidosis.

---

## Clinical significance

This pattern is **most often due to chronic respiratory conditions** with renal compensation:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) | Chronic alveolar hypoventilation with renal bicarbonate retention |
| Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) | Hypoventilation from impaired respiratory mechanics with renal compensation |
| Neuromuscular disorders (e.g. ALS, myasthenia gravis) | Chronic hypoventilation with renal compensation |
| Chronic respiratory failure | Persistent hypercapnia with renal bicarbonate retention |

---

## Differentiation from other acid-base disorders

- **Acute respiratory acidosis**: Low pH, high PCO2, normal or slightly elevated bicarbonate (no renal compensation yet).
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: High pH, high bicarbonate, with compensatory hypoventilation (high PCO2) but pH remains alkaline.
- **Mixed disorders**: High PCO2 with normal or low pH suggests incomplete compensation or a mixed process.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Confirm with ABG**: If results will change management, obtain an arterial blood gas to confirm the diagnosis and severity [^5a757d8c].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Optimize COPD therapy, manage OHS (e.g. weight loss, CPAP/BiPAP), or address neuromuscular disease.
- **Avoid overcorrection**: Do not aggressively correct bicarbonate, as this can worsen hypercapnia and acidaemia [^9a0a28c2].

---

## Limitations of venous blood gas

Venous PCO2 is **typically 5–8 mmHg higher than arterial**, so a high venous PCO2 may overestimate arterial hypercapnia; interpret cautiously and confirm with ABG when results will alter management [^5a757d8c] [^e0313155].

---

A venous blood gas with **normal pH, high PCO2, and high bicarbonate** reflects **chronic respiratory acidosis with renal compensation**; confirm with ABG when needed and treat the underlying cause while avoiding overcorrection of bicarbonate.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^8b39a269]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood Pco2 owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated Hco3- levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

### Can VBG analysis replace ABG analysis in emergency care? [^5f525ca9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Blood gas analysis is an integral part of the assessment of emergency department (ED) patients with acute respiratory or metabolic disease. Traditionally ABG analyses have been used, but increasingly, emergency clinicians are using venous blood gas (VBG) analyses. This has been challenged, especially by respiratory physicians, as being too inaccurate. This clinical review, using case examples, summarises the evidence supporting use of VBG to guide management decisions. Arteriovenous agreement for pH is such that values are clinically interchangeable and agreement for bicarbonate is also close. Agreement for pCO2 is poor with 95% limits of agreement of the order of 20mmHg (2.67kPa); however, there is solid evidence that a venous pCO2 ≤ 45mmHg (6kPa) reliably excludes clinically significant hypercarbia. Evidence regarding arteriovenous agreement for base excess is unclear. Given knowledge of the performance characteristics of VBG analyses, integration of the clinical findings with VBG results is often sufficient to safely guide treatment decision making.

Acid-base assessment when arterial blood gas (ABG) cannot be obtained — The guideline notes "the need to assess acid-base status when an arterial blood gas cannot be obtained", stating that "A central venous sample or capillary sample is preferable to a peripheral venous sample" because "A peripheral venous sample reflects only local tissue consumption versus delivery". It adds, "When analyzed by an accurate instrument and in very specific clinical conditions, an adjusted central VBG or CBG may show sufficient agreement with some parameters of the ABG", and that "VBG and CBG analysis has been found to reliably predict the ABG values of pH, Pco2, and HCO3 in patients with exacerbation of COPD". It also states, "A peripheral venous blood sample can be used to evaluate the acid-base status in patients with uremia and diabetic ketoacidosis".

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^58e6d408]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Venous blood gas (VBG) versus arterial blood gas (ABG) — interchangeability and clinical use are restricted: VBG values should be interpreted as interchangeable with ABG only in very specific clinical conditions. Central venous oxygen saturation may not reliably predict (overestimate) mixed venous oxygen saturation in patients with severe sepsis in early goal-directed therapies. Available evidence suggests that there is good agreement for pH and HCO3 values between arterial and VBG results obtained from a peripheral vein in patients with COPD, but not for P_aO2, or P_CO2, and VBG pH and P_CO2 levels have relatively good correlation with ABG values, but cannot be substituted for ABG in exacerbation of COPD or in the setting of acute trauma. While a VBG may be used instead of ABG to determine pH, PCO2, and HCO3 in some diseases, such as respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, renal failure, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and status epilepticus, it should not be used as a substitute in other diseases such as neonatal seizure, shock, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart diseases. The presence of a high central venous-arterial PCO2 difference helps identify inadequacy of circulatory response as the one present in severe hemorrhagic shock, poor cardiac output, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and after cardiopulmonary bypass.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD

When a patient has suspected hypercarbic RF, hospitalists should obtain a VBG due to the ease, safety, and relative comfort of an VBG as compared to an ABG. Depending on the clinical case and pre‐test probability, hospitalists may proceed with treatment directed towards hypercarbic RF or obtain an ABG to confirm and quantify the hypercarbia. Hospitalists can rule out hypercarbic respiratory failure by finding a normal venous pH and PCO 2.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^3d726d02]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Blood gas analysis (BGA) description and variables — analysis of arterial and mixed venous blood provides information concerning oxygenation, ventilatory, and acid-base status, whereas samples from capillary, peripheral venous, umbilical venous sources and pH from other body fluids may provide limited information. The variables most generally measured are the P co2, P o2, and pH, and additional clinically useful variables include the concentration of total hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin saturation, saturations of the dyshemoglobins (carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin), and calculated or derived values such as plasma bicarbonate and base excess/deficit. While some evidence suggests venous and arterial pH, P co2, and HCO3 may be clinically comparable in certain settings, venous blood gas (VBG) obtained from a central line should be considered a surrogate for arterial blood gas (ABG) only in very specific clinical circumstances. Central venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation can reflect the relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption, and venous oximetry monitoring may reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing major surgery or patients with septic shock as it allows implementation of early goal-directed therapies.

### Understanding blood gas analysis [^f83bb734]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on blood gas analysis:

- **Definition**: Blood gas analysis is a common diagnostic tool to correctly interpret most of the respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic derangements through arterial and pulmonary/central venous blood gas and electrolyte analysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Blood gas analysis is used for the assessment of shunt fraction, pulmonary dead space, and respiratory, hemodynamic and metabolic relationship allowing for diagnosis and monitoring of critically ill patients.
- **Disease course**: Blood gas analysis is performed either through the arterial, central venous, or dual sampling of blood to assess oxygenation status, ventilatory and respiratory status, metabolic acid-base equilibrium disorders helping in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients in emergency departments and ICUs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Blood gas analysis is not associated with increased mortality.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 2: in patients presenting with an exacerbation of COPD can a normal venous blood gas pCO ₂ rule out arterial hypercarbia? [^9d32ea43]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

A shortcut review was carried out to establish whether a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) on a venous blood sample could be used to rule out hypercarbia. Eleven studies were directly relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that a normal venous pCO2 effectively rules out arterial hypercarbia.

### Diagnosis and management of severe respiratory acidosis: a 65-year-old man with a double-lung transplant and shortness of breath [^243943f7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, therefore requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis. A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest in contrast to primary circulatory arrest when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

### Comparing central venous blood gas to arterial blood gas and determining its utility in critically ill patients: narrative review [^e0313155]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is used in critical care units to determine the degree of oxygenation, adequacy of ventilation, and the presence and severity of acid-base disturbances in the body. However, arterial puncture may result in complications, and the difficulty in acquiring arterial blood may delay care. Central venous blood gas (VBG) is a potentially more accessible alternative to ABG sampling. Current evidence suggests that pH and Pco2 obtained via peripheral VBG correlate well with ABG measurement. Nevertheless, the value of using central VBG to guide clinical decisions or as a surrogate for ABG is unclear. The purpose of this review is to explore the relationship between ABGs and central VBGs in critically ill patients. We performed a MEDLINE search using the following search terms: venous blood gas, arterial blood gas, and central venous blood gas. We excluded studies that did not involve human subjects, and only pH and Pco2 values were reviewed and examined from the studies included. All cited references from included studies were also reviewed to identify relevant literature. We identified 7 studies that met our criteria. In studies of hemodynamically stable patients, the mean difference between arterial and central venous pH and Pco2 was 0.03 units and 4–6.5 mm Hg, respectively. However, in patients with circulatory failure, the difference between central venous and arterial pH/Pco2 was 4-fold greater. We concluded that central VBG parameters of pH and Pco2 are potentially good surrogates for determining arterial pH and Pco2 in a stable patient without severe acid-base disturbances. Furthermore, central VBG can be used as a useful screening tool for arterial hypercapnia. In addition, we derived an adjustment formula for ABG conversion from central VBG: (1) arterial pH = venous pH + 0.05 units and (2) arterial Pco2 = venous Pco2 - 5 mm Hg.

### Comparison of arterial and venous pH, bicarbonate, PCO ₂ and PO2 in initial emergency department assessment [^bb149df1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the agreement between arterial and venous samples in a pathologically diverse patient population presenting at an emergency department (ED) with a view to obviating the need for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis in initial ED evaluation.

Methods

Prospective study of 95 patients (69 males, 26 females, mean (SD) age 52 (1.6) years) with diverse medical conditions, presenting at a tertiary health centre ED and deemed by the treating physician to require an ABG analysis. Arterial and venous samples for gas analysis were taken as close in time to each other as possible. The data thus obtained were analysed for agreement between pH, Pco(2), Po(2) and bicarbonate using the Bland-Altman method.

Results

The arterial and venous values of pH, bicarbonate and Pco(2) show acceptably narrow 95% limits of agreement using the Bland-Altman method (0.13 to -0.1, 4.3 to -5.8 and 6.8 to -7.6, respectively). Agreement in Po(2) measurements was poor (95% limits of agreement 145.3 to -32.9).

Conclusion

Venous blood gas analysis for pH, bicarbonate and Pco(2) may be a reliable substitute for ABG analysis in the initial evaluation of an adult patient population presenting to the ED.

### Peripheral venous blood gas analysis for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and metabolic disturbance in adults [^4dd21b77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory failure (RF) and metabolic disturbance (MD), but peripheral venous blood gas analysis (PVBGA) is increasingly being used for the estimation of carbon dioxide, pH, and other variables in the context of acutely unwell adults presenting to hospitals and emergency departments.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the performance of PVBGA by comparing it with the reference standard ABGA, which is assumed to be error-free for the diagnosis of (1) respiratory failure, (2) hypercarbia, and (3) metabolic disturbance (the three target conditions) in adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of the index test to diagnose nine specific subtypes of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance. The definitions for these additional conditions are determined by changes to one or more of the following: pH (acidity), pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO 3 (bicarbonate), as stated in the Methods section of this review (target conditions). We aimed to explore the following covariates: participant demographics (e.g. age, weight, and sex); participant comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, chest wall deformity, and central nervous system disorder such as spinal cord injury); and the indication for blood gas sampling (e.g. shortness of breath, critical illness, resuscitation, trauma, or whilst under general anaesthesia).

Search Methods

On 10 July 2024, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also manually searched 19 respiratory and critical care journals, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered consecutive series studies and case-control studies that directly compared the index test PVBGA to the reference standard ABGA for adults over the age of 16 years. The included studies contained data for any one of the target conditions of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance, as determined by individual changes to pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and HCO 3 (bicarbonate) concentration. Studies that only provided mean values for summed data were ineligible for inclusion. However, we invited authors of such studies to provide individual patient data for inclusion in this systematic review. There are nine studies awaiting classification.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted data from them. We conducted a quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our statistical analysis used 2 x 2 tables for the positive and negative results of each test. We estimated a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity.

Main Results

We included six studies (919 participants) in our quantitative analysis. All studies were at high risk of bias due to one or more of the following factors: patient selection, since it was unclear if consecutive patients were included or where they were located; index test, with poor reporting of cut-offs; flow and timing domain because the fraction of inspired oxygen was frequently not stated and any difference between the collection of the VBGA and the ABGA could introduce bias. Respiratory failure For the diagnosis of respiratory failure of any type, when using PVBGA, the estimated summary sensitivity (Sn) was 97.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 94.1 to 99.4) and the estimated summary specificity (Sp) was 36.9% (95% CI 17.1 to 60.1) (6 studies, 805 participants of whom 291 (36%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure by ABGA; sensitivity: low-certainty evidence; specificity: very low certainty evidence). Isolated hypercarbia For the diagnosis of isolated hypercarbia (regardless of oxygen level), when using PVBGA, the estimated summary Sn was 97.1% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.2); the estimated summary Sp value was 53.9% (95% CI 39.8 to 66.7) (6 studies with 805 participants, 269 (33%) with ABGA confirmation; low-certainty evidence). Other findings Results for metabolic disturbance and our secondary target conditions are presented in the full review.

Authors' Conclusions

Very limited data suggest PVBGA performs poorly as a diagnostic test for respiratory failure compared to the reference standard of ABGA. The index test PVBGA was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia, but its specificity was poor for these two primary target conditions. The high sensitivity means PVBGA may have a useful role as a "rule out test" for respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia; however, the high false-positive rates make the clinical interpretation of a positive test difficult. Moreover, we are uncertain regarding these estimates because we have only low to very low certainty about the evidence. Further studies that use (ABGA) established thresholds for the diagnosis of each target condition are needed.

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^dfac2d68]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Identifying acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is crucial in the initial management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Guidelines recommend obtaining arterial blood samples but these are more difficult to obtain than venous. We assessed whether blood gas values derived from venous blood could replace arterial at initial assessment.

Methods

Patients requiring hospital treatment for an exacerbation of COPD had paired arterial and venous samples taken. Bland-Altman analyses were performed to assess agreement between arterial and venous pH, CO2 and HCO3-. The relationship between SpO2 and SaO2 was assessed. The number of attempts and pain scores for each sample were measured.

Results

234 patients were studied. There was good agreement between arterial and venous measures of pH and HC)3- (mean difference 0.03 and -0.04, limits of agreement -0.05 to 0.11 and -2.90 to 2.82, respectively), and between SaO2 and SpO2 (in patients with an SpO2 of > 80%). Arterial sampling required more attempts and was more painful than venous (mean pain score 4 (IQR 2–5) and 1 (IQR 0–2), respectively, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Arterial sampling is more difficult and more painful than venous sampling. There is good agreement between pH and HCO3- values derived from venous and arterial blood, and between pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas oxygen saturations. These agreements could allow the initial assessment of COPD exacerbations to be based on venous blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry, simplifying the care pathway and improving the patient experience.

### Comparison of pH and PCObetween arterial blood gas and venous blood gas in critically ill patients [^619f1962]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The reliability of peripheral venous blood sampling as a substitute for arterial blood sampling in determining the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in critically ill patients remains controversial. We aimed to determine the utility of venous blood in a medical intensive care unit population.

Methods

Seventy-six critically ill patients requiring arterial blood sampling as part of their standard clinical management were prospectively enrolled in this study. A venous blood sample was drawn from the same upper extremity within 5 min of the arterial blood sampling. Venous pH, pCO 2, and pO 2 were measured in venous samples and compared with those in their arterial counterparts.

Results

The venous pCO 2 was, on average, higher by 5.8 mmHg (standard deviation = 4.6 mmHg) than the arterial pCO 2 with Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement of -9.2, 9.2 mmHg.

Conclusions

Obtaining venous blood from an intact upper extremity in critically ill individuals can provide a reliable estimate of arterial pCO 2 and eliminate the need for invasive arterial blood sampling.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^5b540461]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hospitalists use blood gas analysis to evaluate respiratory and metabolic conditions. Information from blood gas testing can confirm or rule out diagnoses, assess the severity of conditions, and monitor treatments. Blood gases measure the pH, PCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) and PO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen); and provide calculated values including bicarbonate and base excess. Hypercarbia (or hypercapnea) may be identified on a blood gas and can be the result of respiratory failure. Acute exacerbations of COPD were the ninth most common primary discharge diagnosis in 2018 and are a frequent cause of hypercarbic respiratory failure. Collectively, this results in the regular use of a blood gas to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the hospital setting.

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^36341326]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Over the time course of the study (from 3 February 2013 to 10 January 2014), there were 1376 admissions with a coded diagnosis of COPD exacerbation. Of these, 234 participants were recruited and had at least one paired sample of blood gases. Twelve patients declined study participation. The mean age of the population was 71 years (SD 10.8) and 50% of the population was male. Characteristics of the population are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of study population

There was good agreement between arterial and venous pH, and between arterial and venous(figures 1 and 2 and tables 2 and 3), however, the CO 2 values varied significantly (figure 3). There was also a good agreement between SaO 2 and SpO 2 in those patients with an SpO 2 of ≥ 80% (figure 4 and tables 2 and 3). These relationships were not significantly different in the 20 patients with an admission systolic blood pressure of < 100 mm Hg (see online supplementary material).

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^23cd6a53]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

AARC blood gas analysis (BGA) and hemoximetry — guideline recommendations are based on a search of literature published between January 1990 and December 2012 and include 237 clinical trials, 54 reviews, and 23 meta-analyses. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for evaluating a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and/or oxygenation status, and are suggested for evaluating a patient's response to therapeutic interventions. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for monitoring severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease processes, and hemoximetry is recommended to determine the impact of dyshemoglobins on oxygenation. Capillary BGA is not recommended to determine oxygenation status, while central venous BGA and hemoximetry are suggested to determine oxygen consumption in the setting of early goal-directed therapies. For assessment of oxygenation, a peripheral venous P o2 is not recommended as a substitute for an arterial blood measurement (P aO2). It is not recommended to use venous P co2 and pH as a substitute for arterial blood measurement of P aco2, and pH, and it is suggested that hemoximetry is used in the detection and evaluation of shunts during diagnostic cardiac catheterization.

### Agreement between arterial and central venous values for pH, bicarbonate, base excess, and lactate [^5c21b02d]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the extent of agreement between central venous and arterial values for pH, bicarbonate, base excess, and lactate in a group of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

A prospective study of a convenience sample of patients deemed by their treating doctor to require blood gas analysis as part of their clinical care in ICU. It compared pH, bicarbonate, base excess and lactate on arterial and central venous samples taken within five minutes of each other. Data were analysed using bias (Bland-Altman) methods.

Results

A total of 168 matched sample pairs from 110 patients were entered into the study. All variables showed close agreement. The mean difference between arterial and venous values of pH was 0.03 pH units, for bicarbonate 0.52 mmol/l, for lactate 0.08 mmol/l, and for base excess 0.19 mmol/l. All showed acceptably narrow 95% limits of agreement.

Conclusion

Central venous pH, bicarbonate, base excess, and lactate values showed a high level of agreement with the respective arterial values, with narrow 95% limits of agreement. These results suggest that venous values may be an acceptable substitute for arterial measurement in this clinical setting.

### Carbon dioxide levels in neonates: what are safe parameters? [^e6523bd7]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a physiological gas produced as a consequence of aerobic metabolism. Plasma CO 2 levels are tightly regulated under physiological conditions to maintain blood pH. CO 2 is mainly removed from the body via the lungs and can accumulate in lung pathologies. In humans, normocapnia is defined as a pCO 2 of between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa (35.3–45.0 mmHg), with pCO 2 reflecting the balance between CO 2 production and removal. Consequently, slightly higher pCO 2 values are associated with the venous circulation as CO 2 -enriched blood is returned towards the lungs. Importantly, the local microenvironment of cells and tissues can experience pCO 2 levels that differ markedly from systemic PaCO 2, e.g. in solid tumours. This is likely a consequence of local metabolic activity and alterations in local blood supply. Adaptive responses to changes in CO 2 can be classified as being acute or chronic. Acute responses to CO 2 are generally sensed through brain stem central chemoreceptors that modulate the rate and depth of breathing to try and maintain normocapnic partial pressures of CO 2. Chronic responses to CO 2 can be elicited on a cellular level through CO 2 -dependent changes in gene expression, e.g. genes associated with immune signalling. The cerebral vasculature is very sensitive to physiological gases. Given the brain's significant demand for oxygen to maintain normal function, several adaptive cerebral vasodilatory mechanisms are elicited to promote and maintain cerebral blood flow under conditions of hypoxia. Elevated CO 2 levels, which are frequently associated with hypoxia, also promote an increase in cerebral blood flow through dilation of cerebral arteries and arterioles. In contrast, hypocapnia leads to vascular constriction and reduced blood flow. Thus, the cerebral vasculature is highly sensitive to the level of circulating physiological gases with hypocapnia and hypercapnia capable of affecting brain oxygen levels indirectly through modulation of cerebral blood flow.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^6c0e7795]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Venous blood gases (VBGs) are safe and effective at screening for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Multiple studies have validated that a VBG with a PvCO 2 less than 45 reliably rules out hypercarbia. The use of VBGs for the initial screening of hypercarbia when hypercarbic respiratory failure is suspected can reduce the overall use of arterial blood gases which are more painful and take more time and expertise to perform.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^a7639e86]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In another study of 89 patients presenting with acute exacerbation of COPD, a screening PvCO 2 cut‐off of 45 mmHg for hypercarbia also showed a 100% sensitivity and a specificity of 34%. Expanding further on the specificity of the PvCO 2, the original prospective study by Kelly et al. noted that greater a PvCO 2 greater than 55 mmHg was over 88% specific for hypercarbia. A low pH on VBG, which is highly specific for acidosis, and a normal bicarbonate, would further support the case for hypercarbia. Said another way, a PvCO 2 of less than 45 mmHg safely excludes hypercarbia as a reason for a patient's somnolence. A PvCO 2 value of 45 mmHg or greater may prompt the hospitalist to treat the patient or confirm the presence of hypercarbia with an ABG depending on the clinical picture (see Figure 1).

Figure 1
Recommended algorithm for evaluation of hypercarbic respiratory failure in the hospitalized adult.

VBGs can also evaluate the impact of hypercarbia treatments. While investigators have found that trending PvCO 2 does not correlate precisely with changes in PaCO 2, a study using VBG and ABG information showed very limited differences in clinical interpretation and no differences in respiratory management in intubated patients in the emergency department. Established hospital COPD protocols include serial VBG testing to assess the benefit of NPPV.

Additionally, obtaining an ABG has associated risks and can lead to patient discomfort. The VEINART study randomized 113 patients to ABG or VBG and measured patients' reports of pain on the visual analog scale. This study demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in patient‐reported pain with VBGs (14.3 mm difference, 95% confidence interval 8.1–25.3 mm). ABG sampling also carries risks of hematoma, aneurysm formation, thrombosis or embolization, and needlestick injuries. In many institutions, only specifically trained medical personnel draw ABGs, which creates a challenge for urgent samples. It is difficult to place a precise monetary value on the impact of reducing the number of ABGs ordered given that some of the benefits are indirect (less use of specialized providers to obtain the labs) or patient‐care centered (less pain, less risk of complications). Certainly, the benefits of testing reduction are in line with the broader discussions around high value care which appropriately focus on quality, cost, and overuse.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^4c49de3d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, the v-TAC calculation is based on a compensation for normal aerobic metabolism. The method assumes peripheral venous sampling is taken from a limb with a clearly recognisable pulse and a normal capillary response. It would not be suitable in clinical scenarios characterised by additional anaerobic metabolism at the tissue site. In the setting of haemodynamic instability or sepsis, for example, then arterial sampling is preferred. We also emphasise here that calculation of higher values of PO 2 via v-TAC is not as robust as for pH and PCO 2. For other patient cohorts, where O 2 evaluation is critical, then an arterial sample remains most appropriate.

Second, the single-centre nature of our study limits its generalisability. There are a growing number of single-centre studies that show successful application of the v-TAC method. These have served to establish the safety and reliability of the method and to refine the patient groups most likely to benefit. Ultimately, it could replace most, but not all, arterial samples for some patient groups. This would be quite a significant change in the patient pathway given that arterial sampling is the current gold standard. We believe that the available data support the introduction of v-TAC-directed pathways into clinical care, though would recommend that implementation should be assessed via service evaluation or further study.

One of the issues of comparing against a gold standard is in assuring the gold standard itself. Arterial sampling is subjected to known errors, and it would not be sensible to compare against a non-physiological sample. We considered significant venous admixture and sedimentation to be the two main preanalytical errors that might affect an ABG result. We used conservative criteria to exclude clear examples of preanalytical error, without excluding those with more equivocal changes. Using our criteria, we excluded 8/133 (6%) of presumed arterial samples on the grounds of venous contamination.

There is also inherent variability of sampling even when the sample is clearly arterial. As a pragmatic study, we accepted that patients were unlikely to be physiologically stable from a respiratory perspective at the time of sampling. We did not tend to use local anaesthesia for ABG sampling and recognise this as a weakness against national standardsthough not in comparison to usual practice in the UK. Transient hyperventilation or breath-holding around the time of blood sampling is commonand may affect ABG results; our post hoc analysis suggests that this may have been the case for up to 15% of ABG samples obtained.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^0cc3074b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Background

Blood gas analysis with measurement of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) is essential in the assessment of a critically ill patient with respiratory failure. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are the accepted reference technique for the assessment of pCO 2; however, they are painful, technically challenging and require expertise to obtain. Venous blood gases (VBGs) are often obtained with any initial venous punctureand in our experience are often used alone in the initial assessment of ventilatory status.

There is agreement in the literature for the use of VBG instead of ABG for the assessment of pH, lactate, and bicarbonate for both centraland peripheral VBGs.

VBGs are a useful screening tool for respiratory function with pCO 2 > 45 mm Hg being 100% sensitive for detecting the presence of hypercarbiaand a pCO 2 < 30 mm Hg being 100% predictive to rule out the presence of hypercarbia. However, venous (pCO 2 v) and arterial pCO 2 (pCO 2 a) are not interchangeable for further assessment as the limits of agreement (LOAs) are unacceptably wide ranging from −17.4 to +26 mm Hg(although some authors suggest closer agreement). In addition, pCO 2 v and pCO 2 a do not have a consistent relationship to permit a simple conversion factor.

Several authors have suggested that pHor pCO 2 may be useful for trending change in respiratory status, although reliance on pCO 2 v instead of ABG is likely to lead to unnecessary ventilator adjustment in intubated patients. One study looking at trending suggested that the agreement for absolute change was reasonable for venous pH, but not for pCO 2 v due to the wide LOAs.

Recently, a method has been developed that allows the estimation of ABG values from venous samples based on mathematical modelling of oxygen utilisation and thus carbon dioxide production in the tissues based on haemoglobin, peripheral oxygen saturations and venous oxygen saturations. Using an estimate of the respiratory quotient and oxygen extraction, the pCO 2 a is then estimated from the pCO 2 v. Mathematically arterialised or calculated VBG can be calculated to within clinically acceptable criteria of the arterial blood gas values for pH and pCO 2. The remaining variability is similar to that seen within serial arterial blood sampling and within laboratory acceptable performance criteria. Calculated arterial values from peripheral venous blood have been found to be more accurate than those taken from central venous bloodand caution is recommended when transforming central venous blood samples.

### Hyperventilation and finger exercise increase venous-arterial pco2 and pH differences [^3a4c63f2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the invention of the pulse oximeter, physicians often or even routinely perform venous blood gas analysis (VBGA). However, it has not been generally agreed that the application of VBGA is practically meaningful in routine clinical situations such as in an ED.

Methods

We measured venous-arterial Pco(2) difference ((v-a)Pco(2)) and arterial-venous pH difference ((a-v)pH), and analyzed the physiological factors that affect these differences in healthy volunteers and hyperventilation patients.

Results

In healthy volunteers, both (v-a)Pco(2) and (a-v)pH increased during finger exercise or hyperventilation in an intensity-dependent manner. Doppler echography indicated that increases in (v-a)Pco(2) and (a-v)pH during hyperventilation are induced by reduction of peripheral blood flow. Approximately 40% of patients with untreated respiratory alkalosis were found to be incorrectly diagnosed if based only on VBGA.

Conclusions

It must be noted that VBGA may lead to overestimation of acidosis and to underestimation of respiratory alkalosis when extremities muscles are active or patients are hyperventilating. Physicians should keep these limitations in mind when conducting VBGA.

### Agreement between central venous and arterial blood gas measurements in the intensive care unit [^4213596d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis is a safer procedure than arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and may be an alternative for determining acid-base status. The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between ABG and central VBG samples for all commonly used parameters in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We performed a single-center, prospective trial to assess the agreement between arterial and central VBG measurements in a medical ICU. Adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and required both a central venous line and an arterial line were enrolled. When an ABG was performed, a central venous sample was obtained to examine the agreement among the pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate. Data comparing central and peripheral VBG values were also obtained.

Results

The mean arterial minus venous difference for pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate was 0.027, -3.8, and -0.80, respectively. Bland-Altman plots for agreement of pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate showed 95% limits of agreement of -0.028 to 0.081, -12.3 to 4.8, and -4.0 to 2.4, respectively. Regression equations were derived to predict arterial values from venous values as follows: Arterial pH = -0.307 + 1.05 x venous pH, arterial Pco(2) = 0.805 + 0.936 x venous Pco(2), and arterial bicarbonate = 0.513 + 0.945 x venous bicarbonate. The mean central minus peripheral differences for pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate were not clinically important.

Conclusions

Peripheral or central venous pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate can replace their arterial equivalents in many clinical contexts encountered in the ICU.

### Re-evaluation of total CO ₂ concentration in apparently healthy younger adults [^369c9890]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of acid-base status is usually based on the measurement of total CO2 concentration ([TCO2]) in venous blood, a surrogate for [HCO3-]. Previously, we posited that the reference limits of serum [TCO2] in current use are too wide. Based on studies on the acid-base composition of normal subjects, we suggested that the reference limits of serum [TCO2] at sea level be set at 23–30 mEq/L. To validate this proposal, we queried the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA's) Integrated Clinical and Research Data Repository, a database containing information on 4.5 million patients seen at UCLA from 2006 to the present. Criteria for inclusion included adults (18–40 years of age), who were free of disorders that could affect acid-base balance, were not taking medications that could affect acid-base balance, and were seen for a routine medical examination or immunization in the outpatient setting. The number of individuals who met the inclusion criteria (52% female and 48% male) was 28,480, with a mean age of 28.9 ± 5.1 years. The mean serum [TCO2] level was slightly higher in males than females, 26.6 ± 2.16 mEq/L vs. 25.0 ± 2.11 mEq/L (p < 0.05). Ninety-one percent of patient values were within the proposed 23–30 mEq/L range and 61.7% were within the 24–27 mEq/L range. These findings validate our proposal that the reference range of serum [TCO2] in venous blood at sea level be narrowed to 23–30 mEq/L. Subjects with serum [TCO2] outside this range might require assessment with a venous blood gas to exclude the presence of clinically important acid-base disorders.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^81b4c8bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Physiologic homeostasis in a living human after pig kidney xenotransplantation [^dec3b50e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Acid-Base Balance

The recipient developed moderate metabolic alkalosis, evidenced by high venous pH (7.46–7.48) and elevated serum bicarbonate levels (33–39 mmol/L) in the absence of respiratory alkalosis (pCO2 52−59 mmHg) (Supplemental Fig. 4A). Persistent diuretic use for volume management, high-dose oral calcium carbonate, and pulse-dose intravenous corticosteroids — administered at transplant and during rejection treatment — likely contributed to this imbalance.

Urinary chloride concentration remained elevated (> 20 mmol/L), while urine pH was low (5.5–6.0) (Supplemental Fig. 4B). In the setting of ongoing diuretics use, serum potassium levels were mostly within the normal range but remained in the low-normal range after POD 36, requiring daily potassium supplementation (Supplemental Fig. 4C). Urinary potassium excretion was elevated, with a urine potassium/creatinine ratio consistently > 18 mmol/g during this period.

### Correlation of simultaneously obtained capillary, venous, and arterial blood gases of patients in a paediatric intensive care unit [^95013a5d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the correlation of pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate (HCO3) between arterial (ABG), venous (VBG), and capillary (CBG) blood gases.

Methods

Patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Cukurova University between August 2000 and February 2002 were enrolled.

Results

A total of 116 simultaneous venous, arterial, and capillary blood samples were obtained from 116 patients (mean age 56.91 months, range 15 days to 160 months). Eight (7%) were neonates. Sixty six (57%) were males. pH, PCO2, BE, and HCO3 were all significantly correlated in ABG, VBG, and CBG. Correlation in PO2 was also significant, but less so. Correlation between pH, PCO2, PO2, BE, and HCO3 was similar in the presence of hypothermia, hyperthermia, and prolonged capillary refilling time. In hypotension, correlation in PO2 between VBG and CBG was similar but disappeared in ABG-VBG and ABG-CBG.

Conclusions

There is a significant correlation in pH, PCO2, PO2, BE, and HCO3 among ABG, VBG, and CBG values, except for a poor correlation in PO2 in the presence of hypotension. Capillary and venous blood gas measurements may be useful alternatives to arterial samples for patients who do not require regular continuous blood pressure recordings and close monitoring of PaO2. We do not recommend CBG and VBG for determining PO2 of ABG.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^5a757d8c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

WHY YOU MIGHT THINK AN ABG IS THE BEST TEST TO ORDER

Many physicians learn about blood gas testing during their preclinical years. Lecture material and test questions refer to ABG analysis as a crucial step in determining the primary acid base disturbance and assessing for appropriate compensation. For instance, "First Aid for the USMLE Step 1" makes no mention of VBGs.

ABG analysis, the gold standard for measurement of acid–base, oxygenation and ventilation status, provides the PCO 2 of arterial blood, which is proportional to CO 2 production and inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation.PCO 2 measurement is often useful to hospitalists assessing a patient's respiratory status or response to a metabolic process.

While VBGs can obtain all the values of an ABG, hospitalists cannot interchange them. A review of 13 studies comparing ABG and VBG values for 2009 patients found a weighted mean difference in pH of −0.033 for a VBG compared to an ABG. The study found a 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of approximately ± 0.1, suggesting good agreement between ABG and VBG. Therefore, adding 0.033 to a VBG pH can estimate an ABG pH. On the other hand, VBGs do not accurately predict PCO 2 as well as ABGs. In the same review, 8 studies assessing 965 patients found a weighted mean difference of 6.2 mmHg (a PvCO 2 typically reports approximately 6.2 mmHg higher than a PaCO 2), but the 95% LOA vary widely, falling between −17.4 to 23.9 mmHg. Even though these two values correlate well, hospitalists cannot uniformly convert the partial pressure of venous CO 2 (PvCO 2) to a PaCO 2.

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^23b627f0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

While bicarbonate has a high sensitivity for daytime hypercapnia in OHS, its sensitivity and the negative predictive value of a bicarbonate within normal limits for sleep hypoventilation are only moderate. Since the detection of sleep hypoventilation is important in obesity and NMD/CWD, an optimal screening tool should be sensitive. The positive likelihood ratio for hypoventilation increases significantly from the HCO 3- upper limit of the normal, and it is therefore helpful in risk groups for hypoventilation when it is elevated, despite not having optimal specificity. Sensitivity is higher in those taking diuretics. Bicarbonate is an essential part of the assessment of patients at risk of hypoventilation but must be interpreted in conjunction with other assessments.

### AARC clinical practice guidelines: capillary blood gas sampling for neonatal and pediatric patients [^08018013]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guidelines — capillary blood gas sampling for neonatal and pediatric patients — specify handling limitations and validation steps: undue squeezing of the puncture site may result in venous and lymphatic contamination; a second puncture may be needed to obtain adequate blood; variability in capillary partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) values precludes using these samples for assessing oxygenation status; the sample must be anticoagulated and obtained anaerobically with the capillary tube filled completely and air bubbles expelled immediately; the sample should be immediately chilled or analyzed within 10–15 minutes if left at room temperature; a respiratory assessment of the patient should be documented in the medical record at the time the capillary sample is performed; and an arterial sample may be analyzed to compare with the capillary pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) values.

Potential Harm from Bicarbonate Administration

Although it may seem intuitive to treat all metabolic acidoses with bicarbonate supplementation, there are several ways that sodium bicarbonate administration can potentially cause harm. Excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate has been associated with decreased availability of oxygen at the tissue level due to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Although rare, aggressive bicarbonate therapy may result in alkalemia, causing increased binding of calcium to albumin, leading to a drop in ionized calcium levels and subsequent depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. In addition, due to the hyperosmolar nature of the solution sodium load associated with these preparations, patients may experience fluid shifts, notably pulmonary and cerebral edema. It is also important to note that the use of sodium bicarbonate relies on the ability of the patient to have effective ventilation. The bicarbonate anion combines with hydrogen ions to ultimately form CO 2. If minute ventilation is restricted, preventing adequate exhalation of CO 2, excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate may inadvertently cause hypercarbia and paradoxically lower the pH. Peripheral vein thrombophlebitis is another potential cause of iatrogenic complications from rapid administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, particularly in situations with faulty peripheral intravenous catheters, although recent data suggest that lower concentrations may not cause localized injury.

### Pseudohypobicarbonataemia [^f2b43f5a]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) is obtained to assess acid-base disturbances, measure arterial oxygen (PO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2). ABG uses blood gas analysers, which have electrochemical sensors, to calculate plasma bicarbonate (HCO3), from the pH, PCO2 and PO2. Bicarbonate levels can also be measured on routine electrolyte studies such as the basic metabolic panel (BMP) or comprehensive metabolic panel. These methods typically use enzymatic/electrode methods to calculate bicarbonate levels. Generally, there is an acceptable correlation between the bicarbonate measurement from blood gas and from metabolic panel. Rarely, there is a discrepancy. The following is a case of pseudohypobicarbonataemia, where BMP consistently showed hypobicarbonataemia and ABG revealed normal levels.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^62f5f180]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^8e28874b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is essential in the management of hypercapnic respiratory failure, but sampling is painful, depending on operator expertise. Patients often require multiple samples over time to assess therapy response. Use of local anaesthetic is rare in UK ward-based practice despite longstanding recommendations for its use in national guidance. This recommendation was reinforced in the British Thoracic Society's 2017 guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings, which recommended (grade A) use of 'local anaesthesia for all ABG specimens except in emergencies'.

Arterialised capillary blood gas (CBG) samples present an alternative to this accepted standard, though their reliability and accuracy are uncertain. Venous blood gas (VBG) pH sampling can screen acutely unwell patients, but has less precision for PCO 2. VBG testing does not replace subsequent ABG sampling if treatment with acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is considered.

A newer venous to arterial conversion method (v-TAC, Roche) is available for clinical use. It calculates arterial acid–base status from VBG measurements combined with blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) from standard pulse oximetry using mathematical models of acid–base chemistry. Peripheral venous blood is mathematically transported back through the tissues adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide in a fixed ratio until oxygen levels match measurements taken from the pulse oximeter. A mathematical model of acid–base is applied to perform this calculation, which accounts for the oxygen dissociation curve, calibrating this to the venous blood, and for the Bohr-Haldane effects in the blood. The model calculates 'arterialised' values of pH, PCO 2, PO 2 and SO 2 assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.82, and adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide until the calculated SO 2 is equivalent to measured SpO 2. The method essentially aims to compensate for the effects of aerobic metabolism. It is important to note that v-TAC calculations of arterial PO 2 are inaccurate when the plateau of the oxygen dissociation curve is reached, typically when SpO 2 is greater than 97%.

### Correlation of central venous and arterial blood gas measurements in mechanically ventilated trauma patients… [^acddb4f1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Results When VBG and ABG values were compared, pH had R = 0. 92, P <. 001, and 95% LOAs of −0. 09 to
0. 03; PCO2, R = 0. 88, P <. 001, and 95% LOAs of −2. 2 to
10. 9; and base excess, R = 0. 96, P <. 001, and 95% LOAs of −2. 2 to 1.
8. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed that a central venous PCO2 of 50 mm Hg had 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity for determining significant hypercarbia. Conclusions Central venous and arterial PCO2, pH, and base excess values correlate well, but their LOAs represent clinically significant ranges that could affect management. Although VBGs cannot be substituted for ABGs in mechanically ventilated trauma patients during the initial phases of resuscitation, clinically reliable conclusions can be reached with VBG analysis. The information obtained from an ABG analysis includes pH, PCO2, PO2, oxygen saturation, base excess, and bicarbonate levels. The Table presents a summary of the PCO2, pH, and BE values obtained from 99 sets of VBG and ABG measurements. For PCO2, the mean VBG value was 45. 0 ±
6. 9 mm Hg compared with an ABG value of 41. 0 ±
7. 4 mm Hg. Similarly, our data demonstrate that central venous and arterial PCO2, pH, and BE values correlate satisfactorily to well, but their 95% LOAs represent clinically significant ranges that could affect management decisions in critically ill patients during the initial phases of resuscitation from injury. However, we conclude that these data support the utility and reliability of VBGs in mechanically ventilated patients in the recovery phase from injury, where the combination of a normal central venous pH and a PCO2 of 50 mm Hg or less may be used to rule out a significant respiratory acidosis.

### High total carbon dioxide predicts 1-year readmission and death in patients with acute dyspnea [^a2002e8d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients with acute dyspnea are a large heterogeneous patient group where initial management is important for outcome.

Objectives

The objective of the study is to investigate if venous blood gas parameters predict 1-year risk of readmission or death in patients admitted to the emergency department due to acute dyspnea.

Methods

We studied 283 patients with acute dyspnea and followed them up for 1 year regarding incidence of readmission or death.

Measurements and Main Results

In venous blood obtained immediately upon admission levels of total carbon dioxide (TCO2), base excess (BE), potential hydrogen (pH), and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) were measured. In Cox proportional hazards models, patients belonging to top and bottom quartiles of TCO2, BE, pH, and pCO2 were compared to patients belonging to the 2 central quartiles and assessed for end point. After adjustment, top (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–2.04; P = 0.016) and bottom (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.08–2.18; P = 0.017) quartiles of BE were associated with increased risk of readmission or death. The strongest predictor was top quartile of TCO2 (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.21–2.35; P = 0.002). In the combined analysis, top quartile of TCO2 remained significantly related to the end point (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03–2.45; P = 0.035), whereas BE became nonsignificant. Comorbidities, for example, prevalent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, did not explain the association. Neither pCO2 nor pH predicted the end point.

Conclusions

A high value of TCO2 appears to be an easily accessible marker for 1-year readmission or death in patients with acute dyspnea and may thus add clinically important information for risk stratification and follow-up strategies.

### Guiding resuscitation in shock: base excess or lactate? [^f980be2d]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Base excess (BE) is a widely used parameter derived from blood gas analysis. A recent international study showed that 40% of surveyed anesthesia and critical care clinicians use BE to guide (intraoperative) fluid management, and that 25% of respondents prefer BE over lactate. This is surprising as lactate production is directly increased by hypovolemia-associated tissue hypoxia, whilst BE is a simple calculation of the metabolic component of acid-base derangement.

In the 1960s, measuring lactate was laborious and time-consuming: a typical colorimetric measurement of lactate took up to eight hours, clearly limiting its clinical point-of-care use. At the same time, Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen introduced BE, a marker to quantify metabolic acid-base derangements independent of concomitant carbon dioxide variations, i.e. respiratory acid-base disorders. Modern BE is a simple mathematical expression that corrects changes in bicarbonate for carbon dioxide variation by using the slope of an experimentally determined carbon dioxide titration curve.

### Disorders of acid-base balance [^fc2f8510]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intensivists spend much of their time managing problems related to fluids, electrolytes, and blood pH. Recent advances in the understanding of acid-base physiology have resulted from the application of basic physical-chemical principles of aqueous solutions to blood plasma. All changes in blood pH, in health and in disease, occur through changes in three variables: carbon dioxide, relative electrolyte concentrations, and total weak acid concentrations. However, while this quantitative approach has enjoyed widespread use among researchers, clinicians are reluctant to employ it. Recent advances have brought a measure of parity between the newer and the older, descriptive approach to acid-base physiology.

Data Synthesis

Case-based review of the literature.

Conclusion

Both quantitative and traditional approaches can be easily combined to result in a powerful tool for bedside acid-base analysis.

### Supporting hemodynamics: what should we target? What treatments should we use? [^ff11aa37]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

When all of the compensatory mechanisms are overcome, the hemodynamic failure is overt and its marker is the appearance of metabolic acidosis associated with increased plasma lactate concentration. We believe that the best approach to understand the relationship between metabolic acidosis and lactate in tissue hypoxia has been provided by Hochachka and Mommsen, who elegantly showed how lactate production and ATP hydrolysis are coupled and must be considered together. Here it is enough to say that the appearance of acidosis indicates the energy failure of a group of cells that, in the absence of correction, may result in cellular death after a few hours.

Figure 3 reports the impressive relationship between metabolic acidosis and mortality in a general population of critically ill patients. In contrast, elevated metabolic alkalosis, usually caused by diuretic therapy, is not associated with increased mortality. Beyond pH, several approaches have been proposed to assess the hemodynamic failure, such as base excess, lactate, decreased strong ion difference (SID), increased anion gap, increased venous to arterial difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) and its ratio to the arterial-venous oxygen content. All these variables, however, are just different facets of the same reality; that is, the perturbation of the acid-base equilibrium due to nonvolatile acid load, originating from suffering cells (lactate) or dead cells (intracellular strong acid content is higher than plasma content). In mammalians, when metabolic acidosis starts due to the hemodynamic failure, the time for correction is limited before irreversible mitochondrial damages and cell death occurs.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^ce19f8f3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Figure 3
Arterial PCO 2 changes due to NIV compared with the changes seen for VBG (column A), v-TAC (column B), and CBG (column C). Categorical agreement (for example, a reduction in PCO 2 in both comparators) was 86% for VBG, 91% for v-TAC, and 61% for CBG. R 2 values were highest for v-TAC (0.61). CBG, capillary blood gas; VBG, venous blood gas; v-TAC, venous to arterial conversion.

We then considered the potential impact of unstable ventilation around the time of ABG sampling. We defined relative hyperventilation and hypoventilation as follows:

Hyperventilation: pHa-pHv ≥ 0.09 and PCO2a-PCO2v ≤ −1.5 kPa.

Hypoventilation: pHa-pHv ≤ −0.01 and PCO2a – PCO2v ≥ 0.1 kPa.

Using these criteria, we found evidence of hyperventilation for 8/119 paired samples, and hypoventilation for 10/119 paired samples (ie, total affected = 18/119 (15%) samples).

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^1c9e434a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

### Utility of venous blood gases for the assessment of traumatic shock: a prospective observational study [^2bbf4d79]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

ABG samples are often obtained in trauma patients to assess shock severity. Venous blood gas (VBG) sampling, which is less invasive, has been widely used to assess other forms of shock. The study aim was to determine the agreement between VBG and ABG measurements in trauma.

Methods

Patients were enrolled at an Australian trauma centre between October 2016 and October 2018. Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) between paired blood gas samples taken < 30min apart were used to quantify the extent of agreement. The impact of using only VBG measurements was considered using an a priori plan. Cases where venous sampling failed to detect 'concerning levels' were flagged using evidence-based cut-offs: pH ≤ 7.2, base deficit (BD) ≤ -6, bicarbonate < 21and lactate ≥ 4. Case summaries of these patients were assessed by independent trauma clinicians as to whether an ABG would change expected management.

Results

During the study period 176 major trauma patients had valid paired blood gas samples available for analysis. The median time difference between paired measurements was 11min (IQR 6–17). There was a predominance of men (81.8%) and blunt trauma (92.0%). Median Injury Severity Score was 13 (range 1–75) and inpatient mortality was 6.3%. Mean difference (ABG-VBG) and LOA between paired arterial and venous measurements were 0.036 (LOA -0.048 to 0.120) for pH, -1.27mmol/L (LOA -4.35 to 1.81) for BD, -0.64mmol/L (LOA -1.86 to 0.57) for lactate and -1.97mmol/L (LOA -5.49 to 1.55) for bicarbonate. Independent assessment of the VBG 'false negative' cases (n = 20) suggested an ABG would change circulatory management in two cases.

Conclusions

In trauma patients VBG and ABG parameters displayed suboptimal agreement. However, in cases flagged as VBG 'false negative' independent review indicated that the availability of an ABG was unlikely to change management.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^03c010e1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Venous blood gases in the assessment of respiratory failure in patients undergoing sleep studies: a randomized study [^27eca973]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Venous blood gases (VBGs) are not consistently considered suitable surrogates for arterial blood gases (ABGs) in assessing acute respiratory failure due to variable measurement error. The physiological stability of patients with chronic ventilatory failure may lead to improved agreement in this setting.

Methods

Adults requiring ABGs for sleep or ventilation titration studies had VBGs drawn before or after each ABG, in a randomized order. Veno-arterial correlation and agreement were examined for carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2), pH, oxygen tension (PO 2), and oxygen saturation (SO 2).

Results

We analyzed 115 VBG-ABG pairs from 61 patients. Arterial and venous measures were correlated (P < .05) for PCO 2 (r = .84) and pH (r = .72), but not for PO 2 or SO 2. Adjusted mean veno-arterial differences (95% limits of agreement) were +5.0mmHg (-4.4 to +14.4) for PCO 2; -0.02 (-0.09 to +0.04) for pH; -34.3mmHg (-78.5 to +10.0) for PO 2; and -23.9% (-61.3 to +13.5) for SO 2. VBGs obtained from the dorsal hand demonstrated a lower mean PCO 2 veno-arterial difference (P < .01). A venous PCO 2 threshold of ≥ 45.8mmHg was > 95% sensitive for arterial hypercapnia, so measurements below this can exclude the diagnosis without an ABG. A venous PCO 2 threshold of ≥ 53.7mmHg was > 95% specific for arterial hypercapnia, so such readings can be assumed diagnostic. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 indicated high discriminatory capacity.

Conclusions

A venous PCO 2 < 45.8mmHg or ≥ 53.7mmHg would exclude or diagnose hypercapnia, respectively, in patients referred for sleep studies, but VBGs are poor surrogates for ABGs where precision is important.

2.2. Definitions of Outcomes

DKA was defined using the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes 2018 guidelines: plasma glucose > 200 mg/dL, venous pH < 7.3 or serum bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, and the presence of ketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate [BOHB] ≥ 3 mmol/L) or ketonuria (≥ 2+ or "moderate or large"). The diagnosis of suspected CABI was based on deterioration in neurologic status leading to initiation of hyperosmolar therapy or endotracheal intubation or radiologic evidence of cerebral edema.

2.3. Collection of Variables

The following biochemical variables on presentation were collected: venous pH, partial pressure of venous carbon dioxide (pCO2), plasma BOHB, serum bicarbonate, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and osmolality, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). In the few cases where an initial arterial blood gas was obtained, we calculated venous pH as arterial pH – 0.05 and venous pCO2 as arterial pCO2 +6 mmHg. If serum bicarbonate was not available, the bicarbonate concentration from a venous blood gas analysis was used. Corrected sodium was computed as (glucose − 100) × 0.016. Anion gap was calculated as sodium–(chloride + bicarbonate). Effective osmolality was calculated as (2 × sodium) + (glucose/18). To determine the change in HbA1c from baseline, a follow-up HbA1c was collected at least 12 months after the initial value obtained on presentation.

### Reliability of central venous blood gas values compared with arterial blood gas values in critically ill patients [^37b41437]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous blood gas (cVBG) values are correlated with arterial blood gas (ABG) values. However, the substitution of cVBG values for ABG values in critically ill patients remains uninvestigated. Thus, we investigated the reliability between cVBG and ABG values and sought to define the conditions that could improve the reliability of cVBG values as a substitute.

Methods

We conducted a prospective comparison of 292 sets of cVBG values and ABG values from 82 subjects admitted to the medical ICU between October 2017-July 2018. Paired cVBG and ABG samples were collected daily during the first 5 d of ICU treatment and on days 8, 15, 22, and 29. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) were obtained.

Results

The ICC between ABG and cVBG was 0.626 for pH, 0.696 for P CO2, 0.869 for bicarbonate, 0.866 for base excess, and 0.989 for lactic acid. Bland-Altman plots showed clinically unacceptable LOA between all parameters. Subgroup analysis indicated a significant increase in the ICCs of P CO2 in samples with mechanical ventilation (0.0574–0.735, P = 0.02) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) ≥ 70% (0.611–0.763, P = 0.008). After adjustment, the 95% LOA between ABG and cVBG was -0.06 to 0.07 for pH and -7.09 to 7.05 for P CO2 in mechanically ventilated subjects with ScvO 2 ≥ 70%.

Conclusions

ABG and cVBG values showed clinically acceptable agreements and improved reliability in mechanically ventilated subjects with ScvO 2 ≥ 70%. cVBG analysis may be a substitute for ABG analysis in mechanically ventilated patients once tissue perfusion is restored.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and venous blood gas values… [^8f5f23c3]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis consists of elevated blood glucose, measurable ketone bodies and metabolic acidosis. Arterial blood gas determination is considered essential in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Arterial blood sampling is painful, may be technically difficult and must be done in addition to venous sampling when testing for electrolytes and other values. The general correlation between arterial and venous pH measurements is well established, although this correlation has not been studied in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Brandenburg and Dire prospectively studied the relationship between arterial and venous blood gas values in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Thirty-eight patients with 44 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis who presented to an emergency department with blood glucose levels greater than 250 mg per dL, urine dipstick results positive for ketones and clinical suspicion of diabetic ketoacidosis were included in the study. Arterial and venous samples were obtained as temporally close to each other as possible for blood gas analysis. The mean difference between arterial and venous pH values was 0.
03. Arterial and venous pH results, arterial and venous bicarbonate measurements and arterial bicarbonate and serum carbon dioxide results were also closely correlated. The authors conclude that the peripheral venous pH measurement is a valid and reliable substitute for arterial pH in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. A potential disadvantage of using venous determinations to determine the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis is that it may be more difficult to detect when mixed acid-base disturbances are present, since venous blood values may not reflect hypoxia in patients with respiratory depression.

In patients with suspected mixed acid–base disorders or evidence of respiratory depression or hypoxemia on pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis remains an appropriate means of testing for diabetic ketoacidosis. To ensure that venous sampling does not underestimate the degree of acidosis, a larger patient sample would be needed to examine more patients with severe acidosis. In addition, a study of final patient outcomes is necessary to determine whether the use of venous rather than arterial gas values affects outcome.

### Reply by cove and kellum to swenson [^a61b9b54]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Editorialists:

We thank Prof. Swenson for his well-articulated letter. We conceded in our editorial that the Stewart approach doesn't provide a strong mechanistic explanation, and therefore we also agree it doesn't eliminate a mechanistic role of bicarbonate. Rather, the Stewart approach provides a unifying explanation of the factors determining plasma pH by incorporating the role of electrolytes, plasma proteins, and carbon dioxide in all forms, including bicarbonate. Whether one considers bicarbonate to be dependent and P 2 independent, or vice versa, depends on the system under examination. Thus, we do not think this a useful classification and avoided the terms in our editorial because we've shown P 2 behaves like a dependent molecule under some circumstances. However, the classification does serve the purpose of drawing attention to the fact that P 2 and HCO 3 are not independent of each other. Furthermore, the Stewart approach is not at odds with our understanding of membrane ion transporters; instead, it provides a more complete understanding of their function.

In the paper by Zanella and colleagues, normal pH was restored after induction of acidosis by removing chloride to increase the strong ion difference; this also led to an increased bicarbonate level. Both of these changes can be easily understood with the Stewart approach, whereas a bicarbonate-centric approach focuses only on the bicarbonate change that occurred. Therefore, if we simply considered the information on the blood gas, we could only classify the acid–base changes in the Zanella experiments as metabolic, respiratory, or mixed, but we would be unable to describe what had caused the observed changes. Similarly, in clinical practice, a bicarbonate-centered approach allows us to identify the presence of an acid–base derangement as effectively as the Stewart approach. However, the Stewart approach provides a more precise classification of the acid–base changes, even in the studies referenced by Prof. Swenson. Such precision is important in clinical practice where, for example, the impact of choice of resuscitation fluids on acid–base status needs to be considered. We flatly reject the assertion that teaching the Stewart approach is difficult or that it leads to increased costs and blood loss. In fact, the variables needed to apply the approach are routinely measured already. The value of the approach comes from the ability to understand the relative contributing effects of simultaneous abnormalities on the final observed pH, such as elevated lactate, hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte abnormalities, in a way that bicarbonate-centric understanding cannot.

Blood gas analysis

The performance of arterial blood gas (ABG) or capillary blood gas (CBG) during the rest phase and immediately postexercise adds additional benefit when investigating the cause of unexplained exertional breathlessness. Hyperventilation and gas exchange abnormalities can present with similar response patterns, that is, raised ventilatory slope, raised ventilatory equivalents and reduced end-tidal carbon dioxide levels. However, to accurately distinguish between these response patterns, it is essential to understand whether there is a wide alveolar to arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (P (A-a) O 2) and/or a wide end-tidal to arterial difference in carbon dioxide (P (a-ET) CO 2) and hence the need for blood gas sampling. Oxygen saturation levels recorded by pulse oximetry are not accurate enough in all subjects to allow accurate distinction. If one or both of these are wider than the expected normal, then this is highly suggestive of a gas exchange and/or dead space problem.

Additionally, clinically relevant information on arterial carbon dioxide tension, pH, bicarbonate and blood lactate levels can be obtained from arterialised blood gas sampling at rest and immediately postexercise. The ratio of physiological dead space ventilation (V D) to tidal ventilation (V T) can be calculated by the metabolic system using the measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension. V D /V T provides further assessment of the efficiency of gas exchange. Although most metabolic systems will provide a calculated V D /V T without measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension, this is based on end tidal gas tensions and should be considered inaccurate.

It is important that the blood is collected while the patient is connected to the mask/mouthpiece and breath samples are being recorded. The metabolic system must be notified at the point at which the sample is collected so the breath values can be directly compared with the blood sample values. This ensures an accurate comparison between arterial gas values and gases being inspired/expired. For details on the performance of ABGs/CBGs, please see the ARTP Statement on Lung Function 2020.

Blood gas analysis

Introduction

Blood gas sampling and analysis play a vital role in the diagnosis of clinical problems and monitoring of possible treatment modalities such as supplemental oxygen (O 2) or assisted ventilation.

Blood gas analysis can measure several indices, which can aid diagnosis when interpreted in relation to the clinical state of the patient. Blood gases reflect the ability of the cardiopulmonary system to maintain the relationship between cellular respiration and supply of O 2 and elimination of carbon dioxide (CO 2) via the lungs.

Nomenclature

This nomenclature was taken from Rowe and Arrowsmith(A, alveolar; a, arterial; Fi, inspired fraction; P, partial pressure exerted; S, saturation).

Directly measured

P a O 2: measured using a polarographic (Clark) electrode. Hb is the major carrier of O 2, each molecule binding four molecules of O 2. A small amount of O 2 is dissolved in blood, but it is this fraction that diffuses through capillaries to supply tissues. P a O 2 is the partial pressure of undissolved oxygen, which is in equilibrium with dissolved oxygen.
P a CO 2: measured using a Severinghaus electrode. CO 2 is carried as bicarbonate (60%), with proteins (30%) and dissolved (10%).
pH: measured using a pH electrode. pH = −log 10 ([H +]): the negative logarithm of [H +]. pH falls as [H +] rises. pH 7.0 corresponds to [H +] 100 nmol/L. A change of one pH unit represents a tenfold change in [H +].

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^3832f856]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Venous blood cut points for managing acute exacerbations of COPD

Given the relationships observed, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of a VBG pH andto correctly identify an arterial pH of ≥ 7.35, and an arterialof ≥ 21, as well as an SpO 2 to identify an SaO 2 of ≥ 92% (table 4). A venous pH of 7.34, a venousof 21.45 and an SpO 2 of 91.5 would have correctly classified 87% (95% CI 82% to 91%), 97% (95% CI 93% to 98%) and 71% (95% CI 65% to 77%) of patients, respectively. In terms of specificity, 96% of patients with an ABG pH of ≥ 7.35 also had a VBG pH of ≥ 7.35 (tables 5 and 6).

Table 4

Table 5
Predictive performance of venous blood gas parameters

Table 6
Predictive performance of pulse oximetry

We used current oxygen guidelinesto calculate how many ABG samples may have been avoided if the venous cut points were used instead. Of our 234 patients, 72 (31%) had a venous pH < 7.35. Of the 162 with a venous pH ≥ 7.35, only two had an arterial pH of < 7.35.

Consequently, we estimate approximately two-thirds of ABGs can safely be avoided in the initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. This figure does not factor in the repeat attempts needed to obtain arterial blood. Using these data, we suggest a new algorithm for the management of COPD exacerbations based on the current guidelines (figure 5).

Timing of samples

We assessed the mean difference in time between the paired arterial and venous samples to see if a delay between samples had an effect on the relationship between ABG and VBG parameters. The mean time difference was −4.18 min, SD 16.92, range −58.98 to 78.64 min (arterial–venous). Given the range, we repeated our analysis using the 168 paired samples that were performed within 15 min of each other. This did not affect the relationships (see online supplementary table).

### Bicarbonate reduces serum prolactin increase induced by exercise to exhaustion [^8e7d6411]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of acid-base status on serum prolactin (PRL) concentration postexercise.

Methods

Seven male recreational athletes participated in two experimental trials separated by 1 wk. In the respective trial, subjects received either a placebo infusion (normal isotonic saline) or an alkali infusion (isotonic sodium bicarbonate) before and during exercise. Venous and capillary blood samples were drawn at rest, immediately after a 10-min warm-up period, and after a maximal ramp test on a cycle ergometer, as well as at 3, 6, 10, and 15 min postexercise.

Results

Power output, HR, capillary blood lactate concentration, carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), and partial oxygen pressure (PO2) did not differ between trials at any point in time. Capillary PO2 did not change from resting values, but a significant increase (P < 0.05) was found from the end of warm-up to 3 min of the recovery period. Exercise induced a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in capillary blood bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-), pH, base excess (BE), and PCO2 at exhaustion and during the recovery period. Significantly higher HCO3-, pH, and BE were found during bicarbonate infusion and postexercise in comparison with the placebo trial. Serum PRL concentration was significantly increased 3 min postexercise until the end of the placebo trial, whereas after bicarbonate infusion, serum PRL concentration did not change from values at rest. Significant (P < 0.01) differences between trials in serum PRL concentration were found 10 and 15 min postexercise.

Conclusions

The present study suggests that acidosis is a stimulus for exercise-induced PRL secretion.

### Deconstructing hyperlactatemia in sepsis using central venous oxygen saturation and base deficit [^42caf369]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperlactatemia and Arterial pH

According to the "strong ion" theory, lactate is a strong anion and thus should be completely dissociated from hydrogen in plasma, generating an acidosis. However, some patients with sepsis and hyperlactatemia have a concurrently decreased pH (acidemia), whereas others maintain a normal pH. This suggests mechanisms that enable relatively rapid respiratory or metabolic compensation. Gattinoni and colleagues found that the ability to maintain a normal pH despite elevated lactate levels was more closely correlated with renal function than with respiratory compensation. They propose that an indirect measure of the accumulation of renally excreted fixed acids in plasma — the "alactic base excess" — could be used to assess the kidneys' ability to compensate for acid-base disturbances.

The standard base excess, defined as the amount of strong acid that must be added to each liter of oxygenated blood to return the pH to 7.40 at a Pa CO 2 of 40 mm Hg, quantifies the degree of metabolic acidosis or alkalosis independently of respiratory compensation. Contributors to base excess include lactate, strong ions such as sodium and chloride, albumin, and ions that accumulate in renal failure, such as phosphate and sulfate. By adding lactate to the standard base excess, the authors arrive at the alactic base excess, which they assert quantifies "the role of renal function in the acid – base balance in sepsis".

This suggestion is certainly interesting but requires further thought and investigation. Renal compensation for acid–base disturbances has traditionally been considered to be slower than respiratory compensation. Detailed data on urine output, stage of acute kidney injury, minute ventilation, and other physiologic measures would be required before the relative causal effects of kidney injury in compensating for acidosis could be fully understood. The alactic base excess is not necessarily an explicit measure of renal function. For example, administration of 0.9% sodium chloride decreases the base excess, even in the presence of stable renal function and lactate concentrations. The impact of concurrent liver dysfunction requires consideration, and only a few such cases were included in the ALBIOS database. Nonetheless, the concept of alactic base excess and the role of renal function in modifying acidemia warrant evaluation in future physiologic studies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, more specifically with respect to blood gas analysis, ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having OHS. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of OHS. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of OHS is very unlikely in these patients.

### Infant 4.2% sodium bicarbonate [^c0cd2212]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

### Regulation of blood flow and volume exchange across the microcirculation [^00b7709c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Equation 3: the alveolar gas equationwhere pAO 2 = alveolar partial pressure of oxygen, p amb = ambient air pressure, pH 2 O sat = saturated water vapor pressure, paCO 2 = arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, FiO 2 = fractional oxygen content of inspiratory gas, RQ = respiratory quotient.

Thus, under normal room air steady-state conditions, pAO 2 = ((760 mmHg – 47 mmHg) × 0.21) – (40 mmHg / 0.8) = 100 mmHg

Equation 4: The determinants of oxygen deliverywhere SaO 2 = fractional arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, cHb = hemoglobin concentration of the blood, 1.39 = Hüfner's number (calculated).

Thus, under exemplary steady state conditions in a male adult at rest, DO 2 = 1.0 × 14.5 gHb/dL blood × 1.39 mL O 2 /gHb × 50 dl/min = 1000 mL O 2 /min

It is remarkable that, under steady-state conditions in the human body, globally only around 25% of the delivered oxygen is extracted per unit of time, albeit with high local differences. However, a central venous oxygen saturation of below 70% is a well-established clinical sign that the organism might currently be getting into difficulties.

The products of aerobic glycolysis are CO 2 and water (Eq. 1). CO 2 has to be taken back to the lungs, again with steps of diffusion and convection (plus catalyzed conversion to carbonic acid and dissociation to bicarbonate as intermediates), while the transport of water involves some additional shunting via the lymphatic system and targets other organs besides the lungs. The transport cascade for nutrients and waste products is a comparable one, with the gut, the liver, and the kidneys replacing the lungs. In the following, we will restrict discussion to oxygenation to keep matters as simple as possible, because two things are crystal clear: 1) cells and tissues need O 2 first of all in order to survive; and 2) O 2 can be delivered effectively only by blood flow at the microcirculatory level.

### Extracorporeal gas exchange: when to start and how to end? [^b1c914b2]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Comparative technical difficulty of hemodialysis, extracorporeal removal of carbon dioxide, and extracorporeal oxygenation

Table 1 Reproduced with permission from Gattinoni et al. Control of intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) by extracorporeal removal of carbon dioxide, British Journal of Anesthesia, © 1978 Elsevier Inc.

The CO 2 transfer, due to the physicochemical characteristics of CO 2 in the blood, follows a complete different scheme. The CO 2 content in the blood is primarily function of the strong ion difference: for the same PCO 2, the CO 2 content depends on the difference between expected and actual strong ion difference (i.e. the base excess). As an example, at a base excess of − 10 mEq/L and PCO 2 40 mmHg compared to a base excess of 0 mEq/L at the same PCO 2, the total amount of CO 2 in the blood (dissolved + bicarbonate + carbo-amino compounds) goes from 37 to 50 ml/dL. In normal conditions, with pH close to 7.4 and PCO 2 in the range of 40–50 mmHg, the amount of total CO 2 in the blood is roughly 1 mL per mmHg of CO 2, i.e. with a PCO 2 of 45 mmHg and base excess 0 mEq/L (strong ion difference 42 mEq/L), the CO 2 content is about 45 mL/dL. This means that the near total metabolic production of CO 2 is equivalent to the CO 2 present in about 500 mL of blood. Therefore, if the blood flowing through the membrane lung is ventilated at a very high rate, the total metabolic CO 2 production may be cleared from an amount of blood similar with the one used during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.

Therefore, to provide 200 ml/min of oxygen, high extracorporeal blood flow is required, with minimum ventilation of the artificial lung, while the same amount of CO 2 may be cleared for less than one fourth of the blood flow, but very high ventilation is required. The physiology of the gas exchange with the artificial lung clearly indicates that the oxygenation and CO 2 removal function may be easily dissociated in the artificial extracorporeal system, and this accounts for the tremendous possibility of intervention which is possible using the artificial lung systems.

### Carbon dioxide in the critically ill: too much or too little of a good thing? [^e0e71de5]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercapnia and hypocapnia commonly complicate conditions that are present in critically ill patients. Both conditions have important physiologic effects that may impact the clinical management of these patients. For instance, hypercapnia results in bronchodilation and enhanced hypoxic vasoconstriction, leading to improved ventilation/perfusion matching. Hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood volume through arterial vasoconstriction. These effects have also been exploited for therapeutic aims. In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypocapnia is often utilized to control intracranial pressure. However, this effect is not sustained, and prolonged hypocapnia increases the risk of mortality and severe disability in patients with TBI. Hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis are common consequences of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS. Hypercapnic acidosis reduces ischemic lung injury and preserves lung compliance, but concern has arisen over hypercapnia-induced immunosuppression and the potential for bacterial proliferation in sepsis. Experimental studies suggest that buffering hypercapnic acidosis attenuates these effects, whereas hypocapnia appears to potentiate lung injury through increased capillary permeability and decreased lung compliance. Several areas of uncertainty surround the role of hypercapnia/hypocapnia in treating TBI and ARDS. Current data support recommendations to avoid hypocapnia in treating TBI, with the exception of emergent treatment of elevated intracranial pressure, while awaiting definitive management. Permissive hypercapnia is commonly accepted as a consequence of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS, but there is insufficient evidence to support the induction of hypercapnic acidosis in clinical practice. Buffering hypercapnic acidosis should be considered only for a specific clinical indication (eg, hemodynamic instability). For clinicians choosing to buffer hypercapnic acidosis, tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane is recommended over sodium bicarbonate, as it is more effective in correcting pH and is not associated with increased carbon dioxide production. Future studies should aim to address these areas of uncertainty to help guide clinicians in the therapeutic use and management of hypercapnia/hypocapnia in critically ill patients.

### Predicting arterial blood gas and lactate from central venous blood analysis in critically ill patients: a multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study [^c8ec3b13]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The estimation of arterial blood gas and lactate from central venous blood analysis and pulse oximetry [Formula: see text] readings has not yet been extensively validated.

Methods

In this multicentre, prospective study performed in 590 patients with acute circulatory failure, we measured blood gases and lactate in simultaneous central venous and arterial blood samples at 6 h intervals during the first 24 h after insertion of central venous and arterial catheters. The study population was randomly divided in a 2:1 ratio into model derivation and validation sets. We derived predictive models of arterial pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate, using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood gas values as predictors, and then tested their performance in the validation set.

Results

In the validation set, the agreement intervals between predicted and actual values were -0.078/+0.084 units for arterial pH, -1.32/+1.36 kPa for arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, -5.15/+4.47% for arterial oxygen saturation, and -1.07/+1.05 mmol litre(-1) for arterial lactate (i.e. around two times our predefined clinically tolerable intervals for all variables). This led to ∼5% (or less) of extreme-to-extreme misclassifications, thus giving our predictive models only marginal agreement. Thresholds of predicted variables (as determined from the derivation set) showed high predictive values (consistently > 94%), to exclude abnormal arterial values in the validation set.

Conclusions

Using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood analysis, we predicted arterial blood gas and lactate values with marginal accuracy in patients with circulatory failure. Further studies are required to establish whether the developed models can be used with acceptable safety.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^ad1330df]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^13341778]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

The most common causes of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) are obesity, neuromuscular disease (NMD), chest wall disease (CWD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If left untreated, patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure require frequent hospitalisation and have a high mortality rate. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is particularly common in restrictive ventilatory disorders and also contributes to hypoventilation. OSA can also lead to sleep-related hypoventilation and chronic alveolar hypoventilation (hypercapnic OSA). Hypoventilation first manifests during sleep. Thus, the goal is to treat the sleep-disordered breathing before it progresses to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. In most cases, correction of nocturnal hypercapnia leads to a reset of the respiratory centre and chemosensitivity, restoring ventilation during the day.

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is defined by an arterial CO 2 partial pressure (paCO 2) in the awake state of > 45 mm Hg (6 kPa). It can occur as acute, acute-on-chronic or chronic failure. These types can be distinguished on the basis of the constellation of pH, paCO 2 and bicarbonate concentration (cHCO 3-) in the arterial blood gas analysis if no additional metabolic acidosis or alkalosis is present. Metabolic compensation of respiratory acidosis occurs over a period of hours to days. The kidneys respond to respiratory acidosis during sleep by increasing bicarbonate, which may remain elevated during wakefulness. Thus, elevated bicarbonate, especially after waking, can occur as a result of sleep hypoventilation before the onset of daytime hypercapnia. It is therefore used as a screening tool for early diagnosis of sleep hypoventilation in patients at risk of developing chronic hypercapnic ventilatory failure, such as those with obesity, NMD and CWD. A bicarbonate level of 24 ± 2 mmol/L is considered normal. The bicarbonate value is either calculated using acid-base formulas or measured directly in the serum. It has been suggested that a serum bicarbonate concentration of > 27 mmol/L could be used as an indicator of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and should prompt to measure arterial blood gases. An elevated bicarbonate is also used as one of the indicators of residual hypoventilation under HMV.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^c457ea7e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Prior studies confirm that v-TAC shows close agreement with ABG for pH and PCO 2 at all ranges, though its clinical application is not established. The v-TAC method also shows close agreement with ABG for PO 2 up to 10 kPa, though not for higher oxygen levels. This is because of the nature of the oxygen dissociation curve. The commercial version of the software, therefore, reports PO 2 up to 10 kPa. The primary aim of our study was to compare ABG sampling against VBG, v-TAC and CBG sampling in the longitudinal assessment of inpatients with suspected hypercapnic respiratory failure and considered for treatment with NIV.

While ABG sampling is the recognised gold standard, our study data also provided a means to explore this further as a secondary aim. There is emerging evidence that intermittent ABG sampling can lack precision due to transient changes in the breathing pattern of the patient. A recent study of invasively ventilated adult subjects showed that arterial blood pH and CO 2 values change rapidly in response to a transient increase (+100%) or decrease (−60%) in ventilation, whereas peripheral venous samples change little in the first 60 s. It is well recognised that the anticipatory fear of pain just before an ABG can cause hyperventilation or breath-holding. Data are lacking on the prevalence or impact. It was postulated recently that the v-TAC conversion from venous blood could mitigate the acute changes in the arterial baseline induced by a transient change in breathing pattern. We, therefore, conducted a post hoc analysis of our data set to consider the potential effect of transient changes in breathing pattern.

### Respiratory acidosis [^ddc37ac7]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis, or primary hypercapnia, is the acid-base disorder that results from an increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Acute respiratory acidosis occurs with acute (Type II) respiratory failure, which can result from any sudden respiratory parenchymal (eg, pulmonary edema), airways (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), pleural, chest wall, neuromuscular (eg, spinal cord injury), or central nervous system event (eg, drug overdose). Chronic respiratory acidosis can result from numerous processes and is typified by a sustained increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, resulting in renal adaptation, and a more marked increase in plasma bicarbonate. Mechanisms of respiratory acidosis include increased carbon dioxide production, alveolar hypoventilation, abnormal respiratory drive, abnormalities of the chest wall and respiratory muscles, and increased dead space. Although the symptoms, signs, and physiologic consequences of respiratory acidosis are numerous, the principal effects are on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Treatment for respiratory acidosis may include invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support and specific medical therapies directed at the underlying pathophysiology.

### Prospective correlation of arterial vs venous blood gas measurements in trauma patients [^a59abae8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to assess if venous blood gas (VBG) results (pH and base excess [BE]) are numerically similar to arterial blood gas (ABG) in acutely ill trauma patients.

Methods

We prospectively correlated paired ABG and VBG results (pH and BE) in adult trauma patients when ABG was clinically indicated. A priori consensus threshold of clinical equivalence was set at ± less than 0.05 pH units and ± less than 2 BE units. We hypothesized that ABG results could be predicted by VBG results using a regression equation, derived from 173 patients, and validated on 173 separate patients.

Results

We analyzed 346 patients and found mean arterial pH of 7.39 and mean venous pH of 7.35 in the derivation set. Seventy-two percent of the paired sample pH values fell within the predefined consensus equivalence threshold of ± less than 0.05 pH units, whereas the 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) were twice as wide, at -0.10 to 0.11 pH units. Mean arterial BE was -2.2 and venous BE was -1.9. Eighty percent of the paired BE values fell within the predefined ± less than 2 BE units, whereas the 95% LOA were again more than twice as wide, at -4.4 to 3.9 BE units. Correlations between ABG and VBG were strong, at r(2) = 0.70 for pH and 0.75 for BE.

Conclusion

Although VBG results do correlate well with ABG results, only 72% to 80% of paired samples are clinically equivalent, and the 95% LOAs are unacceptably wide. Therefore, ABG samples should be obtained in acutely ill trauma patients if accurate acid-base status is required.

Capillary blood gas sampling (CBGS) — indications in neonatal and pediatric patients are that it is indicated when arterial blood gas analysis is indicated but arterial access is not available, when noninvasive monitor readings are abnormal (transcutaneous values, end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry), when assessment of initiation, administration, or change in therapeutic modalities (ie, mechanical ventilation) is indicated, when a change in patient status is detected by history or physical assessment, and when monitoring the severity and progression of a documented disease process is desirable.

Figure 2 shows Bland-Altman agreements for ABG against VBG, v-TAC and CBG and compares changes in PCO 2 pre-NIV and post-NIV. ABG and v-TAC values showed close agreement for PCO 2 and pH values. Mean bias for v-TAC against ABG was 0.01 kPa (SD 0.50 kPa), whereas it was −1.00 (0.90) kPa for VBG and +0.75 (0.69) kPa for CBG. For pH, the bias vs ABG was −0.002 (0.027) for v-TAC, 0.033 (0.035) for VBG and −0.039 (0.035) for CBG (a negative value for mean difference indicates that the arterial value is lower than the comparator).

### Compulsory hyperventilation and hypocapnia of patients with Leigh syndrome associated with SURF1 gene mutations as a cause of low serum bicarbonates [^d7b00669]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Experimental data show that elevation of intracellular pH leads to severe lesions of brain cells. Acidification of intracellular fluid by accumulation of lactate may compensate the effect of respiratory alkalosis. Increased serum pH, and low PCO2, associated with hyperlactataemia (sometimes incorrectly called 'acidosis') have been reported in children with Leigh syndrome (LS). The aim of the study was to determine whether respiratory alkalosis is characteristic of patients with LS due to SURF1 mutations. All venous blood gas data (88 samples) of 18 spontaneously breathing LS patients with recently established SURF1 mutations, hospitalized during 1986–2000, were retrospectively reviewed. The data of an affected boy who survived on a respirator for more than 3 months (79 daily samples) were analysed separately. In spontaneously breathing patients, the data indicated that the patients had compensated or partially compensated respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.388 ± 0.060, Pco2 29.2 ± 5.7 mmHg, HCO3- 17.4 ± 3.0 mmol/L, BE -6.7 ± 3.2 mmol/L). Bicarbonate excretion was detected in urine of two examined LS cases in spite of decreased serum HCO3-. In the affected child maintained on a respirator, simple manipulation of the inspired CO2 tension to establish a normal pressure of 35–45 mmHg automatically caused an increase of serum HCO3- concentration to a normal value of 26.3 ± 2.9 mmol/L (and BE to +2.2 ± 3.1 mmol/L), in spite of cytochrome oxidase (COX) deficiency due to a confirmed SURF1 mutation. We suggest that respiratory alkalosis (hypocapnia) of Leigh syndrome patients with SURF1 mutations results from compulsory hyperventilation and speculate that hypocapnia may contribute to Leigh-like brain damage in the SURF1-deficient patients as well as in other patients presenting with Leigh-like syndrome. The supposition that accumulation of lactate may protect the brain of LS patients from alkalosis-related damage requires further study. Avoidance of any factors stimulating hyperventilation of LS patients and caution when attempting to correct low plasma bicarbonate are suggested.

Derived

Actual HCO 3: the actual amount of bicarbonate contained in a sample. Plasma is equilibrated with partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg) at 20°C and actual HCO 3 − calculated from the volume of CO 2 evolved when acid (HCl) is added to the sample.
Standard HCO 3 −: this is the concentration of bicarbonate when the sample is equilibrated with PCO 2 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg) at 37°C, and with Hb fully saturated with O 2. The effects of respiratory acidosis/alkalosis are eliminated.
Base excess: the quantity of strong acid (or base) required to titrate 1 L of blood back to pH 7.4 at PCO 2 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg) and 37°C.
FiO 2: the fraction of oxygen in inspired gas especially that supplied as supplemental oxygen via a mask or nasal cannula. The alveolar gas equation can be used to predict the greatest partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli (PAO 2) that can be achieved for a given FiO 2. In normal, the difference between PAO 2 and PaO 2 is usually small (< 1 kPa/7 mm Hg). The FiO 2 must be known to assess the adequacy of oxygenation.

The alveolar gas equation: assuming barometric pressure (P B) = 101 kPa; saturated water vapour pressure (P H20) at 37°C = 6.3 kPa; alveolar CO 2 (PACO 2) = 5.2 kPa; respiratory quotient (RQ) = 0.8.

SaO 2: the percentage of haemoglobin saturated with oxygen (oxyhaemoglobin), that is, oxygen saturation.

Acid-base balance

Acid-base balance is tightly regulated by the respiratory system and renal system to maintain a pH between 7.36 and 7.42. The relationship between P a CO 2 /acid [H +] and bicarbonate/base [HCO 3] is shown in figure 17.

Physiological aspects of CO 2 production and transport

Under aerobic conditions, CO 2 is produced at the mitochondrial level as a by-product of substrate oxidation (pyruvate and citric acid cycle intermediates) (Fig. 1). The relationship between the amount of oxygen consumed (VO 2) and CO 2 produced (VCO 2) during aerobic metabolism is termed the respiratory quotient (RQ = VCO 2 /VO 2), and differs according to the main type of oxidized substrate (glucose, RQ = 1; proteins, RQ = 0.8; lipids, RQ = 0.7). Under anaerobic conditions, protons (H +) resulting from lactic acid production and ATP hydrolysis may generate CO 2 following buffering by bicarbonates (HCO 3 −), leading to the formation of so-called "anaerobic CO 2 ". Once formed, CO 2 diffuses within the surrounding environment and capillary blood, to be transported to the lungs for elimination. In blood, CO 2 transport is partitioned into three distinct fractions:
Dissolved CO 2 fraction, which is in equilibrium with the partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2), according to Henry's law of gas solubility: V gas = S gas × (P gas /P atm), where V gas is the volume of dissolved gas (in ml/ml), S gas is the Henry's constant of gas solubility (0.52 ml/ml for CO 2 at 37 °C), and P atm the atmospheric pressure. Thus, in arterial blood with a PaCO 2 of 40 mmHg (at sea level, 37 °C), dissolved CO 2 = [0.52 × (40/760)] = 27 ml/l, which is about 5% of the total CO 2 (note that, in mmol/l, Henry's constant for CO 2 = 0.03 mmol/l/mmHg; also note that the conversion factor from mmol to mL CO 2 is ~ 22.3).
Bicarbonate (HCO 3 −). CO 2 in blood readily diffuses within red blood cells (RBCs), where it combines with H 2 O to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3), a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. In turn, H 2 CO 3 dissociates to form HCO 3 − and H +. While H + is buffered by hemoglobin (formation of HbH), HCO 3 − exits the RBC in exchange for a chloride anion (Cl −) via a HCO 3 − -Cl − transporter (erythrocyte chloride shift or Hamburger effect). Thus, the HCO 3 − concentration increases in venous blood whereas the Cl − concentration diminishes. CO 2 transport as HCO 3 − (RBC and plasma fraction) represents about 90% of the total CO 2 content in arterial blood (this proportion is lower in venous blood due to the Haldane effect). Taking into account a normal hematocrit of 0.45, the CO 2 content under the form of HCO 3 − (in whole blood) is ~ 435 ml/l.
Formation of carbamino compounds within hemoglobin: part of the CO 2 within the RBC combines with free amino (R-NH 2) groups within hemoglobin to form carbamino-hemoglobin (R-NH 2 -CO 2). This reaction is enhanced when hemoglobin carries less oxygen, implying that more CO 2 is transported as (R-NH 2 -CO 2) when the PO 2 decreases, which is the basis of the Haldane effect described below. CO 2 transport under the form of (R-NH 2 -CO 2) represents about 5% of the total CO 2 content in arterial blood (~ 1.1 mmol/L ≈ 25 ml/l).

### Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis: report of two cases [^8f26a0a5]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Two children who presented with symptomatic metabolic acidosis after being put on topiramate (TPM) are reported. The first patient was an 11-year-old male with refractory complex partial epilepsy who was put on TPM for 13 months. He developed hyperventilation 1 week after increasing the dose to 300 mg/day. Arterial blood gas revealed hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis with partial respiratory compensation: pH 7.36, PCO2 27.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 14.9 mEq/L, base excess -8.9 mmol/L. Hyperventilation and acidosis resolved after administration of sodium bicarbonate and reduction of the dose of TPM. The second patient was a female who developed increasing irritability at age 16 months and 21 months, each time associated with introduction of TPM and resolved promptly upon withdrawal of the drug. Venous blood gas taken during the second episode revealed pH 7.34, PCO2 37.4 mmHg, bicarbonate 20.4 mEq/L, base excess -4.2 mmol/L. The predominant mechanism of TPM-induced hyperventilation involves inhibition of carbonic anhydrase at the proximal renal tubule, resulting in impaired proximal bicarbonate reabsorption. The occurrence of hyperpnoea or mental status change in any patient who is on TPM should prompt an urgent blood gas sampling, with correction of the acid-base disturbances accordingly.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^32549c77]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^66c55ce2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids, The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^904bce83]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Background

Accurate arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is essential in the management of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, but repeated sampling requires technical expertise and is painful. Missed sampling is common and has a negative impact on patient care. A newer venous to arterial conversion method (v-TAC, Roche) uses mathematical models of acid–base chemistry, a venous blood gas sample and peripheral blood oxygen saturation to calculate arterial acid–base status. It has the potential to replace routine ABG sampling for selected patient cohorts. The aim of this study was to compare v-TAC with ABG, capillary and venous sampling in a patient cohort referred to start non-invasive ventilation (NIV).

Methods

Recruited patients underwent near simultaneous ABG, capillary blood gas (CBG) and venous blood gas (VBG) sampling at day 0, and up to two further occasions (day 1 NIV and discharge). The primary outcome was the reliability of v-TAC sampling compared with ABG, via Bland-Altman analysis, to identify respiratory failure (via PaCO 2) and to detect changes in PaCO 2 in response to NIV. Secondary outcomes included agreements with pH, sampling success rates and pain.

Results

The agreement between ABG and v-TAC/venous PaCO 2 was assessed for 119 matched sampling episodes and 105 between ABG and CBG. Close agreement was shown for v-TAC (mean difference (SD) 0.01 (0.5) kPa), but not for CBG (−0.75 (0.69) kPa) or VBG (+1.00 (0.90) kPa). Longitudinal data for 32 patients started on NIV showed the closest agreement for ABG and v-TAC (R 2 = 0.61). v-TAC sampling had the highest first-time success rate (88%) and was less painful than arterial (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Mathematical arterialisation of venous samples was easier to obtain and less painful than ABG sampling. Results showed close agreement for PaCO2 and pH and tracked well longitudinally such that the v-TAC method could replace routine ABG testing to recognise and monitor patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^572ba2ce]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

11.3. Respiratory management after cardiac surgery — supportive measures emphasize that respiratory management plays a critical role in the management of PH and avoidance of PHCs, maintaining adequate lung volumes and gas exchange while avoiding acidosis during the postoperative period is crucial for successful outcomes, high doses of fentanyl attenuate the stress response in neonates and continuous fentanyl infusion with the use of muscle relaxants is recommended during the early postoperative period, supplemental doses of fentanyl immediately before endotracheal suctioning are often used to attenuate the risk for PHCs, brief hyperventilation or sodium bicarbonate infusions are useful for the immediate management of PHC, but prolonged alkalosis may have adverse effects and sodium bicarbonate can also decrease cardiac output and cerebral blood flow and increase central venous pressure and SVR.

### Simple, easily memorised "rules of thumb" for the rapid assessment of physiological compensation for respiratory acid-base disorders [^0480ab7d]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter" for home oxygen, metabolic acidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, tuberous sclerosis complex, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Fournier's gangrene, colonic volvulus, foreign body ingestion, botulism, status epilepticus, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetic ketoacidosis, near-drowning, inhalation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiac arrest, sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, influenza virus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, COVID-19 infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia and blood gas analysis.

The Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Interpreter analyzes arterial blood gas results, including pH, PaCO₂, and HCO₃⁻, to assess acid-base status, oxygenation, and ventilation. It aids in diagnosing respiratory, metabolic, and mixed acid-base disorders, guiding clinical management in acute and chronic conditions.

The Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter analyzes three key parameters: arterial pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) levels to assess acid-base balance in the body. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parameters**
- **Arterial pH**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. A normal range is between 7.35 and 7.45.
- **PaCO₂**: The pressure exerted by carbon dioxide in the blood, typically between 35–45 mmHg. If measured in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.5.
- **HCO₃⁻**: The concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, with a normal level around 24 mmol/L.

2. **Determine Acid-Base Status**
- If pH is normal (7.35–7.45), the status is "Normal".
- If pH is less than 7.35, "Acidosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ > 45, it suggests "Respiratory Acidosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≤ 45, it suggests "Metabolic Acidosis".
- If pH is greater than 7.45, "Alkalosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ < 35, it suggests "Respiratory Alkalosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≥ 35, it suggests "Metabolic Alkalosis".

3. **Calculate Expected Values for Compensation**
- For "Respiratory Acidosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 + (PaCO₂ - 40) / 10.
- For "Respiratory Alkalosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 - (40 - PaCO₂) / 5.
- For "Metabolic Acidosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 - (24 - HCO₃⁻) × 1.2.
- For "Metabolic Alkalosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 + (HCO₃⁻ - 24) × 0.7.

4. **Determine Compensation Level**
- "Uncompensated" indicates no significant correctional changes.
- "Partially Compensated" is considered if deviation from expected values is moderate (≤ 5 units).
- "Fully Compensated" is concluded with minimal deviation (≤ 2 units) from expected values.

5. **Interpretation and Breakdown**
- The analysis concludes with indicating if there's an acidosis or alkalosis, its type, and compensation level.
- Interpretation provides insights, suggesting chronic conditions if compensation is partial or full.
- A breakdown of calculations includes expected vs. actual values for HCO₃⁻ and PaCO₂.

This interpretation aids healthcare providers in understanding whether the body's compensatory mechanisms are effectively mitigating the imbalance, helping diagnose underlying conditions like respiratory or metabolic dysfunctions.

### Evaluation and treatment of respiratory alkalosis [^1a966816]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is the most frequent acid-base disturbance encountered in clinical practice. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, for whom the degree of hypocapnia directly correlates with adverse outcomes. Although this acid-base disturbance often is considered benign, evidence suggests that the alkalemia of primary hypocapnia can cause clinically significant decreases in tissue oxygen delivery. Mild respiratory alkalosis often serves as a marker of an underlying disease and may not require therapeutic intervention. In contrast, severe respiratory alkalosis should be approached with a sense of urgency and be aggressively corrected.
