## Question

50 year old female with normal renal function and poor dental hygiene, diagnosed with native valve endocarditis. What pathogens should I target for empiric therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathogens to target for empiric antimicrobial therapy for a 50-year-old woman with native valve infective endocarditis, poor dental hygiene, and normal renal function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how poor dental hygiene shifts the likely microbiology. Then, I should verify the most common pathogens in native valve endocarditis and how they map to empiric coverage. Next, I will review guideline-based empiric regimens for acute versus subacute presentations and for culture-negative scenarios. After that, I need to check dosing, pharmacokinetic targets, and renal considerations. Finally, I will outline what to avoid, how to monitor, and how to de-escalate once cultures return, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting recommendations along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Poor dental hygiene increases the frequency and magnitude of viridans group streptococcal bacteremia from routine activities like chewing and toothbrushing, which elevates the risk of native valve endocarditis; this aligns with historical and contemporary observations linking oral streptococci to community-acquired native valve disease, especially outside injection drug use settings [^116Z7G5t] [^114rJxHb]. I should also remember that contemporary epidemiology shows Staphylococcus aureus is now the most common cause of IE in many regions, so I must not underweight staphylococcal coverage in empiric therapy even when oral streptococci are plausible [^113U7dtB] [^114w4TzS].

> Next, I should review the likely pathogens to target empirically. For native valve IE in a community-acquired patient with poor oral hygiene, the predominant organisms are viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus species (particularly E. faecalis), and Staphylococcus aureus, with HACEK organisms as less frequent but important considerations, especially in subacute presentations; this distribution guides empiric choices pending culture results [^112phP1u] [^114B2Hu4] [^116RceJj]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overemphasizing HACEK in an acute presentation; guidelines suggest HACEK coverage is more critical in subacute cases, which tempers how aggressively I broaden early on [^116YUa4r].

> I will now examine empiric regimens for an acute presentation. For acute native valve IE, vancomycin plus cefepime is a reasonable initial regimen to cover MRSA/MSSA, enterococci, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including HACEK, until susceptibilities are known; this aligns with AHA guidance for acute presentations and supports early broad coverage in unstable patients [^115RrA9g] [^112phP1u]. Wait, let me verify the gram-negative component; cefepime provides reliable HACEK coverage and is favored over ampicillin-sulbactam in acute regimens where broader gram-negative activity is desired, which fits this scenario [^115RrA9g].

> For a subacute presentation, I should confirm that vancomycin plus ampicillin-sulbactam is a reasonable empiric choice. This combination targets MRSA/MSSA, enterococci, and HACEK while leveraging ampicillin-sulbactam's activity against many oral streptococci and enterococci; AHA supports this approach for subacute native valve presentations pending culture data [^115RrA9g] [^112phP1u]. Hold on, I should verify that this pairing also covers viridans streptococci adequately; yes, ampicillin provides excellent streptococcal coverage, and the sulbactam component adds useful activity in polymicrobial contexts, though it is not active against enterococci, so vancomycin remains necessary for enterococcal coverage until MICs are known [^notfound].

> But wait, what if cultures are negative before antibiotics are started? I need to ensure I distinguish pre-treated from true culture-negative endocarditis. If antibiotics were given before cultures, empiric therapy should prioritize methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci; if no prior antibiotics, consider fastidious organisms like Bartonella, Coxiella, or Tropheryma and tailor accordingly, ideally with ID consultation and advanced diagnostics such as serology or valve PCR when available [^113mMcFr] [^116t8dqV]. I should double-check that this distinction is emphasized in recent statements; yes, contemporary AHA BCNE guidance explicitly separates these scenarios and recommends regimen adjustments based on prior antibiotic exposure and epidemiology [^113mMcFr].

> Now, dosing and pharmacokinetic targets. For vancomycin, I initially thought to target a trough of 10–15 μg/mL, but wait, I should verify current practice; for serious infections including IE, many experts favor AUC-guided dosing with a target AUC/MIC of 400–600, and if troughs are used, 10–20 μg/mL is acceptable, with careful monitoring to avoid nephrotoxicity, especially when combined with other nephrotoxins [^112emJsN]. For cefepime, 2 g IV every 8–12 hours provides robust gram-negative and HACEK coverage in this setting, and for ampicillin-sulbactam, 3 g IV every 6 hours is standard for empiric therapy in IE, with adjustments as susceptibilities return [^115RrA9g] [^112emJsN]. I need to ensure renal function is monitored closely even when baseline is normal, given the nephrotoxic potential of vancomycin and frequent coadministration of aminoglycosides in some regimens [^114EV8Nd].

> Next, I should review what to avoid empirically. Gentamicin should not be added for staphylococcal native valve IE because it does not improve outcomes and increases nephrotoxicity risk; this applies to both MRSA and MSSA, and is a consistent theme across AHA and IDSA guidance [^111gNq1Z] [^1132qjza] [^114EV8Nd]. I also need to ensure I do not add rifampin for native valve staphylococcal IE; rifampin is reserved for prosthetic valve disease or specific scenarios and is not recommended routinely for native valve disease [^11448jEv]. Clindamycin should be avoided for staphylococcal IE due to relapse concerns, reinforcing the preference for beta-lactams or vancomycin/daptomycin when appropriate [^116CxDok].

> I should confirm duration principles and how to count therapy days. Therapy should be prolonged and bactericidal, typically 4–6 weeks for most pathogens, and the day count generally begins when blood cultures are negative and appropriate therapy is in place; repeating blood cultures every 24–48 hours until clearance is reasonable, and ID consultation at initiation is advised to optimize regimen selection and stewardship [^114v2mc3] [^115HgmMD]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with major guidelines; yes, both AHA and ESC endorse prolonged parenteral therapy with culture-guided de-escalation and early ID involvement [^115HgmMD].

> Once cultures return, I need to tailor therapy precisely. For viridans streptococci or S. gallolyticus with MIC ≤ 0.12 μg/mL, penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4 weeks is standard, with a 2-week penicillin/ceftriaxone plus gentamicin option in select uncomplicated cases with normal renal function; vancomycin is an alternative for beta-lactam intolerance, with attention to trough or AUC targets [^1123Qu1b] [^114LqVaW]. For MSSA, nafcillin or oxacillin for 6 weeks is preferred; vancomycin is reserved for beta-lactam intolerance or MRSA, and daptomycin is a reasonable alternative in selected cases with ID input; again, avoid gentamicin in native valve staphylococcal IE [^112VixYi] [^115D47dT] [^111gNq1Z]. For enterococci, ampicillin plus gentamicin for 4–6 weeks depending on symptom duration is standard, with a double beta-lactam regimen (ampicillin plus ceftriaxone) as an alternative when aminoglycoside resistance or toxicity is a concern, and vancomycin-based regimens reserved for specific resistance patterns or intolerance [^1158WWn5] [^114QwYYb] [^111dUa6A].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive measures are addressed. Early dental evaluation and source control are essential, and the patient should receive education on meticulous oral hygiene and regular dental care to reduce recurrent bacteremia risk; this is emphasized in both dental and cardiology guidance and is particularly relevant given her poor baseline oral hygiene [^113MzTbv] [^116Z7G5t]. I should also confirm plans for monitoring complications with serial exams and targeted imaging when indicated, and arrange follow-up to document culture clearance and clinical response before finalizing duration decisions [^112dADnG] [^115HgmMD].

Empiric therapy for a 50-year-old woman with native valve endocarditis and poor dental hygiene should target **viridans streptococci, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus** as the most likely pathogens [^112phP1u] [^116RceJj]. AHA/ESC-recommended regimens include **vancomycin plus ceftriaxone** [^115RrA9g] or **ampicillin plus ceftriaxone with gentamicin** [^notfound] to cover these organisms, with adjustments for β-lactam allergy or local resistance patterns [^115jqwHS]. Start empiric therapy after obtaining at least three sets of blood cultures, then tailor to culture and susceptibility results [^1157Q1H9] [^115HgmMD].

## Likely pathogens and empiric coverage

Poor dental hygiene increases the risk of **viridans streptococci** and other oral flora; empiric therapy should therefore cover these organisms [^116Z7G5t].

| **Pathogen** | **Empiric coverage** |
|-|-|
| Viridans streptococci | Penicillin G, ceftriaxone, or vancomycin [^1123Qu1b] [^114LqVaW] |
| Enterococcus spp | Ampicillin or vancomycin plus gentamicin [^114QwYYb] [^112emJsN] |
| Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA) | Vancomycin or daptomycin [^113s42sh] [^115D47dT] |
| HACEK organisms | Ceftriaxone [^116vLdok] |

---

## Recommended empiric regimens

Recommended empiric regimens include:

- **Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone**: Covers viridans streptococci, Enterococcus spp., and S. aureus; suitable for penicillin-allergic patients [^113mMcFr].
- **Ampicillin plus ceftriaxone with gentamicin**: Covers viridans streptococci, Enterococcus spp., and HACEK organisms; suitable for non-penicillin-allergic patients [^114AVtsg] [^116vLdok].
- **Vancomycin plus gentamicin**: Alternative for severe β-lactam allergy [^115jqwHS] [^112emJsN].

---

## Dosing and administration

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Administration** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 30 mg/kg/day IV | - Two divided doses <br/> - Adjust to trough 10–20 µg/mL [^112emJsN] |
| Ceftriaxone | 2 g IV every 12 hours | Once-daily dosing [^1123Qu1b] |
| Ampicillin | 12 g/day IV | Four to six divided doses [^114AVtsg] |
| Gentamicin | 3 mg/kg/day IV | - Once-daily dosing <br/> - Monitor levels [^1123Qu1b] |

---

## Duration of empiric therapy

Empiric therapy should continue until **culture and susceptibility results are available**, typically 48–72 hours, then transition to targeted therapy based on identified pathogens and sensitivities [^115HgmMD].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Renal function**: Normal renal function allows standard dosing; monitor for nephrotoxicity, especially with vancomycin and gentamicin [^113ysYK6].
- **Allergy history**: Adjust regimen if β-lactam allergy is present [^115jqwHS].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Consider local epidemiology and resistance data when selecting empiric therapy [^116YUa4r].

---

Empiric therapy for a 50-year-old woman with native valve endocarditis and poor dental hygiene should cover **viridans streptococci, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus** [^113ysYK6]. Recommended regimens include vancomycin plus ceftriaxone or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone with gentamicin, with adjustments for allergy or resistance. Therapy should be individualized based on culture results, renal function, and patient-specific factors [^115HgmMD].

### Infectious endocarditis: diagnosis and treatment [^114B2Hu4]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious endocarditis results from bacterial or fungal infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include the presence of a prosthetic heart valve, structural or congenital heart disease, intravenous drug use, and a recent history of invasive procedures. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with unexplained fevers, night sweats, or signs of systemic illness. Diagnosis is made using the Duke criteria, which include clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings. Antibiotic treatment of infectious endocarditis depends on whether the involved valve is native or prosthetic, as well as the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. Common blood culture isolates include Staphylococcus aureus, viridans Streptococcus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Valvular structural and functional integrity may be adversely affected in infectious endocarditis, and surgical consultation is warranted in patients with aggressive or persistent infections, emboli, and valvular compromise or rupture. After completion of antibiotic therapy, patients should be educated about the importance of daily dental hygiene, regular visits to the dentist, and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis before certain procedures.

Enterococcus endocarditis — aminoglycoside use and dosing: Approximately 97% of cases of enterococcal IE are caused by E faecalis, and in older, comorbid patients gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity may complicate a "standard" 4- to 6-week course; in some situations the potential risk of attempting to complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy may exceed the benefit. Human studies used dosing intervals ranging from once daily to 3 times daily, and the data were insufficient to compare the efficacy of once-daily with divided doses; until more convincing data demonstrate once-daily dosing is as effective, in patients with normal renal function, gentamicin should be administered in daily multiple divided doses (total, ≈3 mg·kg−1·d−1). In patients with normal renal function, it is reasonable to administer gentamicin every 8 hours with the dose adjusted to achieve a 1-hour serum concentration of ≈3 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL; increasing the dose did not enhance efficacy but did increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^1129GUes]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 3–10 cases per 100 000 per year. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, prognosis remains poor, as reflected by hospital mortality of about 22%, rising to 40% at 5 years. Morbidity rates are also high; 50% of patients require operative management in the acute phase of the disease, often with ongoing consequences for quality of life. The substantial risk associated with IE has driven recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups, particularly those with valvular heart disease and other structural cardiac disorders.

Ever since the 1950s when the large-scale commercial production of penicillin was established, the American Heart Association (AHA) has advocated antibiotic prophylaxis in subgroups of patients undergoing invasive procedures, including dental extraction and certain gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures, that are likely to cause secondary bacteraemia. Secondary bacteraemia in relation to these procedures is well documented but a causal relationship with IE has never been established in randomised trials or case–control studies. Despite this, antibiotic prophylaxis has remained a central component of management in at-risk individuals for over 50 years.

In 2002, innovative guidelines in France challenged accepted practice by suggesting restriction of prophylaxis against IE to patients with the highest ratio of benefit to individual and collective risk while emphasising the importance of general and oral hygiene in populations at risk. In 2007, the AHA — followed in 2009 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) — withdrew recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in all but the highest risk individuals such as those with previous IE, prosthetic heart valves or immunodeficiency disorders. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made the yet more radical recommendation for complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in all individuals regardless of risk. These new guideline recommendations, summarised in table 1, broke with a long-established principle of care and caused deep concern among many clinicians who cited historical, often small studies in questioning whether the recommendation was evidence based and whether it was safe for patients.NICE was unrepentant arguing that the absence of an evidence base was precisely why the need for antibiotic prophylaxis had been questioned and that the harms of anaphylaxis through wide-scale application of antibiotic prophylaxis were likely to exceed any potential benefits of IE prevention.

Native valve infective endocarditis due to highly penicillin‑susceptible viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) (MIC ≤ 0.12 μg/mL) — efficacy and regimen selection: Bacteriological cure rates ≥ 98% may be anticipated with 4 weeks of parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone; in selected patients, a 2‑week regimen of penicillin or ceftriaxone plus an aminoglycoside resulted in cure rates similar to 4 weeks of monotherapy, and studies showed once‑daily ceftriaxone with netilmicin or gentamicin administered once daily was equivalent in efficacy to 2 weeks of penicillin with an aminoglycoside administered in daily divided doses. The 2‑week regimen of penicillin or ceftriaxone combined with single daily‑dose gentamicin is reasonable in uncomplicated cases and is not recommended for patients with known extracardiac infection or those with a creatinine clearance of < 20 mL/min. For patients unable to tolerate penicillin or ceftriaxone, vancomycin is a reasonably effective alternative; the likelihood of "red man" syndrome is reduced with an infusion of vancomycin over 1 hour, and desired trough vancomycin levels should range between 10 and 15 μg/mL.

Care during and after completion of antimicrobial treatment in infective endocarditis — follow-up and testing are outlined as follows: Echocardiography is reasonable before or synchronous with completion of antimicrobial therapy to establish a new baseline, and patients should be educated about the signs of endocarditis; routine blood cultures are no longer recommended after completion of antimicrobial therapy because the likelihood of a positive culture result without evidence of active infection is low. In the short-term follow-up, relapse of IE is a primary concern, and new onset of fever, chills, or other evidence of systemic toxicity mandates immediate evaluation with a thorough history and physical examination and ≥ 3 sets of blood cultures; every effort should be made to determine the cause of signs or symptoms of infection, empirical antimicrobial therapy should be avoided for an undefined febrile illness unless the clinical condition warrants, and it is reasonable for patients who have completed therapy to undergo an examination after completing antibiotic therapy. Table 18 lists actions including 'At least 3 sets of blood cultures from separate sites for any febrile illness and before initiation of antibiotic therapy', 'Prompt removal of intravenous catheter at completion of antimicrobial therapy', and long-term measures such as 'Evaluation of valvular and ventricular function (echocardiography)' and 'Scrupulous oral hygiene and frequent dental professional office visits', along with 'Thorough dental evaluation and treatment if not performed earlier in evaluation', 'Education on the signs of endocarditis and need for antibiotic prophylaxis for certain dental/surgical/invasive procedures', and 'Drug rehabilitation referral for patients who use illicit injection drugs'.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — historical rationale and current emphasis — Viridans group streptococci are noted to cause at least 50 per cent of community-acquired native valve IE not associated with intravenous drug use, and early work reported bacteremia related to oral hygiene and dental extraction. Okell and Elliott in 1935 reported that 11 percent of patients with poor oral hygiene had positive blood cultures with viridans group streptococci, and that 61 percent of patients had viridans group streptococcal bacteremia with dental extraction. As a result of these early and subsequent studies, during the past 50 years the AHA guidelines recommended antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients with underlying cardiac conditions who underwent bacteremia-producing procedures, yet most of these factors remain valid, but collectively they do not compensate for the lack of published data that demonstrate a benefit from prophylaxis. The large majority of published studies have focused on dental procedures as a cause of IE and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent IE in patients at risk, and few data exist on the risk of or prevention of IE associated with a GI or GU tract procedure; accordingly, the Committee undertook a critical analysis of published data in the context of the historical rationale for recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for IE before a dental procedure. Available evidence supports an emphasis on maintaining good oral hygiene and eradicating dental disease to decrease the frequency of bacteremia from routine daily activities.

Empirical antibiotic treatment options for blood culture–negative endocarditis: literature‐based recommendations.*,

AUC₂₄/MIC indicates area under the serum concentration versus time curve for 0 to 24 hours/minimum inhibitory concentration; BCNE, blood culture–negative endocarditis; HCA‐IE, health care–associated infective endocarditis; NVE, native valve endocarditis; and PVE, prosthetic valve endocarditis. *A clear distinction must be made between BCNE in patients who received antibiotics before blood cultures were sampled, when empirical treatment should primarily target methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, and BCNE in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, where empirical treatment active on fastidious organisms such as Bartonella spp, Coxiella burnetii, and Tropheryma whipplei may be warranted. Current recommendations are only based on expert opinion and clinical practice. † USA‐based regimens per the 2015 AHA scientific statement "Infective Endocarditis in Adults: Diagnosis, Antimicrobial Therapy, and Management of Complications". Some members of the writing group use a combination of vancomycin and ceftriaxone only to treat NVE. ‡ European‐based regimens per the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of endocarditis. In France, amoxicillin plus cefazolin is the preferred empirical treatment for acutely ill patients with community‐acquired native valve or late prosthetic valve IE, because it allows optimal coverage of the 3 major pathogens in this setting: cefazolin for methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, amoxicillin for penicillin‐susceptible streptococci, and the synergistic effect of both for Enterococcus faecalis. § The writing group favors adding rifampin once source control is attained. Some writing group members include rifampin in late PVE. ‖ Gentamicin is often avoided by writing group members due to risk of toxicity and side effects.

After molecular, serologic, or pathologic test results identify a specific pathogen, empiric antimicrobial therapy can be subsequently tailored in accordance with pathogen‐specific treatment, always in consultation with an infectious diseases expert to assist with interpretation of test results and to guide treatment decisions.

In selected BCNE cases where the confirmed causative pathogen is either methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci, transitioning to highly bioavailable oral therapy may be considered in patients who are stable and meet the POET (Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis) trial criteria.

Infectious diseases specialist

The ID specialist provides expertise in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of IE management. Common clinical scenarios include non-infectious IE, culture-negative IE, extra-cardiac foci of infection, and identification or unusual or atypical microorganisms that must be distinguished from contamination isolated from blood or other specimen sources. The ID specialist has a crucial understanding of the clinical probability of IE, and must indicate when IE remains strongly suspected despite absence of imaging evidence to suggest infection. The ID specialist also guides appropriate investigation to identify the source of infection. The decision on duration of anti-microbial therapy, need and timing of synergistic combination antibiotic therapy, and mitigating the risk of adverse drug events require timely understanding, especially when surgical therapy or device extraction is planned. The ID specialist plays also a key role in adapting antibiotic doses in cases of renal insufficiency, in the choice of antibiotics in cases of allergy, in evaluating whether a course of antibiotics could be completed at home (outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment) and the appropriateness of transitioning from intravenous to oral antibiotics in select patients. In patients with IE episodes managed without surgery despite indications for such, decisions regarding whether long-term suppressive therapy is an option and, if so, what drug(s) are appropriate are better made by ID specialists.

### Infective endocarditis [^116RceJj]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is lethal if not aggressively treated with antibiotics alone or in combination with surgery. The epidemiology of this condition has substantially changed over the past four decades, especially in industrialized countries. Once a disease that predominantly affected young adults with previously well-identified valve disease — mostly chronic rheumatic heart disease — IE now tends to affect older patients and new at-risk groups, including intravenous-drug users, patients with intracardiac devices, and patients exposed to healthcare-associated bacteremia. As a result, skin organisms (for example, Staphylococcus spp.) are now reported as the pathogen in these populations more often than oral streptococci, which still prevail in the community and in native-valve IE. Moreover, progress in molecular diagnostics has helped to improve the diagnosis of poorly cultivable pathogens, such as Bartonella spp. and Tropheryma whipplei, which are responsible for blood-culture-negative IE more often than expected. Epidemiological data indicate that IE mostly occurs independently of medico-surgical procedures, and that circumstantial antibiotic prophylaxis is likely to protect only a minute proportion of individuals at risk. Therefore, new strategies to prevent IE — including improvement of dental hygiene, decontamination of carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, vaccination, and, possibly, antiplatelet therapy — must be explored.

Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) for infective endocarditis (IE) is being applied widely, despite the absence of controlled data that demonstrates that outcomes are equivalent to those with standard inpatient antibiotic therapy. We review existing OPAT guidelines, published data on the timing of complications from IE, and data on risk factors that can be used to predict complications. These data are used to propose more stringent criteria for patient selection and clinical management of OPAT for native valve IE. We recommend a conservative approach (inpatient or daily outpatient follow-up) during the critical phase (weeks 0–2 of treatment), when complications are most likely, and we recommend consideration of OPAT for the continuation phase (weeks 2–4 or 2–6 of treatment) when life-threatening complications are less likely.

Culture-negative infective endocarditis — diagnostic yield and empiric therapy: In a large prospective analysis of referred samples, identification of a pathogen occurred in 62.7% of 759 cases, a noninfectious origin in 2.5%, serological results were positive in 47.7%, PCR identified a pathogen in two thirds of the valves studied, and no cause was defined in 35% of cases. An evaluation of epidemiological factors, history of prior infections including cardiovascular infections, exposure to antimicrobials, clinical course, severe, and extracardiac sites of infection of the current infection should be performed in all culture-negative endocarditis cases (Class I; Level of Evidence C), and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended (Class I; Level of Evidence C). For acute (days) native valve infection presentations, coverage for S aureus, β-hemolytic streptococci, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), whereas for subacute (weeks) NVE, coverage of S aureus, VGS, HACEK, and enterococci is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). For culture-negative prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), coverage for staphylococci, enterococci, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli is reasonable if onset of symptoms is within 1 year of prosthetic valve placement (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C); if symptom onset is > 1 year after valve placement, antibiotic therapy for staphylococci, VGS, and enterococci is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). If subsequent blood culture results or other laboratory methodologies define a pathogen, then empirical therapy should be revised to focused therapy that is recommended for the specific pathogen identified (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

Staphylococcus aureus right-sided native valve infective endocarditis (NVE) in injection drug users — aminoglycosides and alternatives: A growing body of evidence suggests adjunctive aminoglycosides are unnecessary and may cause harm, and use of adjunctive gentamicin for S aureus bacteremia or right-sided NVE is discouraged. In 2006, daptomycin (6 mg·kg−1·d−1) was approved for S aureus bacteremia and right-sided S aureus IE, and a registrational trial showed patients did equally well with daptomycin monotherapy versus therapy including low-dose gentamicin for the first 4 days. In the predefined MRSA bacteremia subgroup, daptomycin success was 44.4% versus 31.8% with standard therapy (absolute difference, 12.6%, 95% confidence interval, −7.4 to 32.6; P = 0.28), and post hoc analysis found even low-dose, short-course gentamicin was significantly associated with renal toxicity. Thus, either parenteral β-lactam or daptomycin short-course therapy is adequate for uncomplicated MSSA right-sided IE, and Recommendation 1 states: "Gentamicin is not recommended for treatment of right-sided staphylococcal NVE (Class III; Level of Evidence B)".

Approach to Empirical Management of

Consensus is currently lacking about the optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for cases of BCNE, highlighting the importance of consulting with an infectious diseases specialist. Within this writing group, there were divergent practices. Antibiotic regimens used in the United States and Europe vary due to discrepancies in antibiotic availability, organism prevalence, and resistant patterns, and valve type affected and timing of presentation (eg, acute versus subacute). A clear distinction must be made between BCNE in patients who received antibiotics before blood cultures were sampled, when empirical treatment should primarily target methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, and BCNE in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, where empirical treatment active on fastidious organisms such as Bartonella spp, C burnetii, and T whipplei may be warranted.

Antimicrobial treatment perspectives in infective endocarditis (IE) note that initial therapy is empirical and is revised once a pathogen and susceptibilities are defined, and infectious diseases consultation should occur at empirical therapy initiation. It is reasonable for the counting of days for the duration of therapy to begin on the first day on which blood cultures are negative, and it is reasonable to obtain 2 sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until clearance. After valve surgery, an entire course of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable if resected valve tissue is culture positive or a perivalvular abscess is found, whereas if tissue is culture negative, it may be reasonable for the duration of postoperative treatment given less the number of days of treatment administered for native valve infection before valve replacement. Retrospective data from 2 medical centers suggest that 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy may be sufficient after surgery when valve tissue cultures are negative, particularly in IE caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis); whether 2 weeks is sufficient with positive valve cultures was not addressed in one survey and included only 5 patients in another, and histopathological Gram staining with negative cultures is not a factor in defining length of therapy after surgery.

### Clinical practice update on infectious endocarditis [^111HZExB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Infectious endocarditis is a highly morbid disease with approximately 43,000 cases per year in the United States. The modified Duke Criteria have poor sensitivity; however, advances in diagnostic imaging provide new tools for clinicians to make what can be an elusive diagnosis. There are a number of risk stratification calculators that can help guide providers in medical and surgical management. Patients who inject drugs pose unique challenges for the health care system as their addiction, which is often untreated, can lead to recurrent infections after valve replacement. There is a need to increase access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders in this population. Recent studies suggest that oral and depo antibiotics may be viable alternatives to conventional intravenous therapy. Additionally, shorter courses of antibiotic therapy are potentially equally efficacious in patients who are surgically managed. Given the complexities involved with their care, patients with endocarditis are best managed by multidisciplinary teams.

### Infective endocarditis: innovations in the management of an old disease [^116j3FD8]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The annual incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) is estimated to be between 15 and 80 cases per million persons in population-based studies. The incidence of IE is markedly increased in patients with valve prostheses (> 4 per 1,000) or with prior IE (> 10 per 1,000). The interaction between platelets, microorganisms and diseased valvular endothelium is the cause of vegetations and valvular or perivalvular tissue destruction. Owing to its complexity, the diagnosis of IE is facilitated by the use of the standardized Duke-Li classification, which combines two major criteria (microbiology and imaging) with five minor criteria. However, the sensitivity of the Duke-Li classification is suboptimal, particularly in prosthetic IE, and can be improved by the use of PET or radiolabelled leukocyte scintigraphy. Prolonged antibiotic therapy is mandatory. Indications for surgery during acute IE depend on the presence of haemodynamic, septic and embolic complications. The most urgent indications for surgery are related to heart failure. In the past decade, the prevention of IE has been reoriented, with indications for antibiotic prophylaxis now limited to patients at high risk of IE undergoing dental procedures. Guidelines now emphasize the importance of nonspecific oral and cutaneous hygiene in individual patients and during health-care procedures.

In cases of brain abscess complicating MSSA IE, nafcillin is preferred rather than cefazolin due to inadequate blood-brain barrier penetrability, and if nafcillin cannot be tolerated, vancomycin should be used.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^114rJxHb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Over the past 10 years a general move has been to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save cost and to prevent the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although this could have played a part in the reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction, its coincidence with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data that show a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not completely tackle the problem of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly answer this question a carefully designed, randomised, placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

Interpretation of the findings

Given that oral viridians group streptococci are clearly implicated in some cases of infective endocarditis, our findings provide support for the growing view that the frequent episodes of bacteraemia that follow daily routines such as eating and tooth brushing may be a greater risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis than the transient bacteraemia that follows an invasive dental procedure. Furthermore, the evidence that the bacteraemia after tooth brushing is significantly greater and more common in patients with poor oral hygiene and gingival diseasesuggests that improving oral hygiene might be more effective at reducing the number of cases caused by oral bacteria than providing antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental procedures.

Infective endocarditis (IE) surgery to prevent embolization is contextualized as follows: The traditional indication for valvular surgery for IE to avoid embolization has been ≥ 2 major embolic events, and because of the observed decreases in embolic risk during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the benefit of surgery in avoiding catastrophic embolic events is greatest early in the treatment course of IE.

transplant recipients with valve regurgitation; congenital cyanotic heart diseases unrepaired or with residual shunt; and those with a history of IE36) and who are undergoing dental procedures where there is likely a greater risk of bacteremia. 36 Of note, a 2022 study by Vähäsarja et al37 found no increased incidence of oral streptococcal IE among high-risk individuals following a recommendation to no longer administer antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry. Little high-quality evidence is available to guide selection of empirical therapy for known or suspected IE. Observational studies have suggested that IE outcomes may be improved by consulting infectious diseases experts.

42, 43 Empirical regimens are generally selected to cover the most likely potential causes based on the history and physical examination incorporating risk factors or clues for the source of infection and/or local antimicrobial resistance patterns. In general, a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin and a β-lactam like ceftriaxone, and whether the infection is of a native or prosthetic valve. This treatment regimen complexity has limited the availability of high-quality comparative outcomes studies.

### Treatment… [^115LRU9T]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Epidemiology Patients with most congenital heart malformations, acquired valvular defects, prosthetic valves and previous bacterial endocarditis are at increased risk for bacterial endocarditis. While virtually any bacterial organism can cause bacterial endocarditis, the vast majority of infections are caused by gram-positive cocci. The viridans group of streptococci is the most common cause of endocarditis involving native heart valves in patients with congenital heart disease and in patients who are not injection drug users. is a relatively common cause of bacterial endocarditis in patients with valvular prostheses. 8 Enterococci are causative agents in approximately 5 to 10 percent of bacterial endocarditis cases reported in several series. 5 Streptococcus bovis occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis in patients with an underlying colon malignancy or other intestinal disorder.

Approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients who are not injection drug users and who have native valve endocarditis are infected with a slow-growing gram-negative bacillus of the HACEK group 9. The challenge is greater when the infecting organism has reduced sensitivity to antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic therapy is based on several factors, including the identity of the infecting organism, the profile of antibiotic sensitivity of the organism, the pharmacokinetics of antibiotic agents, and the individual characteristics of the patient. A more extensive discussion of treatment recommendations for bacterial endocarditis is available from the American Heart Association.
12.

VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI Infection with viridans streptococci is a common cause of endocarditis involving native valves with preexisting congenital or acquired defects. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is increasingly identified as a cause of bacterial endocarditis, particularly in patients with prosthetic valves, right-sided endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug use, and nosocomial endocarditis. 8 These organisms are also resistant to cephalosporins. Patients with native valve endocarditis due to MRSA should be treated with vancomycin for four to six weeks.

### Clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of infective endocarditis in the 21st century… [^113U7dtB]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Recent health care exposure was found in one-quarter of patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. The mitral and aortic valves were infected most commonly. The following complications were common: stroke, embolization other than stroke, heart failure, and intracardiac abscess. Baseline characteristics and predisposing factors are shown in Table 2. The median age of the cohort was
57. 9 years. Most of the patients in the cohort had native valve IE, and most patients were admitted within 1 month of the initial signs of illness. Predisposing conditions were common in patients with definite IE. Although intravenous drug use remains important, the most common predisposing conditions were related to valvular heart disease. Degenerative valve disease was the most frequent native valve predisposing factor. In 2756 of the 2781 patients, blood samples were cultured to determine the causative microorganism. Of the 310 patients with negative blood culture yields, 192 had received antibiotics within 7 days of the blood culture. In addition to blood culture information, serologic tests and valve cultures were performed in a minority of cases. Of the 2781 patients, 277 had cultures and serologic tests that were negative for IE. Another observation arising from this investigation is the shift in the microbiologic characteristics of IE. Staphylococcus aureus is now the most common cause of IE in much of the world, confirming several recent investigations5, 16, 31 and the earlier findings of the ICE-PCS. 23 This shift is due in part to the global presence of risk factors for S aureus–associated IE.

Given the growing antimicrobial resistance of S aureus, 32 including to vancomycin, 33–35 the importance of this pathogen as a potentially lethal infection is cause for concern.
