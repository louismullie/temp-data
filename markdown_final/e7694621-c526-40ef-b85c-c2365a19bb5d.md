## Question

How does conduct disorder differ from adjustment disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how conduct disorder differs from adjustment disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about core definitions and diagnostic status. Then, onset and temporal patterns. Next, symptom profiles and specifiers. After that, etiology and risk factors, including neurobiology. Then, neurocognitive and stress reactivity features. Next, comorbidity, course, and prognosis. I should also review assessment tools and informant considerations. Finally, I will consider differential diagnosis and management implications to ensure clinical utility [^1126Hvag] [^116kp4We].

> Let me first confirm the core definitions to anchor the differential. Conduct disorder is a well-established disruptive behavior disorder marked by a persistent pattern of severe antisocial and aggressive behaviors beginning in childhood or adolescence, with extensively studied risk factors and trajectories, including progression to antisocial personality disorder in a subset of cases [^111xL6aq] [^1135oDJV] [^113a5rob]. In contrast, adjustment disorder in ICD-11 is conceptualized as a stress-response syndrome defined by preoccupation with the stressor and failure to adapt, whereas in DSM frameworks it has long been criticized as an ill-defined, subthreshold category with limited reliability and specificity, effectively serving as a clinical "wild card" when criteria for a major disorder are not met [^114itgFk] [^114sr18r] [^111mbhGR] [^114u9Nf3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about time course without verifying the diagnostic thresholds. For conduct disorder, the diagnosis requires a persistent and recurrent pattern, with multiple behaviorally-defined criteria across domains present over at least 12 months, which supports its characterization as a chronic externalizing syndrome rather than a transient reaction to stress [^111xL6aq] [^114yfD5k]. Adjustment disorder, by contrast, is explicitly tied to an identifiable stressor, may be diagnosed within days after stressor exposure, and is typically expected to resolve within six months after the stressor or its consequences end, framing it as time-limited unless stressors persist [^114itgFk] [^1139FRPS].

> Next, I should review the symptom profiles to ensure we are comparing like with like. For conduct disorder, the core symptoms cluster in four domains: aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules; a key specifier is the presence of callous-unemotional traits, which index a more severe phenotype with deficits in empathy and guilt and worse prognostic implications [^111xL6aq] [^114yfD5k]. For adjustment disorder under ICD-11, the core is narrow and centers on two symptom groups, preoccupation and failure to adapt, with emerging evidence favoring a unidimensional construct and ongoing debates about subtyping; notably, there is no fixed symptom count threshold as in most DSM categories, contributing to variability in application [^114itgFk] [^112S26tp] [^115ziv1P] [^114sr18r] [^111mbhGR].

> I will now examine etiology and risk factors, but I need to be careful with claims about causation. Conduct disorder arises from multifactorial, interacting genetic and environmental risks, with dispositional and contextual factors disrupting normative development to increase risk for aggression and antisocial behavior; this complexity supports multiple developmental pathways rather than a single cause [^111xL6aq] [^1135oDJV]. Adjustment disorder is classically framed as psychosocially determined by external stressors with risk modifiers such as female sex, younger age, unemployment, medical illness or injury, low social support, and prior mental health disorders; I initially thought this meant it was exclusively psychosocial, but wait, let me verify that assumption because recent genetic work suggests moderate heritability and genetic correlations with depression and anxiety, indicating the etiologic picture may not be purely environmental after all [^112qDHBD] [^1139FRPS] [^115CG84c].

> Next, I should review neurocognitive and stress reactivity profiles to see if they help differentiate. Conduct disorder is associated with structural and functional abnormalities in limbic and prefrontal circuits implicated in emotion processing, regulation, and reinforcement-based decision-making, as well as lower HPA axis and autonomic stress reactivity, supporting a neurobiological signature that aligns with its trait-like externalizing pattern [^111xL6aq]. For adjustment disorder, the biological underpinnings remain largely unexplored with no consistent neurocognitive or biomarker profile established to date, which fits its role as a stress-linked, context-sensitive diagnosis though, as noted, emergent genetic data may eventually refine this stance; I should double-check for updates when applying this in practice [^1139FRPS] [^115CG84c].

> Let me consider comorbidity and longitudinal course to avoid over- or under-diagnosing. Conduct disorder frequently co-occurs with ADHD and externalizing syndromes, and a subset progresses to antisocial personality disorder, with significant adult psychiatric comorbidity including substance use and mood disorders; trauma exposure and PTSD are also more common in individuals with a CD history, with CD symptoms typically preceding PTSD onset in those with both conditions [^111xL6aq] [^113a5rob] [^116Cnckb] [^1136G92J]. Adjustment disorder is generally self-limiting if the stressor resolves, but prognosis can be worse in adolescents and in contexts of chronic stressors, reinforcing the need to reassess for evolving depressive, anxiety, or trauma-related disorders over time; hold on, I should verify that adolescents indeed have poorer outcomes, which is supported by reviews noting prominent usage with concerning prognoses in that group [^114sr18r] [^114itgFk].

> I should confirm assessment strategies and measurement tools because misclassification is a common pitfall. Multi-informant assessment is crucial in pediatric externalizing disorders to mitigate same-rater bias, particularly for CD where cross-setting corroboration and functional impairment are needed; screeners like the PSC-17 can flag externalizing risks but are not diagnostic, whereas AjD-specific measures like the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire operationalize ICD-11 constructs of preoccupation and failure to adapt in a psychometrically sound way for case finding and monitoring; let me double-check comorbidity screening guidance, and yes, AAP recommends routine assessment for co-occurring CD, ODD, and substance use when evaluating ADHD given frequent overlap [^111itkap] [^111Yr4cv] [^114QbD9T] [^116XYQVH].

> But wait, what about the boundary conditions in differential diagnosis, especially around stress-related syndromes. Adjustment disorder must be distinguished from normative stress responses and from disorders like major depressive episodes and PTSD; ICD-11 deliberately simplifies PTSD to three core symptom clusters and emphasizes clinical judgment and impairment to draw boundaries, while also allowing AjD diagnosis within days of stressor exposure with the expectation of resolution, which can help avoid overpathologizing normal reactions if applied carefully; I should confirm that critics continue to cite vague criteria in DSM conceptualizations, and that is indeed a persistent theme in oncology and general medical settings where AjD's clinical utility has been questioned [^112oN3Lv] [^117RFRJX] [^114itgFk] [^114sr18r] [^1138sdW2].

> Next, I should review management implications because the nosology directly guides treatment selection. For conduct disorder, first-line treatments are parent- or family-based psychosocial interventions, with adjunctive pharmacotherapy such as stimulants or atypical antipsychotics considered particularly when ADHD is comorbid or aggression is severe; this aligns with its trait-like externalizing neurobehavioral profile and the need for multi-systemic, developmentally informed care [^111xL6aq]. For adjustment disorder, evidence for disorder-specific interventions is relatively sparse, so supportive psychotherapy, problem-solving approaches, and targeted treatments for emergent comorbid syndromes are typical while monitoring resolution as the stressor abates; I need to ensure not to medicalize self-limited reactions, which the literature repeatedly emphasizes alongside calls for improved intervention research [^1139FRPS] [^114sr18r].

> I should also consider clinical staging frameworks and transdiagnostic perspectives to contextualize evolving presentations in youth. Staging models for emerging mental disorders can help map progression from attenuated syndromes to threshold disorders and incorporate modifiers like comorbidity and functional impairment, which is relevant when an initial AjD diagnosis evolves into a mood, anxiety, or trauma-related disorder, or when early conduct problems consolidate into CD; let me verify the consensus statements and updates advocating for refined, transdiagnostic staging with attention to heterogeneity and extension, which is supported in recent position papers [^114cjUEX] [^112dGJSF].

> Summarizing the practical differentiators, I need to ensure I am anchoring CD on a persistent, cross-situational pattern of rule-breaking, aggression, deceit, and property destruction with possible callous-unemotional traits and neurocognitive/stress reactivity differences, often comorbid with ADHD, and with family-based treatments as core, whereas AjD should be tied tightly to an identifiable stressor with rapid onset of preoccupation and failure to adapt and an expected resolution within months once the stressor ends, applied judiciously to avoid pathologizing normal reactions and with vigilant reassessment for evolution into other disorders; if I overstate AjD as purely psychosocial, I should correct myself given emerging genetic correlations and the need for ongoing nosological refinement [^111xL6aq] [^114itgFk] [^114yfD5k] [^115CG84c] [^1139FRPS].

Conduct disorder (CD) is defined by a **persistent pattern of aggressive, deceitful, or rule-violating behavior** [^111xL6aq] that violates others' rights or societal norms, with onset in childhood or adolescence and a duration of at least 12 months [^1135oDJV] [^113a5rob]. In contrast, adjustment disorder (AD) is a **time-limited maladaptive response to an identifiable stressor** [^114itgFk], with emotional or behavioral symptoms developing within 3 months of the stressor [^111mbhGR] and resolving within 6 months after it ends [^1139FRPS]. CD is associated with significant functional impairment [^111xL6aq], high comorbidity (e.g. ADHD, substance use) [^116Cnckb], and a risk of progression to antisocial personality disorder [^113a5rob], requiring structured behavioral interventions and possibly pharmacotherapy [^1135oDJV]. AD typically resolves with removal of the stressor and supportive psychotherapy [^114sr18r] and has a favorable prognosis with a lower risk of chronicity or severe impairment [^1139FRPS].

| **Feature** | **Conduct disorder (CD)** | **Adjustment disorder (AD)** |
|-|-|-|
| Core features | Persistent pattern of aggressive, deceitful, or rule-violating behavior [^111xL6aq] violating others' rights or societal norms [^1135oDJV] | Maladaptive [^114sr18r] emotional or behavioral response to an identifiable stressor [^1139FRPS] |
| Onset and duration | Childhood or adolescence [^111xL6aq]; symptoms persist ≥ 12 months [^1135oDJV] | Symptoms begin within 3 months of stressor [^114sr18r]; resolve within 6 months after stressor ends [^1139FRPS] |
| Severity and impairment | Severe impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning [^111xL6aq]; high risk of legal problems [^1135oDJV] | Mild to moderate impairment [^114sr18r]; typically resolves with stressor removal [^1139FRPS] |
| Comorbidity | High comorbidity [^111xL6aq] with ADHD, substance use disorders [^116Cnckb], mood disorders [^1135oDJV] | Lower comorbidity [^114sr18r]; often co-occurs with anxiety or depressive symptoms [^1139FRPS] |
| Prognosis | Poor without intervention [^111xL6aq]; risk of progression to antisocial personality disorder [^1135oDJV] | Generally favorable [^114sr18r]; symptoms resolve with stressor removal and supportive therapy [^1139FRPS] |
| Treatment | Structured behavioral interventions (parent management training, CBT) [^111xL6aq]; pharmacotherapy for comorbidities [^1135oDJV] | Supportive psychotherapy, stress management, brief CBT [^114sr18r]; pharmacotherapy rarely indicated [^1139FRPS] |

CD involves **persistent, severe behavioral violations** [^111xL6aq] with significant impairment and a risk of chronicity, whereas AD is a **transient, stressor-linked reaction** [^114itgFk] that typically resolves with removal of the stressor and supportive care [^1139FRPS].

### Adjustment disorder: A diagnosis whose time has come [^1139FRPS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Adjustment disorder is among the most frequently diagnosed mental disorders in clinical practice, although it has received little academic attention and has been the subject of substantial criticism over the past decades. While those suffering from adjustment disorders are often treated by mental health professionals, research interest in the origin of the disorder or the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic and medical interventions has only recently begun to emerge. This article summarizes the empirical literature published on adjustment disorder and points out diagnostic developments in DSM-5 and ICD-11.

- **Methods**: Literature for this review was identified through established online search tools, including publications in English, German, and Spanish.

- **Results**: This paper reviews literature on the evolution of adjustment disorder and highlights the state of research regarding genesis and treatment. Importantly, for the first time, ICD-11 intends to define adjustment disorder by explicit symptom groups, unlike DSM-5.

- **Limitations**: Publications without an English abstract were not included.

- **Conclusions**: Key directions for future research include investigating the concordance of the ICD-11 and DSM-5 concepts and the effect that the diverging conceptualizations may have. Risk and protective factors specific to adjustment disorder should be identified, and the biological underpinnings of the disorder should be explored. Finally, given the high prevalence of adjustment disorder in certain clinical settings, effective disorder-specific interventions should be developed and evaluated.

### Conduct disorder [^111xL6aq]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2019). Low credibility.

Conduct disorder (CD) is a common and highly impairing psychiatric disorder that typically emerges in childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by severe antisocial and aggressive behavior. CD frequently co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and often leads to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. The disorder affects approximately 3% of school-aged children and is twice as prevalent in males as in females.

CD can be subtyped based on age at onset — either childhood-onset or adolescent-onset — and the presence or absence of callous-unemotional traits, which include deficits in empathy and guilt. The etiology of CD is complex, involving contributions from both genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as their interplay, such as gene-environment interaction and correlation.

- **Neurocognitive impairments**: CD is associated with smaller grey matter volume in limbic regions, including the amygdala, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Functional abnormalities in overlapping brain circuits responsible for emotion processing, emotion regulation, and reinforcement-based decision-making have been reported.

- **Stress reactivity**: Lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic reactivity to stress are also noted in individuals with CD.

Management of CD primarily involves parent-based or family-based psychosocial interventions. However, stimulants and atypical antipsychotics are sometimes prescribed, especially for individuals with comorbid ADHD.

### Current perspectives on conduct disorder [^1135oDJV]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Conduct disorder refers to a pattern of severe antisocial and aggressive behavior manifested in childhood or adolescence. This psychiatric diagnosis has been one of the most widely studied of all childhood disorders, and this extensive body of research has documented a large number of dispositional and contextual risk factors that can play a role in the etiology of this disorder. In this article, we provide a model for understanding these risk factors that uses developmental theory to specify how these risk factors can negatively affect normative developmental mechanisms to place a child at risk for acting in an aggressive and antisocial manner. We recognize that there may be different mechanisms operating among individuals with this disorder. This approach to understanding the development of conduct disorder has important implications for diagnostic classification systems and for designing more effective interventions for youth with conduct disorder.

### Adjustment disorders: The state of the art [^114sr18r]. World Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Adjustment disorders are common yet under-researched mental disorders. The present classifications fail to provide specific diagnostic criteria and relegate them to sub-syndromal status. They also fail to provide guidance on distinguishing them from normal adaptive reactions to stress or from recognized mental disorders such as a depressive episode or post-traumatic stress disorder. These gaps run the risk of pathologizing normal emotional reactions to stressful events on one hand, and on the other, of overdiagnosing depressive disorder with the consequent unnecessary prescription of antidepressant treatments.

Few of the structured interview schedules used in epidemiological studies incorporate adjustment disorders. They are generally regarded as mild, notwithstanding their prominence as a diagnosis in those dying by suicide and their poor prognosis when diagnosed in adolescents. There are very few intervention studies.

Prolonged grief disorder

The inclusion of this disorder in the ICD-11 followed careful consideration of the boundaries between normal and atypically severe grief, as well as cultural and religious influences on the grieving processes. The evidence was judged sufficient to introduce a formal diagnosis for the minority of grieving individuals who may need professional services to overcome persistent and severe mourning. The disorder is characterized by a pervasive longing for, or persistent preoccupation with the deceased, accompanied by intense emotional pain. It can only be diagnosed if the symptoms persist beyond a period of six months, or longer if extended periods of acute grief are culturally normative for that individual. In contrast to PTSD, where intrusive memories are generally characterized by fear or horror, preoccupation and longing often involve positive memories about the lost loved one. In the DSM-5, the evidence was only considered sufficient to include a somewhat differently defined "condition for further study" involving symptoms lasting for at least 12 months following a death, termed "persistent complex bereavement disorder".

Adjustment disorder

This frequently used but ill-defined diagnosis has been reformulated more precisely in the ICD-11. It is characterized by the presence of two symptoms: preoccupation with the stressors and indications of failure to adapt, such as sleep or concentration problems. It can be assigned some days after the stressor has impacted the person, and it is typically expected to resolve within six months unless the stressor persists.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^112PJ8Ak]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although treatment algorithms and parameters for best practice are readily available for all major syndromes of psychiatric impairment, the occurrence of psychiatric syndromes in individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) poses serious contextual challenges for the interpretation of symptoms, diagnosis, and optimization of treatment. These challenges affect both clinicians and the service sectors in which care and support of individuals with IDD are delivered. Recognizing that there are very few definitive resources for best practice in the context of this form of "dual diagnosis", the Missouri Department of Mental Health convened an expert panel. This panel conducted a focused review and synthesis of the relevant scientific literature to develop guidance in the form of decision support for clinicians. This article summarizes the findings for three of the most common and impairing clusters of psychiatric symptoms that co-occur with IDD: aggression, depression, and addictions.

Individuals with IDD are at high risk for the development of psychiatric symptoms, which often manifest uniquely in IDD, and evidence for effective intervention is steadily accruing. Interventions commonly implemented in the IDD service sector, such as functional communication training and positive behavioral support planning, are capable of mitigating severe behavioral impairment. However, they are rarely invoked when dual diagnosis patients are seen in the psychiatric service sector. Conversely, state-of-the-art interventions for traumatic stress are also discussed.

### Examining the clinical correlates of conduct disorder in youth with bipolar disorder [^112woruT]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Conduct disorder (CD) is highly comorbid with bipolar disorder (BP), and this comorbidity is associated with high morbidity and dysfunction. We sought to better understand the clinical characteristics and familiality of comorbid BP + CD by examining children with BP with and without comorbid CD.

- **Methods**: 357 subjects with BP were derived from two independent datasets of youth with and without BP. All subjects were evaluated with structured diagnostic interviews, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and neuropsychological testing. We stratified the sample of subjects with BP by the presence or absence of CD and compared the two groups on measures of psychopathology, school functioning, and neurocognitive functioning. First-degree relatives of subjects with BP, with and without CD, were compared on rates of psychopathology in relatives.

- **Results**: Subjects with BP + CD compared to BP without CD had significantly more impaired scores on the CBCL Aggressive Behavior (p < 0.001), Attention Problems (p = 0.002), Rule-Breaking Behavior (p < 0.001), Social Problems (p < 0.001), Withdrawn/Depressed clinical scales (p = 0.005), the Externalizing Problems (p < 0.001), and Total Problems composite scales (p < 0.001). Subjects with BP + CD had significantly higher rates of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (p = 0.002), any SUD (p < 0.001), and cigarette smoking (p = 0.001). First-degree relatives of subjects with BP + CD had significantly higher rates of CD/ODD/ASPD and cigarette smoking compared to first-degree relatives of subjects without CD.

### Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder: A review of the past 10 years, part II [^113a5rob]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

To review empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented. Research on ODD and CD during this period has explored the complexity involved in identifying the primary risk factors and developmental pathways to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). In some domains, research is advancing into a new phase due to the availability of new technologies. In others, larger data sets and more sophisticated methodological and statistical techniques are testing increasingly complex models. However, questions remain regarding the most effective subtyping systems, the identification of the most significant risk factors, and the relationships between risk factors from multiple domains.

Convincing evidence of causal linkages remains elusive. Research has questioned the notion that CD is intractable, especially when multiple domains of risk and impairment are targeted by interventions. There is no single causative factor; therefore, a single modality is unlikely to suffice in treating CD. Future steps will involve restructuring diagnostic criteria to capture adequate subtypes and indicators, clarifying the neurological underpinnings of the disorder, and refining models available to explain the varied pathways to DBD.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^114ztx9P]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children, inattentive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. The primary purpose of this tool is to identify children who exhibit a significant number of inattentive behaviors, which are disruptive and inappropriate for their developmental level, for at least six months.

The diagnostic criteria consist of nine inattention-related behaviors: failing to give close attention to details, having trouble holding attention on tasks, not listening when spoken to directly, not following through on instructions, having trouble organizing tasks, avoiding tasks that require mental effort, losing things necessary for tasks, being easily distracted, and being forgetful in daily activities. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score.

The presence of symptoms for at least six months, to the extent that it is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level, is a crucial component of the diagnostic criteria. This criterion significantly contributes to the overall score.

The diagnosis of ADHD, inattentive subtype, is confirmed if the total score is equal to or greater than 106. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, inattentive subtype, are not met. This scoring system allows clinicians to quantify the severity of inattentive behaviors and make a more objective diagnosis.

### The PSC-17: A brief pediatric symptom checklist with psychosocial problem subscales. A report from PROS and ASPN [^111Yr4cv]. Ambul Child Health (1999). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17)" is designed to screen for generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, adjustment disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and major depressive disorder.

The Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17) is a psychosocial screening tool designed to facilitate the recognition of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems in pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years. It helps clinicians identify children who may benefit from further mental health assessment and intervention. The PSC-17 covers three domains: internalizing problems, attention problems, and externalizing problems. It is not suitable for children under 4 years of age or for those with severe cognitive impairment, as they may not accurately understand or respond to the questions.

The PSC-17 is a diagnostic tool used to identify behavioral and emotional problems in children. It consists of 17 items across three symptom domains: attention, internalizing, and externalizing. For each item, caregivers report how frequently a child exhibits a particular symptom by selecting one of three response options: "Never, 0", "Sometimes, +1", or "Often, +2". These responses are scored to measure the severity of symptoms.

- **Scoring process**: The scoring process involves assigning numerical values to the responses:
	- "Never, 0" is assigned 0 points
	- "Sometimes, +1" is assigned 1 point
	- "Often, +2" is assigned 2 points

The calculation involves summing up the scores across the 17 items.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^115LysWC]. Current psychiatry reports (2020). Low credibility.

Our review identified a number of recent translational advances in the management of specific psychiatric syndromes in individuals with autism — fewer in those with intellectual disability — and very few scientific articles in which comprehensive approaches to symptom identification/interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment of specific combinations of intellectual/developmental disability (IDD) and psychiatric syndromes (PS) were implemented and evaluated. The evidence base summarized here emphasizes the importance of tailoring the management of psychiatric syndromes to the unique context of a given intellectual or developmental disability. This considers the widely varying consequences of such conditions on the capacity for communication and engagement in intervention, the function of behavioral impairment, and the manner in which psychiatric symptoms manifest.

- **Clinical trials and systematic reviews**: Table 2 provides a listing of selected clinical trials and systematic reviews, published over the past 5 years, documenting evidence for specific intervention modalities for autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) and aggression, depression, or addictions. Symptom identification must include careful consideration of precipitating factors for psychiatric symptoms that are accentuated in the context of developmental disability and the increased vulnerability to and impact of trauma.

- **Diagnostic formulation**: Factors that may be less easily communicated by IDD populations must be considered in diagnostic formulation, including traumatic experiences that may be viewed by the community as relatively trivial, medical conditions that incur pain, and the recognition of differences between individuals with IDD and their peers.

### Clinical staging and the differential risks for clinical and functional outcomes in young people presenting for youth mental health care [^116VAtiL]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, this study supports the utility of the clinical staging model in determining differential likelihoods of poor multidimensional outcomes emerging over 12 months. Clinical stage was not associated with the longitudinal risk of developing alcohol or substance misuse and physical health comorbidity. This provides insights for further research to clarify whether these outcomes emerge independent of stage. By demonstrating a greater risk of broader illness impacts for young people with more severe illnesses, these findings support the combined utility of clinical staging and multidimensional assessment in youth mental health care services to guide early intervention and targeted treatment plans.

### Psychometric and factorial validity of the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ) in an Italian sample: A validation and prevalence estimate study [^114QbD9T]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Adjustment disorder (AjD) is a maladaptive emotional or behavioral reaction to a stressful event or change in a person's life. Compared to other previously validated tools, the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ) stands out as one of the most reliable and handy tools for AjD. As no homologous instrument exists currently, this study aimed to validate an Italian version of the IADQ.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one thousand two hundred and six subjects (80.4% females) during the initial stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were recruited. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), testing two latent models: a monofactorial and a bifactorial model. Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the total and the two factors' scores with measures of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. We also estimated the rates of AjD among the population and conducted a binary logistic regression to analyze the predictors of the disorder.

- **Results**: The CFA showed bifactorial validity, with both excellent incremental and comparative fit indices. The IADQ scores correlated strongly with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. In the Italian sample, the prevalence of probable AjD was 8.23%. Female gender, being engaged, widowed, and having COVID-19-related stressors were significant independent risk factors for AjD.

- **Conclusions**: The IADQ is an easy-to-use, brief, and psychometrically sound self-report measure for AjD. Thus, it may be considered a reliable tool for both research and clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, our findings highlight its effectiveness.

### The problem of same-rater bias [^111itkap]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnostic process in child and adolescent psychiatry relies heavily on information from multiple informants, including parents, teachers, and the child itself. It has long been well known that information from informants who see the child in different settings may differ, but that each type of informant may contribute useful and unique information to the prediction of mental health problems. The diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) depends on reports from informants who see the child in different settings. This is illustrated in the DSM-5, in which the diagnostic criteria require several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms to be present in two or more settings.

### Depressive spectrum disorders in cancer: Diagnostic issues and intervention. A critical review [^1138sdW2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In spite of the high prevalence of adjustment disorders in cancer settings (20–25%), the diagnostic features and the clinical utility of diagnosing these disorders with depressed mood or mixed features (anxiety and depression) in cancer, as well as in medically ill patients in general, have been repeatedly questioned. The main characteristics of adjustment disorder and its sub-types have been reported to be vague and imprecise, lacking clinical utility, particularly in oncology. The lack of guidance on distinguishing normal from abnormal stress reactions, the absence of specific diagnostic criteria in terms of symptom numbers or behavioral parameters, and the inadequate operationalization to differentiate adjustment from adaptation, socialization, and coping have been noted.

Although criteria were proposed to be slightly modified in cancer settings and despite the DSM-5 now classifying the disorder under Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders, its definition and diagnostic criteria continue to be criticized. By examining patients diagnosed with adjustment disorders and major depression, it has been reported that many different sub-types (e.g. adjustment disorders with features of alexithymia, major depression with irritable mood) are possible in medically ill, including cancer patients. However, this does not imply that all these phenomenological conditions are separate and represent specific diagnoses.

### Exclusion criteria in the diagnostic classifications of DSM-IV and ICD-10: Revisiting the co-occurrence of psychiatric syndromes [^111Z9hyb]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria are present in almost all diagnostic categories in both DSM-IV and ICD-10. These criteria state that one diagnosis is not made if it is "due to" another disorder. However, there is little empirical evidence demonstrating that the hierarchy imposed by the exclusion criteria is meaningful. The study examines associations between ten common mental disorder pairs to determine whether they are higher for disorder pairs that are classified in DSM-IV and/or ICD-10 as having a hierarchical relationship than for those that are not hierarchically related.

- **Method**: Data were analysed from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, a large (N = 10,641) epidemiological survey of mental disorders. Bivariate odds ratios between disorder pairs were calculated using logistic regression analyses. Multivariate odds ratios were also calculated from separate logistic regression analyses, in which the sample was restricted to likely positive cases, and co-morbid mental disorders and neuroticism scores were both controlled.

- **Results**: The odds ratios between disorder pairs related according to the exclusion criteria were higher than those of unrelated disorders, for both DSM-IV and ICD-10. When constraints were placed on the data to control for the effects of co-morbid disorders and neuroticism, the same pattern was evident in DSM-IV but not in ICD-10.

- **Conclusion**: The patterns of association between disorder pairs found in the exclusion criteria for DSM-IV appear to more closely mirror the patterns of association found in epidemiological data, suggesting a potential discrepancy in ICD-10.

### Adjustment disorder: New developments [^111mbhGR]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Adjustment disorders (ADs) have been included in psychiatric classifications since 1952, although their name has changed over time. In DSM-5, they have been classified under trauma and stress-related disorders for the first time. Despite this positive step, there are still problems with the classification of ADs. There is no guidance on the distinction from normal stress reactions; it remains a subthreshold category, and the subtypes are not strongly underpinned by research.

There are no specific diagnostic criteria in terms of symptom numbers or combinations, unlike most other conditions classified in the DSM. Apart from epidemiological studies in those with medical illnesses, recent prevalence studies in other populations are scarce. Research is lacking in many aspects of AD, especially concerning their biological underpinnings and treatments. One factor contributing to this is the absence of adequate diagnostic interview schedules. Interest in ADs may increase now that they are classified with the trauma-related group of disorders.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^116kp4We]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Overall, our view is that the various changes made in the mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders chapter of the ICD-11 contribute to a significant advancement in diagnostic classification as well as in mental health practice and research. However, the ways in which the ICD-11, as well as other important frameworks, including the DSM-5 and the Research Domain Criteria, have and have not advanced the field need to be further understood. In order to do so, two key issues, namely causality and thresholding, should be addressed.

Medical classifications that are based on etiology have important advantages; such a classification system itself provides clear targets for intervention. In the case of mental disorders, this is not possible because the etiology of mental disorders is not only multicausal but also incompletely understood. Importantly, the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders incorporates the issues of etiology in a number of ways — certain groupings of disorders reflect common underlying mechanisms (e.g. disorders of addictive behavior), certain diagnoses are based on specified causes (e.g. anxiety due to substance use or to a medical disorder), and certain causal factors can be classified (e.g. in the chapter on Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services) but are not considered to be disorders. Continuous revisions of the nosology are important in ensuring that etiology is included to the maximal extent possible.

### An examination of the relation between conduct disorder, childhood and adulthood traumatic events, and posttraumatic stress disorder in a nationally representative sample [^1136G92J]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical data have indicated that exposure to trauma and meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common among individuals with a history of conduct disorder. However, these relationships have not been adequately examined in a population-based sample.

- **Methods**: Data were drawn from Wave 2 of the U.S. National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) collected in 2004–2005 (n = 34,653, response rate = 86.7%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine relations between conduct disorder, traumatic life events, and PTSD in the full sample, and separately for males and females.

- **Results**: The main findings indicate that childhood maltreatment was associated with conduct disorder (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] ranging from 2.4 to 4.7) after adjustment for sociodemographic variables. Additionally, respondents with a history of conduct disorder compared to respondents without conduct disorder were more likely to report experiencing any traumatic event (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI = 2.0–3.6) and PTSD (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.8–2.7) after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Although sex differences were noted, conduct disorder was associated with the greatest odds of assaultive violence for males and females. The majority of individuals (72.9%) diagnosed with both conduct disorder and PTSD developed conduct disorder symptoms before PTSD symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Results of this study provide the first known sex-stratified examination of the relationship between conduct disorder, traumatic events, and PTSD.

### Is adjustment disorder genetically correlated with depression, anxiety, or risk-tolerant personality trait [^115CG84c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Adjustment disorder has three main subtypes: adjustment disorder with depressed mood, adjustment disorder with anxiety, and adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct. The disorder is moderately heritable and has lifetime comorbidities with major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, or risk-tolerant personality. However, it remains unclear whether the degrees of genetic correlations between adjustment disorder and other psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes are similar or different from those between MDD, anxiety disorders, or risk-tolerant personality and these other psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes.

To compare patterns of genetic correlations, we utilized large-scale genome-wide association study summary statistics for adjustment disorder-related disorders and personality trait, eleven other psychiatric disorders, and fifteen intermediate phenotypes. Adjustment disorder had highly positive genetic correlations with MDD, anxiety disorders, and risk-tolerant personality. Among other psychiatric disorders, adjustment disorder, MDD, anxiety disorders, and risk-tolerant personality were positively correlated with risks for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), SCZ+BD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and cross disorders. In contrast, adjustment disorder was not significantly correlated with risks for obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, or posttraumatic stress disorder, despite significant genetic correlations of MDD or anxiety disorders with these disorders.

### An empirical assessment of adjustment disorder as proposed for ICD-11 in a general population sample of Israel [^112S26tp]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A new diagnostic concept of adjustment disorder (AjD) was proposed for inclusion in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th version (ICD-11). However, the symptom structure of AjD is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the dimensionality of AjD as a stress-response syndrome.

- **Methods**: A general population sample of the Israeli population (N = 1003) completed the Adjustment Disorder - New Module 20 and the WHO-5 Wellbeing Scale. We compared seven alternative models of AjD using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed to determine if subtypes of AjD were present. The performance of the unidimensional and multidimensional models of AjD was evaluated using regression analyses.

- **Results**: CFA results supported a unidimensional model of AjD. The LPA identified three quantitatively distinct classes (low, medium, and high) with no evidence of any subtypes of AjD. The criterion validity of AjD was superior when treated as unidimensional. AjD was associated with lower levels of psychological wellbeing (β = -.32, p < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that AjD is better conceptualized as a unidimensional construct. Future work should focus on a reduction of required symptoms to improve the clinical utility and validity of the diagnosis.

### Optimizing the clinical utility of four proposed criteria for a persistent and impairing grief disorder by emphasizing core, rather than associated symptoms [^111w8apB]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Distinguishing a disorder of persistent and impairing grief from normative grief allows clinicians to identify this often undetected and disabling condition. As four diagnostic criteria sets for a grief disorder have been proposed, their similarities and differences need to be elucidated.

- **Methods**: Participants were family members bereaved by US military service death (N = 1732). We conducted analyses to assess the accuracy of each criteria set in identifying threshold cases (participants who endorsed baseline Inventory of Complicated Grief ⩾30 and Work and Social Adjustment Scale ⩾20) and excluding those below this threshold. We also calculated agreement among criteria sets by varying numbers of required associated symptoms.

- **Results**: All four criteria sets accurately excluded participants below our identified clinical threshold (i.e. correctly excluding 86–96% of those subthreshold), but they varied in identification of threshold cases (i.e. correctly identifying 47–82%). When the number of associated symptoms was held constant, criteria sets performed similarly. Accurate case identification was optimized when one or two associated symptoms were required. When employing optimized symptom numbers, pairwise agreements among criteria became correspondingly 'very good' (κ = 0.86–0.96).

- **Conclusions**: The four proposed criteria sets describe a similar condition of persistent and impairing grief but differ primarily in criteria restrictiveness. Diagnostic guidance for prolonged grief disorder in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11), functions effectively as a framework for understanding this condition.

### Idhifa [^1174q69d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: differentiation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety evaluation of single-agent IDHIFA is based on 214 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who were assigned to receive 100 mg daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The median duration of exposure to IDHIFA was 4.3 months (range 0.3 to 23.6). The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates observed with IDHIFA were 4.2% (9/214) and 11.7% (25/214), respectively.

- **Adverse reactions**: Serious adverse reactions were reported in 77.1% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were leukocytosis (10%), diarrhea (6%), nausea (5%), vomiting (3%), decreased appetite (3%), tumor lysis syndrome (5%), and differentiation syndrome (8%). Differentiation syndrome events characterized as serious included pyrexia, acute renal failure, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure.

- 43% of patients (92 of 214) required a dose interruption due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were differentiation syndrome (4%) and leukocytosis (3%). Ten of 214 patients (5%) required a dose reduction due to an adverse reaction; no adverse reaction required dose reduction.

### Somatic symptom disorder [^112UKgic]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this mental health condition. The primary purpose of this tool is to identify and categorize the severity of somatic symptom disorder in patients, based on the presence and duration of distressing somatic symptoms, the patient's thoughts and anxiety about these symptoms, and the time and energy devoted to these health concerns.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder comprises five main components. The first component requires the presence of one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or cause significant disruption of daily life. The second component necessitates that these symptoms have been present for six months or more, although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present. The third, fourth, and fifth components involve the patient's mental and emotional response to these symptoms, including disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of symptoms, persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms, and excessive time and energy devoted to the symptoms or health concerns, respectively.

The severity of the disorder is determined by the combination of these components. Severe somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed if the first two components are present along with any two or all three of the last components.

### The adjustment disorders: the conundrums of the diagnoses [^114u9Nf3]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This article discusses the conundrums and dilemmas of the conceptual framework of the diagnoses of adjustment disorders (ADs). The psychiatric diagnoses that arise between normal behavior and major psychiatric morbidities constitute problematic subthreshold disorders. These subthreshold entities are positioned between problem-level diagnoses and more clearly defined major disorders. They present important taxonomic and diagnostic dilemmas because they are often poorly defined, overlap with other diagnostic groupings, and have indefinite symptomatology.

ADs were designed as a "wild card" to allow the coding of a psychiatric "diagnosis" for work done by psychiatrists and other mental health care specialists when the patient's symptoms do not reach the criteria for a major mental disorder. It is not surprising that issues of reliability and validity prevail. The issues of diagnostic rigor and clinical utility appear at odds for AD. Clinicians need a wild card, and field studies need to use reliable and valid concepts of AD and assessment instruments to determine more exact specifications of the diagnosis parameters.

Finally, appropriate and timely treatment is essential for patients with AD to prevent symptom worsening, further impairment of important relationships, or compromise of their capacity to work, study, or engage in essential interpersonal pursuits.

### Staging 2.0: Refining transdiagnostic clinical staging frameworks to enhance reliability and utility for youth mental health [^112dGJSF]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Globally, 75% of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders emerge by age 25 years. However, these disorders are often preceded by non-specific symptoms or attenuated clinical syndromes. Difficulties in determining optimal treatment interventions for these emerging mental disorders, and uncertainties about accounting for co-occurring psychopathology and illness trajectories, have led many youth mental health services to adopt transdiagnostic clinical staging frameworks. In this Health Policy paper, an international working group highlights ongoing challenges in applying transdiagnostic staging frameworks in clinical research and practice and proposes refinements to the transdiagnostic model to enhance its reliability, consistent recording, and clinical utility.

- **Within-stage heterogeneity**: We introduce the concept of within-stage heterogeneity and describe the advantages of defining stage in terms of clinical psychopathology and stage modifiers.
- **Categorising stage modifiers**: Using examples from medicine, we discuss the utility of categorising stage modifiers into factors associated with progression (i.e. potential predictors of stage transition) and extension (i.e. factors associated with the presentation that add complexity to treatment selection).
- **Revising the framework**: Lastly, we suggest how it is possible to revise the currently used transdiagnostic staging approach to incorporate these key concepts, and how the revised framework could be applied in clinical and research practice.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^114DVnNM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In other words, what does not constitute a neurodevelopmental disorder among disorders that arise in childhood and adolescence? More importantly, what is the clinical utility of grouping them together and separating them from disruptive behavior and internalizing disorders? It is possible that mood and anxiety disorders are more closely associated with psychosocial adversity than with neurodevelopmental disorders; however, surely these are quantitative rather than qualitative differences. Furthermore, many evidence gaps remain in our understanding of etiology and pathogenesis, indicating that building the foundation of a classification system on unknown and assuredly complex etiological factors is a fragile enterprise. The term represents child and adolescent psychiatry's version of the old 'functional' versus 'organic' distinction, which has long been eliminated in adult psychiatry following remarkable advances in neuroscience. Perhaps it is time to put the term 'neurodevelopmental disorders' into the history books as well?

### The DSM-5: Classification and criteria changes [^1126Hvag]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), marks the first significant revision of the publication since the DSM-IV in 1994. Changes to the DSM were largely informed by advancements in neuroscience, clinical and public health needs, and identified problems with the classification system and criteria put forth in the DSM-IV. Much of the decision-making was also driven by a desire to ensure better alignment with the International Classification of Diseases and its upcoming 11th edition (ICD-11).

In this paper, we describe select revisions in the DSM-5, with an emphasis on changes projected to have the greatest clinical impact and those that demonstrate efforts to enhance international compatibility, including integration of cultural context with diagnostic criteria and changes that facilitate DSM-ICD harmonization. It is anticipated that this collaborative spirit between the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) will continue as the DSM-5 is updated further, bringing the field of psychiatry even closer to a singular, cohesive nosology.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^117RFRJX]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Medical classifications face the perennial problem of drawing thresholds among disorders as well as between such disorders and normality; this is a particularly fraught issue in mental disorders, where critics have raised concerns about inappropriate over-medicalization. The hope that advances in neuroscience would lead to biomarkers with sensitivity and specificity has not materialized. Importantly, given its focus on use in a wide range of settings, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse is providing diagnostic guidelines for the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders that allow flexible use of clinical judgment, rather than focusing on narrow stipulations of symptom counts or duration that may improve reliability but not necessarily validity. These ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for use in clinical settings have, however, undergone rigorous field testing; changes in the diagnostic guidelines from ICD-10 to ICD-11 are not simply arbitrary or capricious but rather reflect the outcome of ongoing developments in nosological science.

Nevertheless, the fact that the ICD-11 chapter relies on clinical guidelines rather than on specific cut-points to draw boundaries again raises a number of important considerations. First, the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines place a great deal of emphasis on the 'clinical criterion' — the distress and impairment that are associated with symptoms. Second, although dimensional constructs have been included in a number of places in the ICD-11, this remains a largely categorical system.

### Are oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms normative behaviors in preschoolers? A comparison of referred and nonreferred children [^116J4c9T]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The authors' goal was to test the hypothesis that DSM-IV symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder can be validly applied to preschoolers.

- **Method**: Using a semistructured diagnostic interview, they assessed rates of symptoms of DSM-IV oppositional defiant and conduct disorders in 2.5–5.5-year-old children who were referred to a psychiatry clinic and a comparison group of nonreferred children.

- **Results**: Clinically referred preschool children had significantly higher rates of oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms than nonreferred children. Among nonreferred preschoolers, rates of all oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms were at or below 8%.

- **Conclusions**: DSM-IV symptoms of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders distinguish referred from nonreferred preschool children in a pattern consistent with that seen in older children. Preschool children who are not seeking mental health services do not have high rates of disruptive behavior problems. The DSM-IV nosology appears to be a valid diagnostic system for discriminating between typical and atypical disruptive behaviors in preschool children.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^112oN3Lv]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The ICD-11 has substantially simplified the description of PTSD, defining it in terms of three core symptoms that most clearly distinguish PTSD from other disorders, namely re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present, deliberate avoidance of reminders, and a sense of ongoing threat. Furthermore, the symptoms must persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. In contrast, PTSD is the most complex disorder in the DSM-5, with 20 symptoms organized into four symptom clusters. The intention of the DSM-5 was to capture the full scope of chronic post-traumatic phenotypes. However, recent research has demonstrated that the data fit the simpler factor structure of the ICD-11 better than they do that of the DSM-5 and that, as intended, when using the ICD-11 definition, there is a reduction in the degree of comorbidity with major depression.

It has been argued for many years that chronic or repeated trauma leads to a more severe form of PTSD. The ICD-10 contained a partly overlapping predecessor diagnosis of 'enduring personality change after catastrophic experiences', which had very rarely been used in clinical practice and research. The ICD-11 defines complex PTSD as consisting of the three core PTSD symptoms described above accompanied by problems in affect regulation, negative self-beliefs, and relationship difficulties. Chronic or repeated trauma is a risk factor rather than a requirement for the diagnosis, which is based on the symptom presentation.

### Transdiagnostic clinical staging for childhood mental health: An adjunctive tool for classifying internalizing and externalizing syndromes that emerge in children aged 5–11 years [^114ShpqW]. Clinical child and family psychology review (2022). Low credibility.

Significant gaps exist in research to guide decisions on stage-appropriate treatments. The best empirically supported treatments (ESTs) for childhood mental health problems are tied to a single clinical diagnosis, while treatments for children in earlier clinical stages and/or presenting with nonspecific symptoms are less established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of treatment approaches that align with contemporary thinking on the developmental etiology underlying illness progression, as proposed by the clinical staging framework.

Following our model, we recommend building an evidence base of interventions stratified by clinical stage and illness subtype, taking into account individual clinical and biological characteristics underlying disease progression. Treatments could target specific biobehavioral features of temperamental vulnerability or adapt already existing ESTs to address neurocognitive deficits/excesses. Given that neuroadaptive sensitivity to environmental influences is high during childhood, we advocate for increased investment in psychosocial interventions that address the interplay between neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities and adverse environments, to ensure the safest yet effective front-line treatment options are available for children. Family-based treatments, for instance, represent a well-established EST for child and family maladjustment known to have long-term benefits for child cognitive development.

### Clinical staging and the differential risks for clinical and functional outcomes in young people presenting for youth mental health care [^115bLDor]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The cohort comprised 2,093 individuals; 60.4% were female with a baseline mean age of 18.16 years (standard deviation, SD 3.32). Baseline characteristics and pairwise comparisons for each clinical staging group are shown in Table 1. The median follow-up time was 183 days (range, 32–364) and the median number of observations per participant was 3 (range, 2–4). There were no differences in the number of observations (F(2,2090) = 1.92; P = 0.15) or follow-up time (F(2,2090) = 4.26; P = 0.014) between clinical staging groups.

Of the entire cohort (n = 2,901), 683 individuals were not followed up between 30 and 365 days (416 lost to follow-up and 267 followed up outside of this range). There were some differences in follow-up rates between the three staging groups (F(2,2776) = 68.259; P < 0.001). Specifically, those in stage 2+ were more likely to not be followed up compared to those in stage 1b (44.22% lost to follow-up vs. 22.44%; χ²(1) = 60.80; P < 0.001) and stage 1a (44.22% vs. 21.97%; χ²(1) = 52.52; P < 0.001). However, there was no difference in loss to follow-up rates between stages 1a and 1b (21.97% vs. 22.44%; χ²(1) = 0.05; P = 0.83).

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^113B8dNC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although extensive reviews of the literature exist on the clinical treatment of individual developmental and psychiatric disorders, there is much less information on the approach to patients with combined intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) and psychiatric syndromes (PS). Despite the limited literature on combined presentations, individuals with IDD are at a disproportionately high risk of developing PS.

The high level of unmet clinical needs of individuals with such comorbidities is compounded by the fragmentation of the municipal systems designated for their care, which are commonly divided into separate and non-overlapping bureaucracies — one for developmental disability and another for behavioral health services. Since patients with dual diagnoses may have severe and persistent impairments in adaptive function — a glossary for definitions of this and other selected terms is typically provided — they are often heavily reliant on governmental systems of care. Lack of knowledge and experience, and insufficient clinical infrastructure for patients with multiple disabilities results in less effective services and interventions, which often fail to meet the needs of individuals with co-occurring IDD and PS.

Understanding the causal origins of neuropsychiatric disorders reinforces epidemiologic evidence that comorbidity of PS occurs disproportionately among patients with IDD and that these two domains of neuropsychiatric impairment often overlap with respect to traceable molecular genetic causes.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Committee [^1166pWuR]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), provides diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, specifically for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype. This clinical tool is designed to assist in diagnosing this subtype of ADHD. The primary target population includes children exhibiting symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

- **Components of DSM-5 criteria**: The criteria include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors are fidgeting or squirming, leaving the seat when expected to remain seated, running or climbing inappropriately, an inability to engage in quiet leisure activities, excessive talking, blurting out answers prematurely, difficulty waiting turns, interrupting, and intruding on others. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall diagnostic score, which is used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

- **Course of the disorder**: The DSM-5 criteria also consider the duration and degree of these symptoms. The presence of symptoms for at least six months, to a degree that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly influences the overall score.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, help determine whether a child meets the diagnostic requirements for this subtype of ADHD.

### Symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and callous-unemotional traits as unique predictors of psychosocial maladjustment in boys: Advancing an evidence base for DSM-V [^114yfD5k]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The incremental utility of symptoms of conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and callous-unemotional (CU) traits for predicting psychosocial outcomes across multiple domains was examined in a community sample of 1,517 boys.

- **Method**: Several outcomes were assessed semiannually across a 2-year follow-up, including antisocial behavior, internalizing problems, peer conflict, and academic difficulties. Official criminal charges were also examined across adolescence.

- **Results**: CD symptoms emerged as the most robust predictor of future antisocial outcomes. However, ODD symptoms predicted later criminal charges and conduct problems, and CU traits were robustly associated with serious and persistent criminal behavior in boys. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms predicted increases in oppositional defiant behavior and conduct problems over time and were uniquely related to future academic difficulties. Both ADHD and ODD symptoms predicted social and internalizing problems in boys, whereas CU traits were associated with decreased internalizing problems over time.

- **Conclusions**: The findings have implications for revisions being considered as part of the DSM-V. Specifically, incorporating CU traits into the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) may help to further delineate boys at risk for severe and persistent delinquency. Although currently prohibited, allowing a diagnosis of ODD when CD is present may provide unique prognostic information about boys who are at risk.

### An organization- and category-level comparison of diagnostic requirements for mental disorders in ICD-11 and DSM-5 [^115SBgC5]. World Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the 5th edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). In 2019, the World Health Assembly approved the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). It has often been suggested that the field would benefit from a single, unified classification of mental disorders, although the priorities and constituencies of the two sponsoring organizations are quite different. During the development of the ICD-11 and DSM-5, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the APA made efforts toward harmonizing the two systems, including the appointment of an ICD-DSM Harmonization Group.

This paper evaluates the success of these harmonization efforts and provides a guide for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers describing the differences between the two systems at both the organizational and the disorder level. The organization of the two classifications of mental disorders is substantially similar. There are nineteen ICD-11 disorder categories that do not appear in DSM-5, and seven DSM-5 disorder categories that do not appear in the ICD-11.

We compared the Essential Features section of the ICD-11 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) with the DSM-5 criteria sets for 103 diagnostic entities that appear in both systems. We rated 20 disorders (19.4%) as having major differences, 42 disorders (40.8%) as having minor definitional differences, 10 disorders (9.7%) as having minor differences due to a greater degree of specification in DSM-5, and 31 disorders (30.1%).

### Clinical utility as a criterion for revising psychiatric diagnoses [^113Adgyy]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Changes in DSM-IV were guided by empirical data that mainly focused on improving diagnostic validity and reliability. Although many changes were made explicitly to enhance clinical utility, no formal effort was made to empirically determine actual improvements in clinical utility. The authors propose that future revisions of DSM empirically demonstrate improvement in clinical utility to clarify whether the advantages of changing the diagnostic criteria outweigh potential negative consequences.

- **Method**: The authors provide a formal definition of clinical utility and suggest evaluating the merits of a proposed change to DSM by considering its impact on the use of the diagnostic system, whether it enhances clinical decision-making, and whether it improves clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Evaluating change based on impact includes user acceptability and accuracy in applying diagnostic criteria. User acceptability can be measured by surveying user reactions, assessing acceptability in a field trial setting, and measuring ease of use. Accurate application entails comparing clinician assessments to expert assessments. Methods for evaluating adherence to practice guidelines assess impacts on clinical decision-making. Outcome improvement is measured by reduction in symptom severity, improvement in functioning, or prevention of negative outcomes.

Empirical methods should be employed to.

### Adjustment disorder as proposed for ICD-11: Dimensionality and symptom differentiation [^115ziv1P]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although adjustment disorder as a diagnostic category is widely used in clinical practice, it is critically discussed that it has not been conceptualized as a category with unique symptoms. Hence, the conceptualization of adjustment disorder is subject to substantive change in ICD-11, including core symptoms and additional features in a uni-faceted concept. Adjustment disorder was assessed with a self-rating instrument in a representative sample of the German general population (N = 2512).

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were applied to test the dimensionality of symptoms according to the new diagnostic concept. Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to test whether there are distinguishable subgroups with respect to symptomatology. A total of 2.0% of the sample were diagnosed with adjustment disorder according to the new diagnostic algorithm. The proposed six factor model shows best fit with good reliability of the factors in the CFA compared to competing models. However, the factors are highly correlated and not distinguishable.

The LCA identified three latent classes, reflecting low, mild, and moderate to severe symptoms. The findings support the uni-faceted concept of adjustment disorder as it is conceptualized in the new diagnostic concept in ICD-11 in a general population sample. This clearer diagnostic concept will inform research as well as clinical practice.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictors of adjustment disorders in adults [^112qDHBD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adjustment disorder is common in clinical practice, yet there is a lack of research on the etiology and epidemiology of adjustment disorders. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate predictors of adjustment disorders in adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. We included 70 studies that examined thirteen theoretically-derived and predefined predictors of adjustment disorders with a total of 3,449,374 participants.

- **Results**: We found that female gender, younger age, unemployed status, stress, physical illness and injury, low social support, and a history of mental health disorders predicted adjustment disorders. Most of these predictors differentiated individuals with adjustment disorders from individuals with no mental health disorders. Participants with adjustment disorders were more likely to have experienced accidents than those with posttraumatic stress disorder but were less likely to have experienced assaults and abuse, neglect, and maltreatment. More research is needed to identify factors that differentiate adjustment disorders from other mental health disorders.

- **Limitations**: Because very few studies adjusted for confounders (e.g. demographic variables, mental health histories, and a variety of stressors), it was not possible to identify independent associations between predictors and adjustment disorders.

- **Conclusions**: We identified a number of factors that predicted adjustment disorders compared to no mental health diagnosis. The majority of studies were rated as moderate or high credibility.

### Optimizing the clinical utility of four proposed criteria for a persistent and impairing grief disorder by emphasizing core, rather than associated symptoms [^114USFDM]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Distinguishing a disorder of persistent and impairing grief from normative grief allows clinicians to identify this often undetected and disabling condition. As four diagnostic criteria sets for a grief disorder have been proposed, their similarities and differences need to be elucidated.

- **Methods**: Participants were family members bereaved by US military service death (N = 1732). We conducted analyses to assess the accuracy of each criteria set in identifying threshold cases (participants who endorsed baseline Inventory of Complicated Grief ⩾30 and Work and Social Adjustment Scale ⩾20) and excluding those below this threshold. We also calculated agreement among criteria sets by varying numbers of required associated symptoms.

- **Results**: All four criteria sets accurately excluded participants below our identified clinical threshold (i.e. correctly excluding 86–96% of those subthreshold), but they varied in identification of threshold cases (i.e. correctly identifying 47–82%). When the number of associated symptoms was held constant, criteria sets performed similarly. Accurate case identification was optimized when one or two associated symptoms were required. When employing optimized symptom numbers, pairwise agreements among criteria became correspondingly 'very good' (κ = 0.86–0.96).

- **Conclusions**: The four proposed criteria sets describe a similar condition of persistent and impairing grief, but differ primarily in criteria restrictiveness. Diagnostic guidance for prolonged grief disorder in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11), functions to provide…

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^112m2W4V]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although treatment algorithms and parameters for best practice are readily available for all major syndromes of psychiatric impairment, the occurrence of psychiatric syndromes in individuals with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) presents serious contextual challenges for interpreting symptoms, diagnosis, and optimizing treatment, both for clinicians and for the service sectors in which care and support of individuals with IDD are delivered. Recognizing that there are very few definitive resources for best practice in this form of "dual diagnosis", the Missouri Department of Mental Health convened an expert panel to conduct a focused review and synthesis of the relevant scientific literature to develop guidance in the form of decision support for clinicians. This article summarizes the findings for three of the most common and impairing clusters of psychiatric symptoms that co-occur with IDD — aggression, depression, and addictions.

Individuals with IDD are at high risk for developing psychiatric symptoms (PS), which often manifest uniquely in IDD and for which evidence for effective intervention is steadily accruing.

Interventions commonly implemented in the IDD service sector (e.g. functional communication training and positive behavioral support planning) can mitigate severe behavioral impairment. However, they are rarely invoked when dual diagnosis patients are seen in the psychiatric service sector. Conversely, state-of-the-art interventions for trauma are not mentioned in this summary.

### Conduct disorder and adult psychiatric diagnoses: Associations and gender differences in the U.S. adult population [^116Cnckb]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

The authors' objective was to examine the presence of Axis I and II psychiatric disorders among adult males and females with a history in childhood and/or adolescence of conduct disorder (CD). Data were derived from a large national sample of the U.S. population. Face-to-face interviews of more than 34,000 adults aged 18 years and older were conducted during 2004–2005 using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity, CD was associated with all Axis I and II disorders, particularly substance use disorders (SUD), bipolar disorder, and histrionic personality disorders.

After adjusting for gender differences in the general population, men had significantly greater odds of social anxiety disorder and paranoid personality disorder, whereas women were more likely to have SUD. Furthermore, there was a dose-response relationship between the number of CD symptoms and risk for most psychiatric disorders. From a clinical standpoint, knowledge of the gender differences in associations of CD with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood may be informative of developmental pathways of the disorder, and of possible gender-specific risk factors. Early recognition and treatment of CD may help prevent the development of adult-onset disorders.

### Characteristics of nosologically informative data sets that address key diagnostic issues facing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) and International Classification of Diseases, eleventh edition (ICD-11) substance use disorders workgroups [^1123YFUF]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, many nosological issues have been addressed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) substance use disorders workgroups. Even with those efforts, there are key issues that have not been resolved and must be revisited or addressed de novo by the workgroups. These lingering points are broad due to the array of substances classified under the diagnostic umbrella of substance use disorders. They include substantive issues ranging from dimensional approaches, similar criteria for each substance, cut-points and thresholds, distinct abuse and dependence classifications, new criteria and drugs, to less substantive ones, such as the adjectives used to describe the severity of the behaviors.

- **Results**: This paper describes the characteristics of the data sets needed to resolve the key nosological issues. Ten points are described: (1) data must be true to nomenclature under study; (2) flexible regarding rearrangements of scoring algorithms; (3–4) able to assess substances individually and retain former versions of the criteria; (5) not rely on shortened versions; (6) utilize samples that are generalizable; (7) make diagnoses with transparent algorithms; (8) combine mixed methods for corroborating data; (9) utilize assessments that collect reliable and valid diagnoses and criteria; and (10) stretch the limits by allowing for new discoveries.

- **Conclusions**: This paper describes each of these and gives examples of the limitations and strengths of the data for the purpose.

### Transdiagnostic clinical staging in youth mental health: A first international consensus statement [^114cjUEX]. World Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Recognizing that frameworks for classification and treatment in psychiatry are inadequate, particularly for young people and early intervention services, transdiagnostic clinical staging models have gained prominence. These models aim to identify where individuals lie along a continuum of illness to improve treatment selection and better understand patterns of illness continuity, discontinuity, and aetiopathogenesis. All these factors are particularly relevant to help-seeking and mental health needs experienced during the peak age range of onset, namely the adolescent and young adult developmental periods (i.e. ages 12–25 years).

At the time of writing, progressive stages in transdiagnostic models have typically been defined by traditional symptom sets that distinguish "sub-threshold" from "threshold-level" disorders, even though both require clinical assessment and potential interventions. Here, we argue that staging models must go beyond illness progression to capture additional dimensions of illness extension, as evidenced by the emergence of mental or physical comorbidity/complexity or a marked change in a linked biological construct.

To develop further consensus in this nascent field, we articulate principles and assumptions underpinning transdiagnostic clinical staging in youth mental health, how these models can be operationalized, and the implications of these arguments for research and development of new service systems. We then propose an agenda for the coming decade, including knowledge gaps, the need for multi-stakeholder input, and a collaborative international approach.

### Beyond symptom improvement: Transdiagnostic and disorder-specific ways to assess functional and quality of life outcomes across mental disorders in adults [^113PDM88]. World Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Improving meaningful outcomes is the main goal of clinical care for mental disorders. Traditionally, the focus in clinical research and practice has been on outcome domains that refer to symptom severity or service use (e.g. hospitalization), relate to categorical diagnoses, and favor clinician-rated measures. More recently, self-rated and dimensional as well as transdiagnostic outcome domains have gained traction, with functioning, quality of life, and well-being/life satisfaction, along with the construct of personal recovery, becoming a stronger focus.

These key multidimensional outcome domains need to be properly defined and assessed. Further, the concepts of "functional" and "personal" recovery need to be differentiated.

- **Functional recovery**: Defined by observed functioning across the domains of self-care, social interactions, leisure time activities, and educational or vocational activities.
- **Personal recovery**: Involves the subjective sense of living a personally meaningful life, irrespective of whether symptoms persist or ongoing/intermittent support is needed.

Despite the multi-stakeholder relevance of these outcome domains, no comprehensive account of how to measure them is available. To fill this gap, we provide here an overview of the main tools to assess functioning, quality of life/well-being/life satisfaction, and personal recovery outcomes across mental disorders in adults. We aim to also identify additional needs that should be addressed. We identified tools that can be used in clinical and research practice to assess people with the following mental disorders.

### Oppositional defiant and conduct disorder: A review of the past 10 years, part I [^113jRp2a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

To review empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented.

Evidence supports a distinction between the symptoms of ODD and many symptoms of CD, but there is controversy about whether aggressive symptoms should be considered part of ODD or CD. CD is clearly heterogeneous, but further research is needed regarding the most useful subtypes. Some progress has been made in documenting sex differences. Symptoms that are more serious, more atypical for the child's sex, or more age-atypical appear to be prognostic of serious dysfunction.

Progress has been made in the methods for the assessment of ODD and CD. However, some critical issues, such as combining information from different informants, remain to be addressed. A proportion of children with ODD later develop CD, and a proportion of those with CD later meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder. ODD and CD frequently co-occur with other psychiatric conditions.

Although major advances in the study of the prevalence and course of ODD and CD have occurred in the past decade, some key issues remain unanswered.

### Clinical staging and the differential risks for clinical and functional outcomes in young people presenting for youth mental health care [^1124XJoJ]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

At baseline, individuals at later clinical stages were more likely to be older (F(2,2093) = 73.91; P < 0.001) and functionally impaired, as indicated by higher NEET rates (χ²(2) = 83.47; P < 0.001) and SOFAS scores (F(2,2082) = 162.50; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the proportion of those with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (χ²(2) = 0.50; P = 0.78), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (χ²(2) = 2.89; P = 0.24), or other physical illnesses (χ²(2) = 6.64; P = 0.04) across the staging groups.

Later clinical stages were associated with higher rates of manic-like experiences (χ²(2) = 172.46; P < 0.001), psychotic-like experiences (χ²(2) = 190.91; P < 0.001), and circadian disturbances (χ²(2) = 94.96; P < 0.001). Stage 1a exhibited lower rates of alcohol and/or substance misuse compared to stage 1b (χ²(1) = 32.82; P < 0.001) and stage 2+ (χ²(1) = 46.44; P < 0.001). However, no further information was available for alcohol misuse in subsequent stages.

### DSM-5: A collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^111o85qX]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Other significant changes include the incorporation of criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), which will influence the field of child psychiatry. This change has occurred in reaction to discordance between putative child and adult bipolar populations with respect to clinical presentation, treatment response, and prognostic factors, as well as the growing risk of overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder in childhood. However, longitudinal studies suggest that DMDD has poor diagnostic reliability and cannot be differentiated adequately from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. Furthermore, it is not associated with current, future-onset, or parental history of mood or anxiety disorders, confirming the utility of the revision.

Removal of the bereavement exclusion for a depressive diagnosis is arguably the most contentious 'loss' to the field of mood disorders. Early studies suggested that after bereavement, depressive syndromes are common but transient, and do not require treatment. Based on research studies published since 2006, Zisook and colleagues argued persuasively that depression related to bereavement, which occurs in the context of bereavement, is no different phenomenologically from depression in other contexts. It has similar genetic and familial patterns, comorbidities, course, outcome, and treatment response. Hence, the bereavement exclusion was itself excluded from DSM-5. This has been critiqued, and several potential advantages and disadvantages that are likely to ensue have been identified. The key argument is that DSM does not meaningfully distinguish…

### Long-term sickness absence due to adjustment disorder [^112KrrDf]. Occupational medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although adjustment disorder is frequently reported in clinical settings, scientific evidence is scarce regarding its impact on sickness absence and the variables associated with sickness absence duration. The aim of this study is to report sickness absence duration and to identify predictors of long-term sickness absence in patients with adjustment disorder.

- **Methods**: This observational, prospective study included subjects with non-work-related sickness absence (> 15 days) following a diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the best predictors of long-term sickness absence (≥ 6 months).

- **Results**: There were 1182 subjects in the final analysis. The median duration of sickness absence due to adjustment disorder was 91 days. Twenty-two percent of the subjects reported long-term sickness absence. After multivariate analysis, comorbidity (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.43–3.49), age (25–34 years old versus < 25 years old: OR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.27–6.07; 35–44 years old versus < 25 years old: OR = 3.70, 95% CI 1.71–7.99; 45–54 years old versus < 25 years old: OR = 3.58, 95% CI 1.60–8.02; ≥ 55 years old versus < 25 years old: OR = 6.35, 95% CI 2.64–15.31), and occupational level (blue collar versus white collar: OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.10–2.09) remained significantly associated with long-term sickness absence. Comorbidity was the strongest predictor.

- **Conclusions**: It is possible to predict long-term sickness absence due to adjustment disorder based on demographic, work-related, and clinical information available during the basic assessment.

### Substance use disorders: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10) [^111G3HkU]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

The aims of this study involve two major nomenclatures, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), and the International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10). These currently define substance use disorders for broad audiences with varying training, experience, and interests. A comparison of these definitions and their implications for DSM-V and ICD-11 has not been available.

- **Methods**: The background for the dependence concept and issues such as abuse, harmful use, withdrawal, substance-induced disorders, remission, and other substance-related conditions are reviewed. Reliability evidence is presented along with validity evidence from approaches including psychometric, genetic, and animal studies. The relevance of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 is compared to alternative systems such as the Addiction Severity Index.

- **Results**: Evidence for reliability and psychometric validity for substance dependence is consistently strong, though mixed for abuse and harmful use. Findings on the genetics of alcohol disorders support the validity of the dependence concept, while animal studies emphasize the importance of continued use despite negative consequences as central to the concept of dependence. Although few studies on substance-induced disorders have been conducted, those published demonstrate good reliability and validity when elements of DSM-IV and ICD-10 are combined.

- **Conclusions**: The dependence criterion in DSM-V and ICD-11 should be retained with standardized criteria sets and an added severity measure. The consequences of heavy use should be measured independently of dependence; cannabis withdrawal should be added.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116XYQVH]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly concerning screening for comorbid conditions, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend assessing for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including:

- **Emotional or behavioral conditions**: Anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, and substance use.
- **Developmental conditions**: Learning and language disorders, and autism spectrum disorders.
- **Physical conditions**: Tics and sleep apnea.
