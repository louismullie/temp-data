## Question

What does the evidence say about using baclofen in people with seizure disorders? And is there a safer muscle relaxer for people with seizures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether baclofen is safe to use in people with seizure disorders and, if it isn't, what muscle relaxants might be safer alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baclofen's mechanism of action and its potential effects on neuronal excitability. Then, I should verify regulatory warnings and labeling language about seizures. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence linking baclofen to seizure worsening or precipitation. After that, I need to consider special contexts such as intrathecal therapy, withdrawal, overdose, and interactions. Finally, I will evaluate alternative muscle relaxants with comparative safety data and synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic context. Baclofen is a centrally acting GABA-B receptor agonist that inhibits spinal reflexes, but GABA-B signaling has complex effects across excitatory and inhibitory circuits and has long been implicated in seizure disorders, with concerns that agonism may shift excitatory/inhibitory balance in ways that could be epileptogenic in some contexts [^111cN7jJ] [^111s7Thi] [^116hoxbN].

> I need to check regulatory labeling for explicit cautions. Multiple FDA labels advise caution with baclofen in patients with seizure disorders, and several note occasional deterioration in seizure control or EEG during therapy. Importantly, abrupt withdrawal can precipitate seizures, and overdose is also associated with seizures, which underscores mechanistic plausibility for seizure risk even outside labeled withdrawal scenarios [^111s7Thi] [^112SPuux] [^116MkrpC] [^1115kDs2] [^113RW65M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the clinical evidence base. Small clinical series and case reports describe seizure exacerbation or new-onset seizures in some patients exposed to baclofen, including children with cerebral palsy, whereas an older small study in adults with epilepsy suggested no clear increase in seizures in controlled patients but acknowledged uncertainty and highlighted confounding. This leaves a signal that is concerning but heterogeneous in quality and generalizability [^1145B1kz] [^113e6cGp] [^117NcDEk].

> Let me consider the clinical contexts that amplify risk. Intrathecal baclofen withdrawal can trigger refractory seizures and is a neurocritical emergency. Baclofen overdose can provoke seizures and profound CNS depression. And interactions with other CNS depressants may indirectly destabilize seizure control, so I should confirm that these scenarios warrant heightened vigilance in patients with epilepsy [^1123rNyf] [^114SU7Nh] [^113RW65M] [^11592HkM] [^112RRJMH].

> Next, I should review alternatives and their comparative safety. Tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, has signals of lower neuropsychiatric risk than baclofen in older adults, including lower risks of injury, delirium, and encephalopathy, and it lacks the specific seizure warnings seen with baclofen; dantrolene acts peripherally and may be less sedating, though it carries risks of muscle weakness and rare hepatotoxicity; benzodiazepines can reduce spasticity but add sedation and dependence risks and are not preferred for chronic spasticity management in some guidelines, so I need to ensure the choice matches indication and comorbidity profile [^112Kq7sg] [^111u4DaQ] [^1119b23y] [^113jKonH].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of comparative evidence. Systematic reviews suggest baclofen and tizanidine have broadly similar efficacy for spasticity, but comparative safety data increasingly favor tizanidine over baclofen in older adults, and guideline bodies list tizanidine among reasonable options for spasticity in MS while advising caution with benzodiazepines. This supports choosing tizanidine when seizure risk is a concern, while individualizing based on hepatic function and CYP1A2 interactions [^115buLq2] [^111U9w9d] [^111caYm8] [^111u4DaQ].

> I should double-check practical prescribing considerations. If a muscle relaxant is necessary in a patient with epilepsy, tizanidine is a reasonable first-line alternative to baclofen, with attention to hepatic and renal function, avoidance of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, and slow titration; dantrolene can be considered when sedation must be minimized, recognizing weakness and monitoring LFTs; if baclofen is already in place and effective, continuation may be acceptable with close seizure monitoring, but abrupt discontinuation must be avoided to prevent withdrawal seizures, and any taper should be gradual with contingency planning for breakthrough seizures [^111u4DaQ] [^1119b23y] [^112SPuux] [^116MkrpC].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation aligns with risk–benefit and evidence quality. Given regulatory cautions, mechanistic plausibility, and mixed but concerning clinical signals, baclofen should generally be avoided in patients with poorly controlled or unstable epilepsy. If used, it should be with informed consent, baseline and periodic EEG when indicated, avoidance of abrupt withdrawal, and a low threshold to switch to alternatives. Tizanidine is the preferred alternative in many cases based on comparable efficacy and a more favorable neuropsychiatric and seizure-related safety profile in observational data, with dantrolene or carefully selected benzodiazepines reserved for specific indications and monitored closely [^111s7Thi] [^112Kq7sg] [^111U9w9d] [^1119b23y].

---

Baclofen is **not absolutely contraindicated** in patients with seizure disorders, but it should be used with caution due to rare reports of seizure exacerbation and the risk of seizures with abrupt withdrawal [^111s7Thi] [^112SPuux]. If baclofen is used, monitor seizure control closely and taper slowly to avoid withdrawal seizures [^112SPuux] [^117XTijr]. Tizanidine is a **safer alternative** with fewer neuropsychiatric adverse effects and no clear seizure exacerbation signal, though it can cause sedation and hypotension; start low and titrate cautiously, especially in older adults or those with hepatic impairment [^111u4DaQ] [^112Kq7sg]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of any muscle relaxant in patients with seizures.

## Evidence regarding baclofen use in patients with seizure disorders

- **Seizure risk**: Baclofen is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders, but caution is advised due to rare reports of seizure exacerbation or new-onset seizures, particularly with abrupt withdrawal or overdose [^111s7Thi] [^112SPuux].

- **Withdrawal seizures**: Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen can precipitate withdrawal seizures, a well-documented risk that necessitates gradual dose tapering [^112SPuux] [^117XTijr].

- **Clinical studies**: A small study in patients with epilepsy found no significant increase in seizure frequency with baclofen, but the sample size was limited and the evidence is inconclusive [^113e6cGp].

- **FDA warnings**: The FDA labeling for baclofen advises caution in patients with seizure disorders and emphasizes the risk of seizures with abrupt withdrawal [^111s7Thi] [^112SPuux].

---

## Safer muscle relaxant alternatives

Among alternatives, **tizanidine** is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with fewer neuropsychiatric adverse effects than baclofen and no clear signal for seizure exacerbation; however, it can cause sedation and hypotension, so use caution — especially in older adults or those with hepatic impairment [^111u4DaQ] [^112Kq7sg]. Dantrolene acts peripherally at the muscle fiber and is less likely to affect seizure threshold, but it can cause muscle weakness and, rarely, hepatotoxicity; monitor liver function during therapy [^1119b23y]. Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) have anticonvulsant properties and may be beneficial for patients with coexisting seizures, but they carry risks of sedation, dependence, and withdrawal seizures with abrupt discontinuation [^114sneYm].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Use baclofen cautiously in patients with seizure disorders, preferably in those with well-controlled seizures and no history of baclofen-related adverse effects.

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor seizure control and adjust antiepileptic therapy as needed during baclofen treatment.

- **Dose tapering**: Gradually taper baclofen to minimize the risk of withdrawal seizures [^112SPuux] [^117XTijr].

- **Alternative agents**: Consider tizanidine or dantrolene as safer alternatives, particularly in patients with poorly controlled seizures or those at higher risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects [^111u4DaQ] [^1119b23y].

## Summary of evidence

| **Attribute** | **Baclofen** | **Tizanidine** | **Dantrolene** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Seizure risk | Rare exacerbation; withdrawal seizures | Lower seizure risk; sedation/hypotension | Lower seizure risk; hepatotoxicity |
| Clinical recommendation | Use with caution; taper slowly | Preferred alternative; monitor sedation | Alternative; monitor liver function |

---

Baclofen is **not absolutely contraindicated** in patients with seizure disorders, but caution is advised due to rare reports of seizure exacerbation and withdrawal seizures. Tizanidine and dantrolene are **safer alternatives** with lower seizure risk, and benzodiazepines may be considered in select cases.

### Baclofen (Fleqsuvy) [^116MkrpC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Adverse Reactions from Abrupt Withdrawal of FLEQSUVY

Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen, regardless of the cause, has resulted in adverse reactions that include hallucinations, seizures, high fever, altered mental status, exaggerated rebound spasticity, and muscle rigidity, that in rare cases has advanced to rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure, and death. Therefore, reduce the dosage slowly when FLEQSUVY is discontinued, unless the clinical situation justifies a rapid withdrawal.

5.2 Neonatal Withdrawal Symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms in neonates whose mothers were treated with oral baclofen throughout pregnancy have been reported starting hours to days after delivery. The symptoms of withdrawal in these infants have included increased muscle tone, tremor, jitteriness, and seizure. If the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus and FLEQSUVY is continued during pregnancy, gradually reduce the dosage and discontinue FLEQSUVY before delivery. If slow withdrawal is not feasible, advise the parents or caregivers of the exposed neonate of the potential for neonatal withdrawal.

5.3 Drowsiness and Sedation

Drowsiness and sedation have been reported in up to 63% of patients taking baclofen, the active ingredient in FLEQSUVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should avoid operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness when starting FLEQSUVY or increasing the dose until they know how the drug affects them.

Advise patients that the central nervous system depressant effects of FLEQSUVY may be additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants.

5.4 Poor Tolerability in Stroke Patients

FLEQSUVY should be used with caution in patients who have had a stroke. Baclofen has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerability to the drug.

5.5 Exacerbation of Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, or Confusional States

FLEQSUVY should be used with caution in patients suffering from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, or confusional states. If treated with FLEQSUVY, these patients should be kept under careful surveillance because exacerbations of these conditions have been observed with oral baclofen administration.

5.6 Exacerbation of Autonomic Dysreflexia

FLEQSUVY should be used with caution in patients with a history of autonomic dysreflexia. The presence of nociceptive stimuli or abrupt withdrawal of FLEQSUVY may cause an autonomic dysreflexic episode.

### Baclofen injection (Gablofen) [^111Uiids]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Maintenance dosage for long term continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen has ranged from 12 mcg/day to 2,003 mcg/day, with most patients adequately maintained on 300 micrograms to 800 micrograms per day. There is limited experience with daily doses greater than 1,000 mcg/day. Determination of the optimal GABLOFEN dose requires individual titration. The lowest dose with an optimal response should be used.

Spasticity of Cerebral Origin Patients

The clinical goal is to maintain muscle tone as close to normal as possible and to minimize the frequency and severity of spasms to the extent possible, without inducing intolerable side effects, or to titrate the dose to the desired degree of muscle tone for optimal functions. Very often the maintenance dose needs to be adjusted during the first few months of therapy while patients adjust to changes in lifestyle due to the alleviation of spasticity.

During periodic refills of the pump, the daily dose may be increased by 5% to 20%, but no more than 20%, to maintain adequate symptom control. The daily dose may be reduced by 10% to 20% if patients experience side effects. Many patients require gradual increases in dose over time to maintain optimal response during chronic therapy. A sudden large requirement for dose escalation suggests a catheter complication (i.e., catheter kink or dislodgement).

Epilepsy impacts people of all ages, races, social classes, and geographical locations. As a chronic condition, it poses additional physical and psychological challenges for patients compared to the general population. It significantly burdens individuals and society. Patients with epilepsy commonly experience psychiatric illnesses and cognitive abnormalities alongside their condition. Notably, many ASMs can cause psychiatric side effects, such as hyperactivity and depression, and some may increase suicide risk. Moreover, ASMs can adversely affect cognitive functions, leading to difficulties in learning, driving, and memory retention. It is essential to consider these potential side effects when treating individuals with epilepsy. Various factors, including the type of seizures and the response to ASMs, impact the burden of epilepsy. According to the Global Burden of Epilepsy study in 2019, both idiopathic epilepsy and epilepsy due to other causes resulted in a global loss of 18.3 million years due to disability (YLDs), accounting for 2.1% of total global YLDs. Uncontrolled epilepsy can be disabling, leading to significant psychological and social dysfunction, reduced educational and employment opportunities, impaired quality of life, and a 2–3 times higher risk of premature death compared to the general population. Despite the increased availability of ASMs over the past 25 years, the challenge of treatment-resistant epilepsy has remained constant, highlighting the need for new and more effective treatment options.

Newer ASMs are being used to improve seizure control in patients with refractory epilepsy, defined as those who have not achieved satisfactory seizure control with two or more different ASMs. Traditional ASMs have limitations in achieving seizure freedom, which is why newer ASMs with distinct mechanisms of action are being explored. These newer ASMs are designed to target various processes involved in seizure development, such as blocking sodium or calcium channels, activating potassium channels, enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity, and inhibiting excitatory amino acids. However, studies have shown that using two traditional ASMs together does not benefit patients with refractory epilepsy. As a result, adding newer ASMs to the treatment regimen has become standard practice for these patients. Recently, several newer ASMs with better safety profiles have been introduced. These aim to improve seizure control, particularly for patients with refractory epilepsy. Examples include rufinamide (RUF), brivaracetam (BRV), cenobamate (CNB), eslicarbazepine (ESL), lacosamide (LCM), retigabine (RTG), and perampanel (PER).

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^11747j9S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a distressing and life-threatening condition that usually affects people who are alcohol dependent when they discontinue or decrease their alcohol consumption. Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe AWS in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and last updated in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to June 2019: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 189 randomised participants (one RCT new for this update). None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes of alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcohol withdrawal delirium, or craving. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores in eight-hour periods from days one to five (very low-quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam (2 studies, 85 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in change from baseline to days 10 to 15 on CIWA-Ar scores (very low-quality evidence, meta-analysis was not performed due to insufficient data). In one study (37 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in participants with at least one adverse event (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide (1 study, 60 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in difference from baseline to nine-day decremental fixed-dose intervention: CIWA-Ar scores (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; very low-quality evidence), global improvement (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23; very low-quality evidence), 14/60 participants with adverse events (RD 2.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 7.10; very low-quality of evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low-quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low-quality evidence). None of the RCTs provided information on random sequence generation or allocation concealment, therefore, we assessed them at unclear risk of bias. Two RCTs were not of double-blind design and had a high risk of bias in blinding (Addolorato 2006; Girish 2016). One RCT had more than 5% dropouts with high risk of attrition bias (Lyon 2011). We could not assess reporting bias as none of the prepublished protocols were available.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low-quality evidence.

### Muscle relaxants for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis [^117DLgSv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management is a high priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium).

Search Methods

We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety.

Main Results

Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95% CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95% CI 2 to 11).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) do not appear to be beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.

### Safety of baclofen and tizanidine in older adults: a retrospective cohort study in a large integrated health care system [^115HEzmN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The AGS 2023 updated Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults recommends avoidance of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) for musculoskeletal complaints. Two SMRs, baclofen and tizanidine, are excluded from this criterion. Clinicians may therefore consider baclofen or tizanidine as options for older adult patients with musculoskeletal complaints; however, evidence for this conclusion is lacking.

Purpose

To investigate injury events associated with baclofen and tizanidine in older adults compared to cyclobenzaprine, an SMR included in the Beers Criteria.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) in patients age 65 to 99years. Participants were identified as KPSC members dispensed a study SMR between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Serious injury events were identified in the electronic medical record using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for the following: fracture, fall leading to fracture, brain injury, and dislocation injury. Findings were adjusted for numerous demographic and clinical covariates. Secondary analyses investigated injury-free probabilities based on the type of injury event.

Results

From a population of 87,896 participants, 118,426 study medication episodes were identified. Compared with cyclobenzaprine, baclofen demonstrated a 69% greater risk (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.51–1.88), and tizanidine carried a 34% greater risk (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11–1.62) for composite injury outcomes. Both baclofen and tizanidine demonstrated lower injury-free probabilities over time when compared with cyclobenzaprine.

Conclusions

Older adult patients dispensed baclofen or tizanidine were found to have an increased risk of injury when compared with cyclobenzaprine, currently included on the Beers Criteria. These findings support the inclusion of baclofen and tizanidine on the Beers Criteria along with other SMRs as potentially inappropriate medications in use in older adults with musculoskeletal complaints. Due to a retrospective design, the risk for residual confounding may remain.

### Baclofen injection (Gablofen) [^1115kDs2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy are potentially at risk for withdrawal. Early symptoms of baclofen withdrawal may include return of baseline spasticity, pruritus, hypotension, and paresthesias. Some clinical characteristics of the advanced intrathecal baclofen withdrawal syndrome may resemble autonomic dysreflexia, infection (sepsis), malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic-malignant syndrome, or other conditions associated with a hypermetabolic state or widespread rhabdomyolysis.

Rapid, accurate diagnosis and treatment in an emergency-room or intensive-care setting are important in order to prevent the potentially life-threatening central nervous system and systemic effects of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal. The suggested treatment for intrathecal baclofen withdrawal is the restoration of intrathecal baclofen at or near the same dosage as before therapy was interrupted. However, if restoration of intrathecal delivery is delayed, treatment with GABA-ergic agonist drugs such as oral or enteral baclofen, or oral, enteral, or intravenous benzodiazepines may prevent potentially fatal sequelae. Oral or enteral baclofen alone should not be relied upon to halt the progression of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal.

Seizures have been reported during overdose and with withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen as well as in patients maintained on therapeutic doses of intrathecal baclofen.

5.6 Possible Exacerbation of Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, or Confusional States

Patients suffering from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, or confusional states should be treated cautiously with GABLOFEN and kept under careful surveillance, because exacerbations of these conditions have been observed with oral administration.

### EAN guideline on palliative care of people with severe, progressive multiple sclerosis [^111U9w9d]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for muscle cramps, more specifically with respect to patients with multiple sclerosis (management of spasticity, skeletal muscle relaxants), EAN 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering oral or intrathecal baclofen,
tizanidine,
and GABAergic drugs to reduce spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis, taking into account the presence of other symptoms and possible adverse events.

### An unusual presentation of baclofen overdose [^1116pybz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Baclofen has become increasingly popular in the treatment of spasticity disorders. Its availability for misuse has also increased. We report a case of baclofen overdose in a 20-year-old man, who manifested atypical symptoms of baclofen overdose — that is, delirium and rhabdomyolysis. He was treated successfully with full supportive management, and was discharged from the hospital on the 12th day following admission. If a past medication history is not immediately available, baclofen overdose should be included in the differential diagnosis of an acutely confused patient complicated with rhabdomyolysis, as routine toxicology screening does not include baclofen.

### Baclofen overdose with unique cardiovascular effects [^113yfuAo]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Baclofen overdose by ingestion is relatively uncommon, and measurement of serum baclofen levels may take days to weeks. Thus, oral baclofen overdose is often diagnosed clinically rather than objectively.

### Effect of intrathecal baclofen on pain and quality of life in poststroke spasticity [^114WMeBb]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Requests to access the data set from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to Medtronic at. All analytic methods have been provided with the published article.

Study Design and Participants

SISTERS was a phase 4, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study conducted in rehabilitation hospitals at 11 centers across Europe (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and Slovenia) and 7 centers in the United States between December 16, 2009, and September 21, 2016. The study was approved by the institutional review board/ethics committee and competent authorities (Europe only) at each participating site/country. Patients or their legal guardian provided written informed consent before study participation.

Full details on the design of SISTERS, including the sample size calculation and randomization methods, have been reported previously. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ITB therapy compared with CMM with oral antispastic medications on severe spasticity in poststroke patients after 6 months active treatment. For the purposes of this study, a stroke was defined as any acute vascular accident (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Key eligibility criteria included age 18 to 75 years, poststroke duration > 6 months, and spasticity in at least 2 extremities and an Ashworth Scale score of ≥ 3 in at least 2 affected muscle groups in the lower extremities. Patients were excluded if they had known baclofen hypersensitivity, uncontrolled refractory epilepsy, systemic infection, cardiac pacemaker or other implantable device, or use of botulinum toxin within the 4 months before study start. The full list of study inclusion/exclusion criteria is provided in the(Table I in the).

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ITB therapy or CMM via an interactive web-based system and according to a computer-generated sequence, stratified by clusters of centers via the block permutation method (randomly selected block sizes of 2 or 4).

Dantrolene — oral antispasticity option with muscle-level action and dosing limitations: Dantrolene is the only medication that acts at the muscular level and can be less sedating than diazepam or baclofen; however, adverse effects that should be considered are muscle weakness including diaphragmatic and accessory respiratory muscle weakness. The stability of dantrolene in a suspension form is short, dosing from opened capsules is unreliable if not a full capsule, and this drug typically needs to be administered four times a day, so compliance can be an issue.

### Bacolfen [^111LmAiM]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

### Baclofen and botulinum toxin A use in tone management for children with cerebral palsy: a review of current literature and research gaps in pre-and perioperative care [^11679Kkr]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of motor disability in children. Many children with CP have hypertonia, and some will require orthopedic surgery. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A), a muscle relaxant, is commonly pre- or perioperatively injected to improve surgical outcomes and reduce postoperative pain and muscle tone. However, inconsistent evidence supporting its efficacy, potential research bias from industry sponsorship, and numerous adverse effects, such as long-term changes to muscle morphology, highlight the need for a better alternative. Preoperatively increasing the dose of oral baclofen, a first-line treatment for generalized CP-related hypertonia, may improve surgical outcomes with fewer long-term adverse effects. To date, the impact of an increased oral baclofen dose for this purpose has not yet been studied. This article reviews the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of the three more commonly used antispastic treatments, BoNT-A, oral baclofen, and intrathecal baclofen, with the goal of trialing increased oral baclofen dose as an adjunct to surgery.

Events Observed during the Pre- and Post-marketing Evaluation of Intrathecal Baclofen

Adverse events associated with the use of intrathecal baclofen reflect experience gained with 576 patients followed prospectively in the United States. They received intrathecal baclofen for periods of one day (screening) (N = 576) to over eight years (maintenance) (N = 10). The usual screening bolus dose administered prior to pump implantation in these studies was typically 50 mcg. The maintenance dose ranged from 12 mcg to 2,003 mcg per day. Because of the open, uncontrolled nature of the experience, a causal linkage between events observed and the administration of intrathecal baclofen cannot be reliably assessed in many cases and many of the adverse reactions reported are known to occur in association with the underlying conditions being treated. Nonetheless, many of the more commonly reported reactions — hypotonia, somnolence, dizziness, paresthesia, nausea/vomiting and headache — appear clearly drug-related.

Adverse experiences reported during all U.S. studies (both controlled and uncontrolled) are shown in Table 1. Eight of 474 patients who received chronic infusion via implanted pumps had adverse experiences which led to a discontinuation of long term treatment in the pre- and post-marketing studies.

Results

Brief Summary of Prescribing Information

Dosage and Administration

The recommended starting dose of tizanidine is 2 mg. Treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 h intervals as needed. The dose of tizanidine can be gradually increased by 2–4 mg per dose, with intervals of 1–4 days between each increase, until a satisfactory reduction in muscle tone is achieved. When discontinuing tizanidine, the dose should be slowly reduced to minimize the risk of discontinuation and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency or any hepatic impairment.

Drug–Drug Interactions

Coadministration of tizanidine with cytochrome P450 enzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Other CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided in combination with tizanidine due to potential drug interactions that may increase the risk of hypotension and sedation. Sedation can be additive when patients take tizanidine with another CNS depressant (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants), so clinicians should monitor symptoms of excessive sedation.

Adverse Drug Reactions

Adverse effects of tizanidine include somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, hallucinations, abnormal liver function, and hepatotoxicity.

Safety of Tizanidine versus Other SMRs

Table 1 lists a summary of the comparative safety studies of SMRs.

Table 1
Summary of Comparative Safety Studies of Skeletal Muscle Relaxants

Injury and Delirium

A retrospective cohort study showed that older adults newly initiated with baclofen had a significantly higher risk of injury and delirium compared to those who started on tizanidine for musculoskeletal pain (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.54, 3.33, respectively, P ≤ 0.001).

Encephalopathy

In a cohort that included 16,192 new baclofen users and 9782 new tizanidine users, oral baclofen was found to be associated with a higher 30-day risk of encephalopathy compared with tizanidine [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 2.29].

### Neurological evolution of severe baclofen intoxication: from brain death mimic to recovered brain function [^11592HkM]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This case study highlights the detailed clinical course and detailed continuous EEG monitoring of a severe baclofen intoxication over time which initially mimicked brain death clinically for 6 hours and presented with an initial burst-suppression EEG pattern which resolved within 10 hours during continuous monitoring. Our case report describes the first hours of the clinical evolution of neurological symptoms including the initial clinical picture of brain death and the continuous improvement of consciousness and brain stem reflexes.

Baclofen is a centrally acting muscle relaxant to primarily treat spasticity. It acts as an agonist for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptors expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system. Common side effects of baclofen include dizziness, sleepiness and autonomous dysfunction, including accommodative dysfunction, hypotonia, nausea, frequent urination and hyperhydrosis. In mild cases of baclofen intoxication, patients may be lethargic, confused or somnolent. A daily dose of more than 200 mg may lead to more severe symptoms, such as hypotension or severe hypertension, bradycardia and bradypnoea. Baclofen intoxication may also provoke epileptic seizures. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms may involve hyperpolarisation of inhibitory neurons through excess GABAB receptor activity resulting in a reduced seizure threshold. The treatment of baclofen toxicity is supportive and mainly involves respiratory and circulatory support and treatment of seizures until resolution of symptoms. Previously, case reports of baclofen intoxication with loss of brainstem reflexes and an EEG burst-suppression pattern have been reported. Similar to our case, other reports also demonstrated normalisation of EEG findings by repeated EEG exams, however, without cEEG. This case report adds to the existing literature a detailed description of the clinical course and cEEG over the first hours after hospitalisation.

### Baclofen — baclofen — intrathecal [^116evo1d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Strict aseptic technique in filling is required to avoid bacterial contamination and serious infection. A period of observation appropriate to the clinical situation should follow each refill or manipulation of the drug reservoir.

Extreme caution must be used when filling an FDA approved implantable pump equipped with an injection port that allows direct access to the intrathecal catheter. Direct injection into the catheter through the catheter access port may cause a life-threatening overdose.

Additional considerations pertaining to dosage adjustment: It may be important to titrate the dose to maintain some degree of muscle tone and allow occasional spasms to: 1) help support circulatory function, 2) possibly prevent the formation of deep vein thrombosis, 3) optimize activities of daily living and ease of care.

Except in overdose related emergencies, the dose of baclofen injection (intrathecal) should ordinarily be reduced slowly if the drug is discontinued for any reason.

An attempt should be made to discontinue concomitant oral antispasticity medication to avoid possible overdose or adverse drug interactions, either prior to screening or following implant and initiation of chronic baclofen injection (intrathecal) infusion. Reduction and discontinuation of oral anti-spasmotics should be done slowly and with careful monitoring by the physician. Abrupt reduction or discontinuation of concomitant antispastics should be avoided.

### Dexmedetomidine for acute baclofen withdrawal [^116Xbj21]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intrathecal baclofen is widely accepted as a treatment option for severe spasticity through its γ-Aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) agonist properties. Abrupt cessation can lead to severe and life-threatening withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, autonomic dysreflexia, rigidity, and seizures. This symptomatic presentation is similar to alcohol withdrawal, which is mediated by modification of GABAA expression. Use of the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine for the treatment of ethanol withdrawal has been widely reported, raising the question of its potential role in baclofen withdrawal. We present a case of the successful treatment of acute severe baclofen withdrawal with a dexmedetomidine infusion.

Methods

A 15-year-old patient with spastic quadriparesis and cerebral palsy underwent unexpected removal of his baclofen pump due to an infection that was encountered during a planned pump revision. Following removal, he was placed on high dose enteral baclofen every 6 h. Despite further benzodiazepine supplementation, he had progressive hemodynamic instability, severe rebound spasticity, and intermittent spontaneous clonus consistent with baclofen withdrawal. A dexmedetomidine infusion was titrated to a peak dose of 16 mcg per hour with successful treatment of withdrawal symptoms.

Results

The patient became normotensive without tachycardia. Tone and agitation improved.

Conclusion

Dexmedetomidine is to our knowledge a previously unreported option for treatment of acute severe baclofen withdrawal. We report a case of safe and efficacious use in a patient with spastic quadriparesis on chronic intrathecal baclofen. Scientifically rigorous comparison with other options remains to be performed.

Events Observed during the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Intrathecal Baclofen

Adverse events associated with the use of intrathecal baclofen reflect experience gained with a total of 211 U.S. patients with spasticity of cerebral origin, of whom 112 were pediatric patients (under age 16 at enrollment). They received intrathecal baclofen for periods of one day (screening) (N = 211) to 84 months (maintenance) (N = 1). The usual screening bolus dose administered prior to pump implantation in these studies was 50 mcg to 75 mcg. The maintenance dose ranged from 22 mcg to 1,400 mcg per day. Doses used in this patient population for long-term infusion are generally lower than those required for patients with spasticity of spinal cord origin.

Because of the open, uncontrolled nature of the experience, a causal linkage between events observed and the administration of intrathecal baclofen cannot be reliably assessed in many cases. Nonetheless, many of the more commonly reported reactions — somnolence, dizziness, headache, nausea, hypotension, hypotonia and coma — appear clearly drug-related.

The most frequent (≥ 1%) adverse reactions reported during all clinical trials are shown in Table 2. Nine patients discontinued long term treatment due to adverse reactions.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review [^115buLq2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are a heterogeneous group of medications used to treat two different types of underlying conditions: spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes and muscular pain or spasms from peripheral musculoskeletal conditions. Although widely used for these indications, there appear to be gaps in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety of different skeletal muscle relaxants. This systematic review summarizes and assesses the evidence for the comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions. Randomized trials (for comparative efficacy and adverse events) and observational studies (for adverse events only) that included oral medications classified as skeletal muscle relaxants by the FDA were sought using electronic databases, reference lists, and pharmaceutical company submissions. Searches were performed through January 2003. The validity of each included study was assessed using a data abstraction form and predefined criteria. An overall grade was allocated for the body of evidence for each key question. A total of 101 randomized trials were included in this review. No randomized trial was rated good quality, and there was little evidence of rigorous adverse event assessment in included trials or observational studies. There is fair evidence that baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene are effective compared to placebo in patients with spasticity (primarily multiple sclerosis). There is fair evidence that baclofen and tizanidine are roughly equivalent for efficacy in patients with spasticity, but insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of dantrolene compared to baclofen or tizanidine. There is fair evidence that although the overall rate of adverse effects between tizanidine and baclofen is similar, tizanidine is associated with more dry mouth and baclofen with more weakness. There is fair evidence that cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine, and tizanidine are effective compared to placebo in patients with musculoskeletal conditions (primarily acute back or neck pain). Cyclobenzaprine has been evaluated in the most clinical trials and has consistently been found to be effective. There is very limited or inconsistent data regarding the effectiveness of metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, baclofen, or dantrolene compared to placebo in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relative efficacy or safety of cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine, tizanidine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, and chlorzoxazone. Dantrolene, and to a lesser degree chlorzoxazone, have been associated with rare serious hepatotoxicity.

### Tizanidine: advances in pharmacology&therapeutics and drug formulations [^116kJ14X]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) are widely used in treating musculoskeletal conditions. All SMRs, with the exception of baclofen and tizanidine, are on the list of 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria ® for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults. In our geriatric practice, off-label use of tizanidine as preemptive analgesia drove us to find recent advances in its pharmacology and therapeutics. An update review of tizanidine was thus presented, aiming to bring the latest knowledge to clinicians and promote further research and practical exploration.

Methods

Relevant literature up to December 2023 was identified through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase.

Results

Tizanidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist with both antispastic and antispasmodic activity, shows efficacy in the common indications for all SMRs. From the perspective of drug safety, tizanidine has lower incidences of adverse events (injury, delirium, encephalopathy, falls, and opioid overdose) compared to baclofen, no association with risk of Alzheimer's disease as with orphenadrine, no risk of serotonin syndrome like metaxalone when comedicated with serotonergic drugs, no significant pharmacokinetic changes in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers unlike diazepam and carisoprodol, and no physically addictive or abuse properties like carisoprodol and diazepam. From the perspective of new and potential therapeutic uses, tizanidine has additional benefits (eg, gastroprotection that can improve patient tolerance to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-neuropathic pain, a key component of multimodal analgesia strategy to reduce early postoperative pain, and anti-tumor effects). New delivery systems of tizanidine are developing to improve the pharmacokinetics of oral products, including buccal patches, transdermal delivery systems, nasal spray, and in situ rectal gel.

Conclusion

Tizanidine is an SMR with unique features and may be an optimal initial choice for older adults. There would be more scientific studies, wider therapeutic applications, and new drug formulations in the future.

### Abrupt withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen: recognition and management of a potentially life-threatening syndrome [^114SU7Nh]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To suggest guidelines for the prevention, recognition, and management of a life-threatening syndrome (high fever, altered mental status, profound muscular rigidity that sometimes progressed to fatal rhabdomyolysis) in patients who experience the abrupt withdrawal of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy.

Design

Retrospective literature and safety-file review.

Setting

Expert panel drawn from physiatry, neurology, and neurosurgery.

Participants

Experienced users of ITB therapy in the pediatric and adult populations in the United States.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

We reviewed literature reports, MedWatch reports to the US Food and Drug Administration, and our own experiences. We critically analyzed patient management and drug therapy in the context of the pharmacology of baclofen and other antispastic agents.

Results

An abrupt reduction in gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA) agonist activity in the central nervous system can cause the ITB withdrawal syndrome, which is clinically and pathophysiologically distinct from autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, and neuroleptic-malignant syndrome. ITB withdrawal evolves over 1 to 3 days, but may become fulminant if not recognized and treated early. The syndrome can be interrupted by the restoration of ITB therapy. However, supportive measures and high-dose benzodiazepine infusion may be life saving in the interval before ITB therapy is resumed. Dantrolene infusion may relieve muscle rigidity but does not reverse the other manifestations of GABAergic agonist withdrawal.

Conclusions

Most episodes of severe ITB withdrawal were preventable. Patients at risk can be identified and educated prospectively and given medication for emergency use. Treatment with GABAergic agonist drugs may prevent potentially fatal sequelae.

### Safety of baclofen versus tizanidine for older adults with musculoskeletal pain [^112Kq7sg]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Baclofen and tizanidine are both muscle relaxants that carry the risk for neuropsychiatric events in older adults but there is a lack of data directly comparing their safety. This study aimed to investigate the relative risk between these two medications in causing injury and delirium in older adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study that was completed in an integrated healthcare system in the United States and included patients aged 65years or older who started baclofen or tizanidine for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain from January 2016 through December 2018. Outcomes included new incidence of injury (concussion, contusion, dislocation, fall, fracture, or other injuries) and delirium. The cohort was followed from the initiation of therapy until the first occurrence of any of the following events: end of the index drug exposure, end of health plan membership, death, or the study end date of December 31st, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to compare baseline patient characteristics between baclofen and tizanidine treatment groups. Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

The final study cohort included 12,101 and 6,027 older adults in the baclofen and tizanidine group respectively (mean age 72.2 ± 6.2years old, 59% female). Older adults newly started on baclofen had a greater risk of injury (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.21–1.96, P = < 0.001) and delirium (HR = 3.33, 95% CI = 2.11–5.26, p = < 0.001) compared to those started on tizanidine.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that baclofen is associated with higher incidences of injury and delirium compared to tizanidine when used for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. Future studies should investigate if these risks are dose-related and include a comparison group not exposed to either drug.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^111otPfA]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Table 4 — Most commonly used oral medications in spasticity treatment — baclofen dosing and key cautions are as follows: Children have dosing roughly based on body weight with a typical starting dose of 2.5–5 mg/day, titrated up every few days to a maximum dose of 20 to 60 mg/ day; adults begin approximately 5 mg orally two to three times a day and may be slowly titrated to the recommended maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Reported adverse effects include drowsiness/sedation, weakness, constipation, confusion, hypotonia and ataxia, and sudden withdrawal of the drug may lead to seizures and hallucinations; adverse effects that are intolerable may preclude increasing the dose to the desired level to achieve maximum reduction in spasticity. Additional notes state that a GABA-B agonist is adept at reducing spasticity regardless of the source, it does not cross the blood–brain barrier easily and may make it challenging to achieve a desired concentration at the site of action without titrating the dose up quite a bit, and the use of oral baclofen in neonates with spasticity is not well documented.

24-hour period. No dose increases should be given in the first 24 hours (i.e., until the steady state is achieved). In most patients, it will be necessary to increase the dose gradually over time to maintain effectiveness; a sudden requirement for substantial dose escalation typically indicates a catheter complication (i.e., catheter kink or dislodgement).

Adult Patients with Spasticity of Spinal Cord Origin

After the first 24 hours, for adult patients, the daily dosage should be increased slowly by 10% to 30% increments and only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved.

Adult Patients with Spasticity of Cerebral Origin

After the first 24 hours, the daily dose should be increased slowly by 5% to 15% only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved.

Pediatric Patients

After the first 24 hours, the daily dose should be increased slowly by 5% to 15% only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved. If there is not a substantive clinical response to increases in the daily dose, check for proper pump function and catheter patency. Patients must be monitored closely in a fully equipped and staffed environment during the screening phase and dose-titration period immediately following implant. Resuscitative equipment should be immediately available for use in case of life-threatening or intolerable side effects.

Paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome ("dysautonomia", "sympathetic storm") after traumatic brain injury presents with hypertension, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, tachypnea, or diaphoresis and can be treated with beta blockers (BBKs), benzodiazepines, opioids, alpha-2 agonists, gabapentin, muscle relaxants, and baclofen. Low-quality data suggest that BBKs are associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe TBI who experience paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome, propranolol has the most evidence to support its use for these indications, and monitoring for BBK adverse effects is essential as these effects could be detrimental in the acute period post-TBI.

In order to identify a starting dose, we extrapolated from the literature dosing ratios of systemic versus intrathecal (IT) or intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) drug administration for conditions other than epilepsy. There was considerable variation between the dose administered systemically and intrathecally or ICV, with intrathecal concentration ranges between 1/500th and 1/10th of systemic dose. Further, based on data in Appendix V and VI, as well as previous experience with ICV morphine and baclofen chemotherapy, we created a schedule for increasing ICV doses from 1/400th of the oral dose in the standard range of valproate, monitored by careful observation for potential side effects, gradually to a dose of up to 1/10th of the oral dose of valproate. The starting dose was based on pre-clinical data, clinically established CSF valproic acid levels from oral and IV administration as well as extrapolating from the experience with intrathecal morphine and baclofen delivery.

The ICV valproate dose was initially escalated stepwise through Day 50, if tolerated or stopped earlier upon establishment of a subject's maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation is described in detail in Table 1. After the initial escalation, subjects were then further escalated stepwise from 60 mg/day up to 160 mg/day. The devices were refilled at varying intervals according to the dose escalation and response, but all were maintained on approximately monthly cycles of refills when optimal doses were reached.

Drug titration schedule.

Both the subjects and the assessing physician remained blinded to the treatment dose during the Blinded Evaluation Period. Subjects were able to continue in an open-label evaluation period for 52 weeks following the Blinded Evaluation Period. Subjects who completed the Open-Label Evaluation Period and responded well to treatment were able to continue in the Open-Label Extension Period for up to two years (approximately 104 weeks).

The primary safety outcomes were measured via the serious adverse event (SAE) rate. Safety was also assessed via adverse events, vital signs, physical exams, changes in concomitant medications, use of rescue medications, neuropsychological testing, and laboratory tests.

The primary efficacy outcome was measurement of change in the number of seizures. Efficacy was also assessed via seizure type and severity from seizure diary data, measured EEG readings, use of rescue medication, neuropsychological testing, and decrease in oral ASD use.

Statistical analysis

Given the small number of subjects it was not considered appropriate or practical to perform statistical analysis.

### Polysomnographic analysis of a pediatric case of baclofen-induced central sleep apnea [^113LFBbp]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Respiratory disorders may follow brain injury and may also occur because of comorbidities and drug use, especially central depressants or muscle relaxants. Sleep can precipitate respiratory disorders, thus polysomnography can be a powerful diagnostic tool. By revealing breathing patterns that identify specific sleep disorders, polysomnography may unmask adverse pharmacological effects, for instance connecting central depressant drugs with central sleep apneas. We describe the case of a pediatric patient in rehabilitation from brain injury who developed a central sleep apnea following a baclofen dose increase within the therapeutic range, while assuming an under-dosed benzodiazepine. Polysomnography identified a typical respiration pattern, previously observed in adults treated with baclofen and other central depressants. Baclofen tapering resolved the central sleep apnea. Polysomnography, and this specific pattern, may be proposed as diagnostic tools in patients with high dose baclofen that can be used to prevent potential respiratory disorders in children.

Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Baclofen (oral) — spasticity treatment in children with cerebral palsy (CP): There is conflicting Class II evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral baclofen in reducing spasticity and improving function in children with CP, and there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral baclofen for the treatment of spasticity or to improve motor function in children with CP (Level U); baclofen is widely used in clinical practice, and experts recommend starting baclofen at the lowest possible dose (5–10 mg/day) to minimize adverse events (AEs), with gradual tapering because abrupt discontinuation may cause withdrawal symptoms including increased spasticity, hallucinations, confusion, hyperthermia, and seizures; in one study AEs occurred in 25% of patients on baclofen, including somnolence or sedation (20%) and hypotonia (15%) — no AEs were noted on placebo — while a second study did not find a significant difference in AEs between groups.

Prokinetics for pediatric GERD — baclofen evidence and safety: The search identified a double-blinded placebo RCT of baclofen versus placebo in children with intractable GERD symptoms, in which baclofen significantly reduced the rates of acid reflux and TLESRs and improved gastric emptying measured by breath testing, but no significant difference in the number of adverse events was found between study groups and the quality of evidence was very low. Baclofen reduces the frequency of TLESRs, reduces acid reflux and accelerates gastric emptying, but it has not been evaluated in controlled trials for treatment of GERD in children; based on adult literature review, baclofen may be useful for treatment of GERD in patients, but should not be regarded as first-choice therapy largely because of the potential side effects seen in adult studies. Safety of baclofen includes side effects such as dyspeptic symptoms, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and lowered threshold for seizures reported in adult patients.

agonist used for the treatment of spasticity), with a clinical profile well supported by more than 40 years of experience having been clinically introduced in Europe in 1966. The precise mechanisms of action of baclofen are not fully known. It inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, probably by hyperpolarization of afferent. The currently approved oral tablet dosage forms of baclofen are indicated for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis, particularly for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity. It may also be of value in patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases.

### Comparative risk of opioid overdose with concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants [^111Dfg4U]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants has been associated with opioid overdose, but little data exist on the head-to-head safety of these drug combinations. The objective of this study was to compare the risk of opioid overdose among patients on long-term opioid therapy who concurrently initiate skeletal muscle relaxants.

Methods

We conducted an active comparator cohort study spanning 2000 to 2019 using healthcare utilization data from 4 US commercial and public insurance databases. Individuals were required to have at least 180 days of continuous enrollment and at least 90 days of continuous prescription opioid use immediately before and on the date of skeletal muscle relaxant initiation. Exposures were the concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, and the main outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) and bootstrapped 95% CI of opioid overdose resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization. The primary analysis quantified opioid overdose risk across 7 prescription opioid-skeletal muscle relaxant therapies and a negative control outcome (sepsis) to assess potential confounding by unmeasured illicit opioid use. Secondary analyses evaluated two-group and five-group comparisons in patients with similar baseline characteristics; individuals without previous recorded substance abuse; and subgroups stratified by baseline opioid dosage, benzodiazepine codispensing, and oxycodone or hydrocodone use.

Results

Weighted HR of opioid overdose relative to cyclobenzaprine was 2.52 (95% CI 1.29–4.90) for baclofen; 1.64 (95% CI 0.81–3.34) for carisoprodol; 1.14 (95% CI 0.53–2.46) for chlorzoxazone/orphenadrine; 0.46 (95% CI 0.17–1.24) for metaxalone; 1.00 (95% CI 0.45–2.20) for methocarbamol; and 1.07 (95% CI 0.49–2.33) for tizanidine in the 30-day intention-to-treat analysis. Findings were similar in the as-treated analysis, 2-group and 5-group comparisons, and patients without previous recorded substance abuse. None of the therapies relative to cyclobenzaprine were associated with sepsis, and no subgroups indicated an increased risk of opioid overdose.

Discussion

Concomitant use of prescription opioids and baclofen relative to cyclobenzaprine is associated with opioid overdose. Clinical interventions may focus on prescribing alternatives in the same drug class or providing access to opioid antagonists if treatment with both medications is necessary for pain management.

### Risk of opioid overdose associated with concomitant use of opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants: a population-based cohort study [^111u7BPx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The recent opioid prescribing guideline cautions about the concomitant prescribing of opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) given the additive central nervous system depressant effect. However, the clinical relevance remains unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the risk of opioid overdose associated with concomitant use of opioids and SMRs vs. opioid use alone. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74–1.62) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00–1.58) in the incident and prevalent opioid user cohorts, respectively, generating a combined estimate of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.00–1.48). This risk seemed to increase with treatment duration (≤ 14 days: 0.91 and 95% CI, 0.67–1.22; 15–60 days: 1.37 and 95% CI, 0.81–2.37; > 60 days: 1.80 and 95% CI, 1.30–2.48) and for baclofen (1.83 and 95% CI, 1.11–3.04) and carisoprodol (1.84 and 95% CI, 1.34–2.54). Concomitant users with daily opioid dose ≥ 50 mg (1.50 and 95% CI, 1.18–1.92) and benzodiazepine use (1.39 and 95% CI, 1.08–1.79) also had elevated risk. Clinicians should be cautious about these potentially unsafe practices to optimize pain care and improve patient safety.

### Intrathecal baclofen therapy versus conventional medical management for severe poststroke spasticity: results from a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label trial (SISTERS) [^114djLcs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

SISTERS was a randomised, controlled, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, phase IV study conducted in rehabilitation hospitals at 11 European centres (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Slovenia) and 7 US centres. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01032239).

Patients

Potential participants were identified by the study team during clinic visits and by searching hospital patient databases. Eligible patients were men or women aged 18–75 years with a poststroke duration > 6 months and generalised spasticity, who had not reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions (eg, physiotherapy, botulinum toxin injection and oral medication). All patients had spasticity in at least two extremities and an Ashworth Scale (AS) score ≥ 3 in a minimum of two muscle groups of the lower extremities (LE) on the affected body side. Exclusion criteria were: known baclofen sensitivity; uncontrolled refractory epilepsy; active systemic infection; presence of a cardiac pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, implantable neurostimulator, or drug delivery device; use of oral vitamin K antagonists; use of botulinum toxin within the 4 months prior to inclusion; and inability/unwillingness of the patient/family to participate in long-term ITB therapy management. Chemodenervation (including botulinum toxin) and surgery affecting limb mobility were prohibited during the study. All patients (or legal guardian) provided written informed consent before study participation.

Randomisation

Using an interactive web-based randomisation system, we assigned patients (1:1) to ITB therapy or CMM according to a computer-generated sequence prepared by Medtronic. Randomisation was stratified by 'clusters of centres' via the block permutation method employing randomly selected blocks of sizes 2 or 4. Clusters were established by grouping centres with similar patient type (low-level or high-level functional patients (LLP or HLP); see table 1 for definition) and country standards of care.

Table 1
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (ITT population)

Due to the nature of the treatments, the study was not blinded to the investigator or patient. To avoid AS score assessment bias and inter-rater variability, all AS scores (except for those during the ITB test) were performed by the same blinded assessor.

Investigations

Given the limited information on arrival to the emergency department, an initial diagnosis of a postictal comatose state after a suspected tonic-clonic seizure was made, and 2 g levetiracetam was administered intravenously. Due to sustained deep coma and bradypnoea, the patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation while being sedated with propofol before obtaining a multimodal contrast-enhanced head CT scan, which revealed no signs of cerebral ischaemia, haemorrhage, arterial occlusion or brain perfusion alterations. The patient was then transferred to our intensive care unit for further treatment.

Initial routine laboratory values, including complete blood cell count, electrolytes, serum pH, troponin, C reactive protein, hepatic, thyroid and renal functional tests, were within normal limits. Urine toxicological screening was negative for the tested agents. Sedation with propofol was stopped after the effect of muscle relaxant given for intubation wore off (as monitored by the repetitive 'train of four' stimulation). The clinical examination now revealed a GCS of 3 and absent brainstem reflexes with loss of gag and cough reflex, loss of pupillary reflex and apnoea without any rigour, neck stiffness or motor symptoms. Figure 1 outlines the evolution of neurological symptoms within the first 96 hours after admission. A cEEG was started 3 hours after admission and initially showed a spontaneous burst-suppression pattern, which was unaltered after rapid administration of 0.5 mg flumazenil (figure 2A). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated normal cell counts and protein levels with negative results for common neurotropic pathogens according to multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Special attention must be given to recognizing the signs and symptoms of overdosage, especially during the initial screening and dose-titration phase of treatment, but also during re-introduction of GABLOFEN after a period of interruption in therapy.

Symptoms of Intrathecal Baclofen Overdose

Drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, somnolence, respiratory depression, seizures, rostral progression of hypotonia and loss of consciousness progressing to coma of up to 72 hours duration. In most cases reported, coma was reversible without sequelae after drug was discontinued. Symptoms of intrathecal baclofen overdose were reported in a sensitive adult patient after receiving a 25 mcg intrathecal bolus.

Treatment Suggestions for Overdose

There is no specific antidote for treating overdoses of GABLOFEN; however, the following steps should ordinarily be undertaken:

1) Residual intrathecal baclofen solution should be removed from the pump as soon as possible.

2) Patients with respiratory depression should be intubated if necessary, until the drug is eliminated.

Anecdotal reports suggest that intravenous physostigmine may reverse central side effects, notably drowsiness and respiratory depression. Caution in administering physostigmine is advised, however, because its use has been associated with the induction of seizures and bradycardia.

Physostigmine Doses for Adult Patients

Administer 2 mg of physostigmine intramuscularly or intravenously at a slow controlled rate of no more than 1 mg per minute. Dosage may be repeated if life-threatening signs, such as arrhythmia, convulsions or coma occur.

Physostigmine Doses for Pediatric Patients

Administer 0.02 mg/kg physostigmine intramuscularly or intravenously, do not give more than 0.5 mg per minute. The dosage may be repeated at 5 to 10 minute intervals until a therapeutic effect is obtained or a maximum dose of 2 mg is attained.

Physostigmine may not be effective in reversing large overdoses and patients may need to be maintained with respiratory support.

If lumbar puncture is not contraindicated, consideration should be given to withdrawing 30 to 40 mL of CSF to reduce CSF baclofen concentration.

### Acute intrathecal baclofen withdrawal: a brief review of treatment options [^1123rNyf]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute baclofen toxicity and withdrawal can present with a constellation of symptoms making differentiation between these two entities and other potential diagnoses challenging. Baclofen withdrawal is associated with numerous complications which may require neurocritical care expertise such as respiratory failure, refractory seizures, delirium, and blood pressure lability.

Methods

Case report and literature review.

Results

This case report discusses a case of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) withdrawal, focusing on the differential diagnosis for acute baclofen withdrawal and reviews the various options that exist to treat the symptoms of acute baclofen withdrawal such as benzodiazepines, propofol, skeletal muscle relaxants, and tizanidine.

Conclusions

Critical care practitioners should be prepared to treat this potentially devastating and often refractory complication of ITB therapy.

### Medical treatment of dystonia [^114CzayW]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Medications such as anticholinergic drugs, dopamine modulators, baclofen, muscle relaxants, and other pharmacologic agents have been used for a long time to treat dystonia, but the introduction of botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation clearly revolutionized the symptomatic treatment of this neurological movement disorder. Therapy of dystonia can be divided into the following categories: (1) physical, supportive, and ancillary therapy; (2) pharmacologic treatment; (3) chemodenervation with botulinum toxin; and (4) peripheral and central surgery (deep brain stimulation). Except in some cases of secondary dystonia, pathogenesis-targeted or disease-modifying therapy is currently not available. This review focuses on evidence-based medical treatment of dystonia, highlighting recent advances, with emphasis on individualized approach. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### Efficacy, tolerability and safety of add-on third-generation antiseizure medications in treating focal seizures worldwide: a network meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials [^114GdSaW]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, there are several limitations to consider. Firstly, the majority of RCTs compare ASMs with placebos, with few RCTs directly comparing different ASMs. Consequently, all effect sizes between different ASMs were derived from indirect comparisons. While we have ranked all ASMs across all outcomes, these rankings should be treated with caution, underscoring the need for future head-to-head trials. Secondly, achieving seizure freedom in patients with treatment-resistant FOS is challenging, leading to a scarcity of adequate case numbers for seizure freedom in most RCTs. This scarcity may introduce bias in estimating seizure freedom outcomes. Lastly, our analysis was based on traditional NMA; future studies should incorporate individual patient data into NMA for more precise estimates in this field.

In summary, this systematic review and Bayesian NMA offer insights into the relative efficacy, tolerability, and safety of third-generation ASMs in treating patients with treatment-resistant FOS. By providing the most comprehensive current evidence base, our analysis aims to inform pharmacological treatment choices in this critical clinical area. The insights gained should assist in shaping clinical guidelines and supporting the decision-making process for patients and clinicians, facilitating the identification of the most suitable treatment strategies for treatment-resistant FOS.

Baclofen is a muscle relaxant used in both adults and children with neuromuscular disorders to control spasticity. In children, relatively few cases of overdose have been previously reported. We report two cases of baclofen overdose occurring in two siblings. One sibling with cerebral palsy was being treated with baclofen at the time of overdose. Both cases presented with severe respiratory depression requiring mechanical ventilation. Serum baclofen concentrations from both children were significantly elevated. We also review the published literature on baclofen overdose in children and adolescents. These cases emphasize the importance of warning parents about the potential toxicity of baclofen when prescribing the drug to a family member.

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^114sneYm]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discovered in the 1950s by Leo Sternbach, benzodiazepines were enthusiastically adopted as a safer alternative to barbiturates for management of insomnia and anxiety. Evidence quickly accrued, however, of substantial risk of dependence. Despite recommendation that they be prescribed for no more than four weeks, long term use remains common, with 300 000 long term users in the UK.

Benzodiazepines, and the related z drugs (zopidem, zopiclone, and zalepon), potentiate the rapid neuroinhibitory effect of the neurotransmitter γ aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain and spinal cord. This results in reduction of anxiety, induction of sleep, and muscle relaxation. Consequently, benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders, but are also highly effective as muscle relaxants; for treating epilepsy, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and acute behavioural disturbance; and as a premedicant in anaesthesia.

Patients may develop dependence after only a few weeks of regular use and many long term users experience problems on dose reduction, including rebound anxiety, nausea, perceptual changes, and, rarely, epileptic seizures and psychosis. The muscle relaxant and sedative effects of benzodiazepines increase the risk of falls, particularly in older people, while there is also association with certain infections, and with increased all cause mortality. In addition to short term amnesic effects, evidence exists of medium and longer term impact on cognition, with an increasingly strong association with dementia.

### Intrathecal baclofen in the treatment of adult spasticity [^111PP8fd]. Neurosurgical Focus (2006). Low credibility.

Medical management of adult spasticity, a condition of increased muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes, is often challenging and complex. Oral medications such as baclofen often have unacceptable supraspinal side effects at effective doses. Intrathecal baclofen delivered by an implanted catheter and pump system provides good relief of spasticity while overcoming these limitations. In this paper the authors survey the use of oral and intrathecal baclofen therapy, detail the surgical process, and explain the risks and benefits of the procedure.

### Baclofen and the risk of fall and fracture in older adults: a real-world cohort study [^116f7R9k]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The growth of oral muscle relaxant prescriptions among older adults in the United States is concerning due to the drugs' adverse sedative effects. Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist muscle relaxant that is associated with encephalopathy. We characterized the risk of fall and fracture associated with oral baclofen against other muscle relaxants (tizanidine or cyclobenzaprine) in older adults.

Methods

We designed a new-user, active-comparator study using tertiary health system data from Geisinger Health, Pennsylvania (January 2005 through December 2018). Older adults (aged ≥ 65years) newly treated with baclofen, tizanidine, or cyclobenzaprine were included. Propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance the treatment groups on 58 baseline characteristics. Fine-Gray competing risk regression was used to estimate the risk of fall and fracture.

Results

The study cohort comprised of 2205 new baclofen users, 1103 new tizanidine users, and 9708 new cyclobenzaprine users. During a median follow-up of 100days, baclofen was associated with a higher risk of fall compared to tizanidine (IPTW incidence rate, 108.4 vs. 61.9 per 1000 person-years; subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.20–2.36]). The risk of fall associated with baclofen was comparable to cyclobenzaprine (SHR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.93–1.47]) with a median follow-up of 106days. The risk of fracture was similar among patients treated with baclofen versus tizanidine (SHR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.63–1.14]) or cyclobenzaprine (SHR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.67–1.07]).

Conclusions

The risk of fall associated with baclofen was greater than tizanidine, but not compared to cyclobenzaprine in older adults. The risk of fracture was comparable among the older users of baclofen, tizanidine, and cyclobenzaprine. Our findings may inform risk-benefit considerations in the increasingly common clinical encounters where oral muscle relaxants are prescribed.

### Effect of baclofen on seizure frequency… [^117NcDEk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor — The conclusion of Terrence et al1 that baclofen in usual therapeutic doses does not seem to be epileptogenic may be based on chance observations. The epilepsy of their six controlled patients usually had a good spontaneous prognosis and was not suitable for pharmacologic treatment. One of these six patients showed a major change in seizure frequency concurrent with baclofen administration, yet previous monthly variation of seizure frequency was not described, making interpretation difficult. Furthermore, serum concentrations of the drugs were not available. The authors' data argued neither against an epileptogenic nor for an anticonvulsant action of baclofen. It may be remembered, however, that several presumably or definitely seizure-free patients were described who had epileptic phenomena while receiving baclofen. One patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, 2 and two had myoclonia in the recovery phase after baclofen overdose induced a coma.

### Effect of baclofen on seizure frequency-reply… [^116pLTF1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In Reply. — Dr Seyfert's thoughtful letter brings up an important point about previous individual case reports of baclofen and seizures, namely, that baclofen given in toxic doses is probably epileptogenic in both animals and humans. Such toxic overdose was certainly the case in the reports of Paulson, 1 Laplatte et al, 2 and Seyfert et al. 3 In the more recent article by Seyfert and Straschill, 4 the serum baclofen concentration was 850 ng/mL in a patient receiving long-term hemodialysis who was unable to excrete baclofen normally. Since a single 40-mg oral dose of baclofen will produce a peak transient baclofen blood level of about 650 ng/mL, 5 attainment of a relatively constant serum concentration of 850 ng/mL in a patient with normal kidney function would take a daily dose of at least three to four times the manufacturer's recommended maximum daily dose of 80 mg.

### Oral baclofen in cerebral palsy: possible seizure potentiation? [^1145B1kz]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, is widely used to treat spasticity of cerebral and spinal origin. Patients with both acute baclofen overdose and withdrawal have developed seizures. After several reports of new-onset seizures in children treated with oral baclofen at our institution, we reviewed our experience regarding possible effects of baclofen on seizure induction in a childhood movement disorders program over a 2-year period. Of 54 children (ages 1–10) treated with oral baclofen, 19 (35%) had a prior history of seizures. Five children (14%) developed new-onset seizures after starting baclofen. Although epilepsy is very common in children with cerebral palsy, these findings raise the possibility that baclofen may potentiate seizures in certain young children with cerebral palsy. Further study of the effects of baclofen on seizures is warranted.

Protocol Deviations

We deviated from protocol to adjust for finding fewer relevant studies and fewer cases of treatment-emergent movement disorders than expected. As such, we pooled all movement disorders as a single outcome instead of assessing each type of movement disorder individually. Additionally, it was also not feasible to assess for publication bias, and we did not perform meta-regression to understand movement disorder risk as a function of number of concomitant antiseizure medications, epilepsy syndrome or seizure etiology, age, risk of bias, and quality of adverse drug event content. We performed a subanalysis for the risk of included antiseizure medications on movement disorders only among children with epilepsy. We also analyzed the primary outcome by risk difference instead of prevalence to better account for any increased risk of movement disorders compared to placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^112tkVyM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a very serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Pharmacological treatments presently used are of uncertain effectiveness and there is even more doubt on the comparative effects and value for money.

Objectives

To summarize Cochrane reviews that assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (30 November 2010). Two authors independently screened, extracted data, summarised key characteristics of the included reviews and assessed their quality using AMSTAR; the quality of the evidence was summarised according to the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Five reviews, 114 studies, 7333 participants, satisfied criteria for inclusions. The outcomes considered were alcohol withdrawal seizures, adverse events and dropouts. Comparing the five treatments with placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, three studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.69), moderate quality of evidence. Comparing each of the five treatments versus specific class of drugs, benzodiazepines performed better than antipsychotics for seizures, 4 studies, 633 participants, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) high quality of the evidence. Comparing different benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants among themselves, 28 comparisons, results never reached statistical significance but chlordiazepoxide performed better. The quality of evidence was high for 3% of the results, moderate for 28%, low for 48% and very low for 20%.

Authors' Conclusions

Among the treatments considered, benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against seizures, when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines were possible, because of the heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and in the assessment of outcomes. Data on potential harms are sparse and fragmented. Results do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS, but anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects. There is also not enough evidence of effectiveness and safety of baclofen, because only one study consider this treatment and of GHB for which no strong differences were observed in the comparisons with placebo, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants.

5.1 Adverse Reactions
from Abrupt Withdrawal of LYVISPAH

Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen, regardless of the cause, has resulted in adverse reactions that include hallucinations, seizures, high fever, altered mental status, exaggerated rebound spasticity, and muscle rigidity, that in rare cases has advanced to rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure, and death. Therefore, reduce the dosage slowly when LYVISPAH is discontinued, unless the clinical situation justifies a rapid withdrawal.

5.2 Neonatal Withdrawal Symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms in neonates whose mothers were treated with oral baclofen throughout pregnancy have been reported starting hours to days after delivery. The symptoms of withdrawal in these infants have included increased muscle tone, tremor, jitteriness, and seizure. If the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus and LYVISPAH is continued during pregnancy, gradually reduce the dosage, and discontinue LYVISPAH before delivery. If slow withdrawal is not feasible, advise the parents or caregivers of the exposed neonate of the potential for neonatal withdrawal.

5.3 Drowsiness and Sedation

Drowsiness and sedation have been reported in up to 63% of patients taking baclofen, the active ingredient in LYVISPAH [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should avoid operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness when starting LYVISPAH or increasing the dosage until they know how the drug affects them. Advise patients that the central nervous system depressant effects of LYVISPAH may be an additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants.

5.4 Poor Tolerability in Stroke Patients

LYVISPAH should be used with caution in patients who have had a stroke. Baclofen has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerability to the drug.

5.5 Exacerbation of Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, or Confusional States

LYVISPAH should be used with caution in patients suffering from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, or confusional states. If treated with LYVISPAH, these patients should be kept under careful surveillance because exacerbations of these conditions have been observed with oral baclofen administration.

5.6 Exacerbation of Autonomic Dysreflexia

LYVISPAH should be used with caution in patients with a history of autonomic dysreflexia. The presence of nociceptive stimuli or abrupt withdrawal of LYVISPAH may cause an autonomic dysreflexic episode.

### Long-term oral baclofen treatment in a child with cerebral palsy: electroencephalographic changes and clinical adverse effects [^113TK82S]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Baclofen is widely used to control spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Several publications described clinical adverse effects of baclofen oral treatment, but the effect of baclofen on seizure potentiation is still controversial. We describe a 10-year-old female patient with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and mental retardation who developed clinical adverse effects (confusion, agitated state, insomnia, diffuse hypotonia, and hyporeflexia) and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes (quasiperiodic, generalized burst of sharp waves that take up > 50% of standard EEG) during long-term oral baclofen treatment, after gradually increasing the dosage but still within the therapeutic dose. Our case showed clearly that the EEG changes in our patient, with a history of epilepsy in good control, have been induced by the baclofen increase, and we describe the possible mechanisms that could explain proconvulsive effect of baclofen.

Muscle cramps — muscle relaxants, dosing, and short‑term outcomes: Muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, have all demonstrated efficacy in short‑term trials of patients with cirrhosis; baclofen (30 mg/d) led to at least partial resolution in 92% of users after 3 months and can be started at 10 mg daily with a weekly increase of 10 mg/d up to a maximum daily dose of 30 mg (10 mg three times a day). Methocarbamol decreased frequency and duration of cramps in 100 patients with hepatitis C–related cirrhosis with minor side effects of dry mouth and drowsiness, and orphenadrine improved muscle spasms after 4 weeks of treatment; however, the long‑term effectiveness of these agents requires further evaluation.

### Baclofen [^116hoxbN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The precise mechanism of action of baclofen is not fully known. Baclofen is capable of inhibiting both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, possibly by hyperpolarization of afferent terminals, although actions at supraspinal sites may also occur and contribute to its clinical effect. Although baclofen is an analog of the putative inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), there is no conclusive evidence that actions on GABA systems are involved in the production of its clinical effects. In studies with animals baclofen has been shown to have general CNS depressant properties as indicated by the production of sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Baclofen is rapidly and extensively absorbed and eliminated. Absorption may be dose-dependent, being reduced with increasing doses. Baclofen is excreted primarily by the kidney in unchanged form and there is relatively large intersubject variation in absorption and/or elimination.

### Phylogenetic divergence of GABAreceptor signaling in neocortical networks over adult life [^111cN7jJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The role of GABA B Rs contributing to human brain health and pathology

GABAergic neurotransmission has long been linked to the onset and development of seizure disorders, albeit the role of ionotropic GABA A Rs displays complex and paradoxical effects on seizure propagation, with many anti-seizure medications targeting these receptors and GABA release. GABA B Rs have received much less attention as potential therapeutic targets for seizures, due to the fact that the agonist baclofen can exacerbate seizures, and antagonists have bidirectional effects. This complexity is likely due to potent GABA B R signalling in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons alike, leading to shifts in excitatory/inhibitory balance that may produce complex circuit effects (reviewed in Kulik, et al.).

GABA B Rs themselves have long been implicated in seizure disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), where expression of receptor subunits has been suggested to be elevated in post-mortem human brain, but with impaired function in neurons recorded from the seizure focus. This is mimicked in rodent models of TLE, where rapid loss of GABA B R subunits was observed in the dorsal hippocampus. Our data does not address whether GABA B Rs are lost following seizures, however, we show that in patients who have received LEV functional GABA B R currents are elevated, irrespective of seizure history. The mechanism by which LEV mediates long-term suppression of seizures is not fully understood. It is known that it directly binds to Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2A (SV2A), which is present in axon terminals of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and may be strongly expressed in basket cell axon terminals. Indeed, administration of LEV leads to increased GABA levels in the brain, which agrees with a central role at GABAergic synapses. The mechanisms by which LEV leads to elevated GABA B R currents remain to be determined. However, this is likely a specific effect, as previous studies of GABA A R signalling in resected human brain tissue did not observe an effect on ionotropic currents. The ability to regulate endogenous GABA B R functional currents represents a unique and promising avenue for the development of future anti-seizure medications, which may lack many of the deleterious side effects of LEV. Intriguingly, we observed that baclofen did not produce more pronounced effects on neuronal oscillations in LEV-only patients. This may reflect a compensation to altered GABA release probability that has yet to be identified, or indeed that the effects of baclofen on post-synaptic membranes are saturating at the concentrations used in our study. The absence of an altered response to 2 μM baclofen indicates that presynaptic GABA B R function may be unaffected in LEV patients. This may indicate that effects on GABA B R signalling are confined to postsynaptic membranes of excitatory neurons, and not inhibitory interneurons, but this requires further investigation.

### Antiseizure medications for preventing a first seizure in adults with a brain tumour [^114LNY4m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of outcome measures

Studies should investigate the number of participants in a treatment group experiencing a first seizure (Primary outcomes) for inclusion, to ensure relevance to the review objectives. Given the variable duration of studies, we will consider any time points, but will group these into short term (< 30 days) and long term (> 30 days).

Primary outcomes

The primary outcome is the number of participants in a treatment group experiencing a first seizure within the study period, as a proportion of the total number of participants in that treatment group.

Secondary outcomes

Adverse events (as reported in the included studies) at any time after the introduction of treatment: the proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events in relation to ASM therapy; where possible, we will include additional information on whether any were graded as serious adverse events and by what criteria.
Health‐related quality of life (QoL) scales
Proportion of participants who died within the study period

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We will search the following databases.

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
MEDLINE (Ovid), using the search strategy shown in Appendix 1
Embase (Ovid)

We will search all databases from their inception to current date, without language restrictions.

Additionally, we will search the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to ensure that we capture trials not yet on the CENTRAL database.

Searching other resources

To identify further references, we will review the reference lists of all included primary studies. Where required, we will contact experts in the field for information on any ongoing or unpublished trial data.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two review authors (MAM and AB) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of all articles identified in the search to select potentially relevant studies for inclusion. They will retrieve the full‐text articles for potentially relevant studies. The two review authors (MAM and AB) will then review the full texts and record the reasons for articles excluded at this stage. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion, or by consensus with a third review author if required (GM). The review authors will identify and exclude any duplicate articles, and collate multiple reports from the same trial, to enable an overview of the true number of studies included, rather than the number of reports.

Review authors will record the selection process in detail, including reasons for the exclusion of articles, and produce a PRISMA flow diagram to describe the selection process (PRISMA 2020).

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

OCT2 Inhibitors: Concomitant use may cause an increased exposure and potential risk of seizures (7.1)

7.1 OCT2 Inhibitors

Concurrent treatment with OCT2 inhibitors, such as cimetidine, may cause increased exposure to dalfampridine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elevated levels of dalfampridine increase the risk of seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. The potential benefits of taking OCT2 inhibitors concurrently with dalfampridine should be considered against the risk of seizures in these patients.

### Baclofen and tizanidine adverse effects observed among community-dwelling adults above the age of 50 years: a systematic review [^111Jzjp2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review highlights adverse effects of baclofen and tizanidine in older community-dwelling adults.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted, including search terms of "adverse effect", "baclofen", "elderly", "falls", "fractures", and "tizanidine". Studies were included if they described community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older who received oral baclofen or tizanidine. The Federal Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data were compiled for adverse effect incidence.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The literature search was completed in July 2019 and updated in June 2023. Reviews performed by 2 independent reviewers yielded 15 records. FAERS identified 486 (baclofen) and 305 (tizanidine) adverse effects of interest.

Data Synthesis

Two retrospective cohort studies evaluating baclofen use in older adults showed increased hospitalizations for encephalopathy in chronic kidney disease (7.2% vs 0.1%) and end-stage renal disease (daily dose 20 mg or more; relative risk [RR] 19.8, 95% CI = [14.0–28.0]). Other articles were case reports; 10 articles reported dyskinesias, encephalopathy or disorientation, and drowsiness associated with baclofen, and 5 articles reported bradycardia and/or hypotension with tizanidine. The FAERS Public Dashboard revealed 12.1% and 28.7% overall incidence of adverse effects of interest, with a 27.8% and 29.2% incidence of falls for baclofen and tizanidine, respectively. Baclofen and tizanidine are associated with concerning adverse effects in older adults. Alternative agents should be considered, but, if necessary, providers should start at lower doses and increase slowly.

Conclusions

This review highlights the importance of using baclofen and tizanidine with caution in older adults.

### Baclofen [^111s7Thi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness. Patients should also be cautioned that the central nervous system effects of baclofen may be additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants.

Baclofen should be used with caution where spasticity is utilized to sustain upright posture and balance in locomotion or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function.

In patients with epilepsy, the clinical state and electroencephalogram should be monitored at regular intervals, since deterioration in seizure control and EEG have been reported occasionally in patients taking baclofen.

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk.

A dose-related increase in incidence of ovarian cysts and a less marked increase in enlarged and/or hemorrhagic adrenal glands was observed in female rats treated chronically with baclofen.

Ovarian cysts have been found by palpation in about 4% of the multiple sclerosis patients that were treated with baclofen for up to one year. In most cases these cysts disappeared spontaneously while patients continued to receive the drug. Ovarian cysts are estimated to occur spontaneously in approximately 1% to 5% of the normal female population.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

### Severe central sleep apnea associated with Chronic baclofen therapy: a case series [^115GqckK]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-B agonist with muscle-relaxant properties, is widely used in patients with severe spasticity. In animals, baclofen has been shown to decrease respiratory drive. In humans, however, use of baclofen at the standard dose did not significantly impair sleep-disordered breathing in a susceptible population of snorers. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of baclofen for the treatment of alcohol dependence. We describe severe central sleep apnea (CSA) in four patients with none of the conditions commonly associated with CSA who were receiving chronic baclofen therapy for alcohol withdrawal. In one patient, baclofen withdrawal was associated with a complete resolution of CSA. Three patients were treated by adaptive servo-ventilation while continuing their treatment with baclofen. Given the increasing number of patients receiving baclofen for alcohol withdrawal treatment, physicians should be aware that these patients might be affected by severe CSA. Future studies are required to determine the mechanisms, prevalence, and treatment modalities of sleep-disordered breathing associated with baclofen usage.
