## Question

pt with hypothyroid on levothyroxine 75 mg with TSH at 10 what should next steps be

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next steps for a patient with hypothyroidism who is currently taking levothyroxine 75 mcg daily and has a TSH of 10 mIU/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this represents undertreatment or treatment failure. Then, I should verify adherence and absorption issues. Next, I will review dose-adjustment strategy and timing of labs. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities. Finally, I will outline monitoring, formulation issues, and when to escalate or refer, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and whether this TSH reflects undertreatment. A TSH of 10 mIU/L in a patient on levothyroxine is above the typical treatment target of 0.5–3.5 or 4.0 mIU/L, indicating insufficient replacement or nonadherence/absorption problems, and warrants prompt evaluation and dose optimization to avoid ongoing hypothyroid symptoms and cardiometabolic risks [^07a7b05d] [^32fb5434].

> Wait, let me verify adherence and administration before changing the dose. I should ask about pill-taking habits, timing relative to meals, and coadministered medications or supplements that impair absorption (calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, bile acid sequestrants, soy, coffee), and I should confirm whether the patient uses the same brand consistently, because switches can alter bioavailability and TSH. If adherence is uncertain, a supervised trial or weekly dosing can help distinguish nonadherence from malabsorption [^4c28da6c] [^1b98ef38] [^8938c0c8].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of dose adjustment. Standard practice is to increase levothyroxine by 12.5–25 mcg increments and recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks. Given a TSH of 10 mIU/L, a reasonable step is to increase to 100 mcg daily if there are no contraindications, with a plan to reassess in 4–6 weeks and titrate to a TSH around 0.5–3.5 mIU/L, avoiding overshooting into suppression [^07a7b05d] [^32fb5434].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and comorbidities. In older adults or those with coronary artery disease, I should start low and titrate slowly to avoid ischemia. In pregnancy, I should immediately increase the total weekly dose by about 30% and monitor TSH every 4 weeks to trimester-specific targets. In central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable, so I must target free T4 in the upper half of normal instead of TSH [^95d0aac6] [^1be19404] [^318324c9].

> Let me consider formulation and absorption next. If repeated TSH elevations persist despite seemingly adequate dosing and confirmed adherence, I should consider switching to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulation, which can improve absorption and stabilize TSH, and I should counsel on consistent administration timing (fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal) to minimize variability [^af64cc26] [^d211728c] [^3a9edc59].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and targets. After any dose change, I will recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks, then every 6–12 months once stable, and I will individualize the TSH target by age and comorbidity, recognizing that older adults may tolerate a slightly higher TSH and that aiming for the lower tertile of normal does not consistently improve quality of life in controlled studies [^07a7b05d] [^ff11340f] [^32fb5434].

> But wait, what if the required dose exceeds physiologic expectations? If the patient needs more than about 1.5–1.7 mcg/kg/day (or 1.8–2.0 mcg/kg/day after thyroidectomy) to normalize TSH, I should double-check for pseudomalabsorption, drug–drug interactions, or celiac disease, and consider a supervised absorption test or a trial of liquid/softgel formulation before escalating further [^6039e75a] [^af64cc26].

> I should confirm that I am not missing central hypothyroidism. If free T4 is low with inappropriately normal or low TSH, or if there are pituitary symptoms or prior pituitary disease, I must manage to a free T4 target rather than TSH and coordinate endocrine evaluation for other pituitary axes [^318324c9] [^6bf11f69].

> Let me reconsider the role of combination therapy. If the patient remains symptomatic despite a TSH in the reference range and other causes have been excluded, a carefully monitored, time-limited trial of liothyronine added to levothyroxine may be considered in select cases, but most RCTs do not show benefit and this should not be first-line or used in pregnancy [^b2c45664] [^2f047d02].

> Putting this together, my immediate next steps are: confirm adherence and administration technique, check for interfering medications or supplements, and increase levothyroxine by 25 mcg to 100 mcg daily if no contraindications, with a plan to recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks. If TSH remains elevated despite confirmed adherence, switch to liquid or softgel levothyroxine and reassess absorption, and if the required dose remains disproportionately high, evaluate for malabsorption or central causes and refer as needed [^07a7b05d] [^af64cc26] [^6039e75a].

---

The next step is to **increase levothyroxine to 100 mcg daily** and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^07a7b05d] [^40f61ce6]. A TSH of 10 mIU/L on 75 mcg indicates undertreatment, and guidelines support 12.5–25 mcg dose increments every 4–6 weeks until TSH is normalized [^07a7b05d]. If TSH remains elevated after adherence and absorption are confirmed, consider switching to a liquid or softgel formulation [^af64cc26] or checking for interfering drugs or malabsorption [^4c28da6c] [^6039e75a].

---

## Step 1: confirm adherence and absorption

Before changing the dose, **confirm adherence and absorption**:

- **Adherence**: Ask about missed doses, timing with food, and consistency [^80fb55bf].

- **Administration**: Ensure levothyroxine is taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal [^3a9edc59] [^5bb589b0].

- **Interactions**: Review for calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, cholestyramine, or soy that reduce absorption [^4c28da6c].

- **Formulation**: Consider liquid or softgel if absorption issues persist [^af64cc26] [^d211728c].

---

## Step 2: dose adjustment

If adherence and absorption are adequate, **increase the dose**:

- **Increment**: Increase by 12.5–25 mcg (typically 25 mcg) to 100 mcg daily [^07a7b05d].

- **Timing**: Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks after the change [^40f61ce6].

- **Target**: Aim for TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, adjusting in 12.5–25 mcg steps until normalized [^07a7b05d] [^32fb5434].

---

## Step 3: evaluate persistent elevation

If TSH remains elevated after confirming adherence and absorption, **evaluate further**:

- **Formulation switch**: Try liquid or softgel at the same dose [^af64cc26] [^d211728c].

- **Malabsorption**: Consider celiac disease, Helicobacter pylori, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Reassess for new or ongoing interfering medications [^4c28da6c].

- **Rare causes**: Evaluate for pseudomalabsorption or TSH assay interference [^notfound].

---

## Step 4: special considerations

Tailor management to **patient-specific factors**:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Titrate more slowly and monitor for angina or arrhythmias [^07a7b05d].

- **Elderly**: Use conservative dosing and consider higher TSH targets in patients > 70 years [^95d0aac6] [^ff11340f].

- **Pregnancy**: Increase dose by 30% immediately and monitor TSH every 4 weeks [^1be19404] [^39b8b1c0].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm adherence and absorption | Ensure the current dose is being taken and absorbed correctly [^80fb55bf] [^4c28da6c] |
| 2 | Increase dose by 25 mcg to 100 mcg daily | Standard incremental approach to undertreatment [^07a7b05d] |
| 3 | Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks | Allow steady-state and accurate assessment [^40f61ce6] |
| 4 | If TSH remains elevated, evaluate for malabsorption or interference | Identify and correct reversible causes [^af64cc26] [^6039e75a] |
| 5 | Adjust dose in 12.5–25 mcg increments until TSH normalizes | Gradual titration to avoid overtreatment [^07a7b05d] |

---

The next step is to **increase levothyroxine to 100 mcg daily** and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks, addressing adherence and absorption first. If TSH remains high, switch formulation or evaluate for malabsorption or drug interactions [^07a7b05d] [^af64cc26].

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^cc6ebde5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

ASCO endocrine toxicities — primary hypothyroidism during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy is managed by grade and monitored with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Grade 1 defined as TSH > 4.5 and < 10 mIU/L and asymptomatic should continue ICPI with monitoring every 4–6 weeks. Grade 2 with moderate symptoms or TSH persistently > 10 mIU/L may continue or hold ICPI until symptoms resolve to baseline; prescribe thyroid hormone supplementation in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with TSH levels that persist over 10 mIU/L (measured 4 weeks apart), monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks while titrating, and once adequately treated, repeat testing every 6–12 months. For grade 3–4 severe symptoms, hold ICPI until symptoms resolve to baseline; if there is uncertainty about whether primary or central hypothyroidism is present, hydrocortisone should be given before thyroid hormone is initiated. Additional considerations include estimating full replacement at approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/d for patients without risk factors, starting at 25–50 μg in older or frail patients, and recognizing that recovery after thyroiditis may occur within 3–4 weeks.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, at the current time hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States, and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value at which therapy is initiated has decreased over time.– This trend for increasing treatment and decreasing thresholds has been documented both in the United States, and in Europe. Moreover, a recent study showed that if LT4 therapy was discontinued in patients undergoing treatment, while 39% of patients did in fact become hypothyroid as manifest by an elevated TSH, 61% maintained a normal TSH, perhaps suggesting that their treatment was unnecessary. However, the follow-up period in this study was relatively brief at 6–8 weeks, thus hypothyroidism being manifest later during follow-up cannot be excluded. Although national databases show a trend for an increasing number of LT4 prescriptions being provided over time, part of this apparent increase may be accounted for by a reduction in the length of prescriptions by prescribers, such that more prescriptions are being generated for the same number of patients each year.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to adjust the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving QoL or modulating body weight, as they are not useful.

### Levothyroxine treatment of mild subclinical hypothyroidism: a review of potential risks and benefits [^bcbb7288]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4). SCH is further classified into a milder condition with TSH levels between 4.0 and 10.0 milli-international units (mIU)/l (mild-SCH) and a severe form with TSH > 10.0 mIU/l (severe-SCH). SCH is a common problem (prevalence is greater in women than men), which increases further with increasing age and TSH levels. Even though the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism is higher in patients with severe-SCH, the risk is also significant in patients having mild-SCH; it has been suggested that every twofold rise in serum TSH would increase the risk from 1 to 4%, which further increases to 38% if thyroid antibodies are positive. Current data have shown increased cardiovascular risk in patients with mild-SCH and have demonstrated some benefits of levothyroxine treatment in reducing these events. However, evidence on the association of mild-SCH and musculoskeletal system, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and goitre is conflicting. Similarly, the discussion regarding the exact upper limit of normal for serum TSH remains controversial. The data have also shown increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patient with mild-SCH, with some benefits of thyroxine treatment. The recent available guidelines related to management of patients with serum TSH < 10 mIU/l have suggested decisions should be made taking into account the age of the patient, associated risk factors and comorbid conditions. This chronicle review assesses current evidence regarding the risks associated and the recommendations related to benefits of levothyroxine treatment in patients having mild-SCH.

Regarding medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy (choice of agent and dosing), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider starting levothyroxine in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism at generally lower doses (25–75 mcg/day depending on the degree of TSH elevation) than required in the treatment of overt hypothyroidism. Guide further adjustments by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations including TSH values.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^1f5b3bab]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening (myxedema coma); more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e., take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management. Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated.

Inadequate levothyroxine — harms and treatment goal: "The adverse effects of thyroid hormone deficiency include detrimental effects on the serum lipid profile and progression of cardiovascular disease. We recommend that patients with overt hypothyroidism be treated with doses of levothyroxine that are adequate to normalize serum thyrotropin levels, in order to reduce or eliminate these undesirable effects. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence".

Levothyroxine dosage — starting dose determinants: When deciding on a starting dose of levothyroxine, the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and general clinical context, including the presence of cardiac disease, should all be considered, and the serum thyrotropin goal appropriate for the clinical situation should also be considered. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

Symptoms and TSH in levothyroxine-treated patients — In levothyroxine (LT4) users, a cross-sectional analysis of 697 patients taking LT4 showed a correlation between higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and more hypothyroid symptoms, even within the subset of 43 patients who were overtly euthyroid; however, another cross-sectional study did not find a relationship between well-being and TSH categories of less than and greater than 2 mIU/L, and a randomized, controlled cross-over trial of three LT4 dose targets reported no differences in the major outcomes of patient preference. A nonrandomized open-label study noted symptomatic improvement on an LT4 dose 50 μg higher than the optimal dose with low TSH, yet the summary states that patients treated with LT4 to euthyroid TSH goals may experience more symptoms than people without treated hypothyroidism, and increasing LT4 dose does not affect these symptoms. Psychological distress among those referred for thyroid testing was approximately twice as high as in the general population under physician care, with 54% versus 19% having GHQ scores > 3.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1be19404]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

### Outcomes and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypothyroidism: a retrospective analysis [^b53deaf7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer treatment cause immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), including thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism. The management and outcomes of this irAE are not well established.

Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the onset, management, and outcomes of patients experiencing hypothyroidism from ICI.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of adults receiving ICI therapy at a community cancer center between January 1, 2017, and February 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was to describe onset (timing) of hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 10 µIU/mL). Secondary outcomes included describing hypothyroidism symptoms and levothyroxine use, time to documented disease progression, and occurrence of additional adverse effects (AEs).

Results

Of the 200 patients included in the study, 19% developed clinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 µIU/mL, or required initiation of or dose increase in levothyroxine). Median time to TSH higher than 10 µIU/mL was 13.3 weeks and symptoms of hypothyroidism occurred in 34% of patients developing clinical hypothyroidism. The median final daily levothyroxine dose was 88 mcg (0.88 mcg/kg). Time to disease progression was longer in those with clinical hypothyroidism (27.4 months vs. 6.8 months, respectively, P = 0.015). Additional AEs occurred in 68% of those developing hypothyroidism versus 49% without hypothyroidism (P = 0.029).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients with clinical hypothyroidism during ICI treatment may have improved cancer outcomes, but they also are more likely to develop other AEs. Patients requiring thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine may benefit from a starting dose between 50 and 100 mcg/day, approximately 0.88 mcg/kg/day.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^e829a6fb]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for congenital hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to evaluation of hypothyroidism permanence, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a trial off levothyroxine therapy at 3 years of age as follows if permanent CH has not been confirmed, particularly if the patient is adequately treated with a low dose of levothyroxine (< 2 mcg/kg/day):

- discontinue levothyroxine for 4 weeks, then measure serum TSH and fT4 levels

- confirm transient CH if TSH and fT4 levels remain in the age-specific reference range

- confirm permanent CH and reinstitute levothyroxine therapy if the TSH is > 10 mIU/L and/or fT4 is low.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^48e51440]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Hypothyroidism: an update [^e710cd43]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a clinical disorder commonly encountered by the primary care physician. Untreated hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, infertility, cognitive impairment, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest that about one in 300 persons in the United States has hypothyroidism. The prevalence increases with age, and is higher in females than in males. Hypothyroidism may occur as a result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common etiology of hypothyroidism in the United States. Clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism are nonspecific and may be subtle, especially in older persons. The best laboratory assessment of thyroid function is a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone test. There is no evidence that screening asymptomatic adults improves outcomes. In the majority of patients, alleviation of symptoms can be accomplished through oral administration of synthetic levothyroxine, and most patients will require lifelong therapy. Combination triiodothyronine/thyroxine therapy has no advantages over thyroxine monotherapy and is not recommended. Among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, those at greater risk of progressing to clinical disease, and who may be considered for therapy, include patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels greater than 10 mIU per L and those who have elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

Severe cases may present with "TSH values > 1000 mIU/L". For OHI, "LT4 replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with OHI with the dose adjusted for weight or body surface area", using age bands where "The LT4 dose for patients 1–3 years of age is 4–6 μg/kg/d, for patients 3–10 years the LT4 dose is 3–5 μg/kg/d, and for patients 10–16 years the LT4 dose is 2–4 μg/kg/d", and "LT4 may also be dosed based on body surface area calculated at 100 μg/m2/d". Expectations should be realistic because "Reduction in pretreatment weight should not be presumed with initiation of LT4 replacement therapy".

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^8ff88d78]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^2074dd32]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in combination with free thyroxine (T4) levels within the reference range. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent condition in the general population, in particular among women and older adults, with a prevalence up to 10% to 15%. Increasing evidence suggests that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism should not routinely be treated with levothyroxine. Current guidelines recommend levothyroxine therapy for adults with TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing. Levothyroxine has become the most prescribed drug in the US in 2014 and the second most prescribed drug in the UK in 2019. More frequent testing or lower TSH thresholds could be potential reasons for the increase in levothyroxine prescription.

Among other indicators, depressive symptoms are a common reason for starting levothyroxine therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. A recent meta-analysis of 4 trials on the effect of levothyroxine therapy in adult patients with subclinical hypothyroidism found no benefit for depressive symptoms, but data were limited by small sample sizes (N = 57–94) and potential biases, such as risk of bias assessment and publication bias.

The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) trial was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the benefits of levothyroxine for patients 65 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism. Our study aimed, first, to assess the possible effect of levothyroxine therapy on depressive symptom scores in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism from the TRUST trial, and second, to update the previous meta-analysison the effect of levothyroxine therapy on depressive symptoms scores including the results from the TRUST trial.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^8200afe8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is the most common pregnancy-related thyroid disorder, affecting 3–5% of all pregnant women. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common than is overt hypothyroidism, and is usually defined as a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration greater than the pregnancy-specific reference range for each laboratory value, or by serum TSH concentrations greater than 2·5 mIU/L in the first trimester and greater than 3 mIU/L in the second and third trimesters. Some authors have defined subclinical hypothyroidism as a serum TSH between 5 and 10 mIU/L, and overt hypothyroidism as a serum TSH greater than 10 mIU/L, but this is not the commonly accepted definition. Once overt hypothyroidism is diagnosed, treatment with levothyroxine should be started to achieve serum TSH concentrations within the reference ranges for pregnancy as soon as possible. For patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, recommendations for therapy differ between various professional groups as a result of inconsistent data from both observational studies and clinical trials regarding the benefits for the mother or the child. Similarly, because benefits of therapy are still uncertain, universal screening of all pregnant women for subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity is not recommended by most professional groups. During gestation, an increase in levothyroxine dose is required in more than 50% of women with previously diagnosed hypothyroidism, and can be managed by increasing the levothyroxine dose by 30% when pregnancy is confirmed.

### Role of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism [^2f047d02]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^04a4a7e0]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^c0d4955f]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed by measuring TSH levels using a sensitive assay (second generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.1 mIU/L or third generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.01 mIU/L) and measurement of free-T4.

The adequacy of therapy is determined by periodic assessment of appropriate laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. The choice of laboratory tests depends on various factors including the etiology of the underlying thyroid disease, the presence of concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, and the use of concomitant medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions). Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVOTHROID®may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or decreased T4potency of the drug product.

Adults

In adult patients with primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism, serum TSH levels (using a sensitive assay) alone may be used to monitor therapy. The frequency of TSH monitoring during levothyroxine dose titration depends on the clinical situation but it is generally recommended at 6–8 week intervals until normalization. For patients who have recently initiated levothyroxine therapy and whose serum TSH has normalized or in patients who have had their dosage of levothyroxine changed, the serum TSH concentration should be measured after 8–12 weeks. When the optimum replacement dose has been attained, clinical (physical examination) and biochemical monitoring may be performed every 6–12 months, depending on the clinical situation, and whenever there is a change in the patient's status. It is recommended that a physical examination and a serum TSH measurement be performed at least annually in patients receiving LEVOTHROID®(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: statement by the British thyroid association executive committee [^220cbadb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective and safe, and most patients report improved well-being on initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer with symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and of considerable public interest. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines have been based on extensive reviews of the medical literature and include sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) in individuals who are persistently dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy. This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarises the key points in these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism based on the current literature, review of the published positions of the ETA and ATA, and in line with best principles of good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry, (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation, (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^32fb5434]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Children at risk for hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: THYQUIDITY dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester- specific range, increase the dose of THYQUIDITY by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable THYQUIDITY dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce THYQUIDITY dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure THYQUIDITY dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust THYQUIDITY dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 mIU per liter, and this usually requires a THYQUIDITY dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

### Management of hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy [^00e93a55]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism during pregnancy, in the preconception period, and in the postpartum period.

Methods

A literature review of English-language papers published between 1982 and 2022, focusing on the most recent literature.

Results

During pregnancy, thyroid function laboratory tests need to be interpreted with regard to gestational age. Overt hypothyroidism, regardless of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, should always be promptly treated when it is diagnosed before conception or during pregnancy or lactation. Most women with pre-existing treated hypothyroidism require an increase in levothyroxine (LT4) dosing to maintain euthyroidism during gestation. LT4-treated pregnant patients need close monitoring of their serum TSH levels to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment. There is no consensus about whether to initiate LT4 in women with mild forms of gestational thyroid hypofunction. However, in light of current evidence, it is reasonable to treat women with subclinical hypothyroidism with LT4, particularly if the TSH level is > 10 mIU/L or thyroperoxidase antibodies are present. Women who are not treated need to be followed up to ensure that treatment is initiated promptly if thyroid failure progresses. Additional studies are needed to better understand the effects of the initiation of LT4 in early gestation in women with subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinemia and determine optimal strategies for thyroid function screening in the preconception period and during pregnancy.

Conclusion

The diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism in the peripregnancy period present specific challenges. While making management decisions, it is essential to weigh the risks and benefits of treatments for not just the mother but also the fetus.
