## Question

Causes of acute splenic infarcts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of acute splenic infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and vascular anatomy that make splenic infarction possible. Then, I should categorize the etiologies by mechanism, starting with thromboembolic causes and moving through local vascular, mechanical, hematologic, infectious, vasculitic, iatrogenic, therapeutic, and hemodynamic factors. Next, I will identify risk factor modifiers that change pretest probability. After that, I should review the clinical presentation and imaging patterns to support diagnosis. Finally, I will consider prognosis, complications, and propose a practical hierarchy for clinical prioritization while verifying any earlier assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation. The spleen is perfused primarily by the splenic artery from the celiac trunk, and infarction occurs when arterial inflow is interrupted, producing ischemic necrosis that can be segmental or global depending on the level of occlusion; on CT, infarcts are classically wedge-shaped hypodensities with the base at the capsule, and complete infarction can show global nonenhancement with capsular rim enhancement from short gastric collaterals, which I need to keep in mind when correlating with clinical stability and rupture risk [^117Nd4s5] [^115UEzRe]. Occlusion of the main splenic artery can cause complete infarction, whereas occlusion of segmental branches produces focal wedge-shaped infarcts [^117Nd4s5] [^1122DRGj].

> I will now examine thromboembolic causes, since these are often predominant. Cardioembolic events from atrial fibrillation are a leading cause of large splenic infarcts, and similar emboli can arise from mural thrombus after myocardial infarction or valvular pathology in infective endocarditis, producing wedge-shaped or even complete infarcts if the main artery is occluded; I should also remember that patients with mesenteric emboli frequently have synchronous emboli to other viscera, and small studies in cardioembolic stroke populations have demonstrated subdiaphragmatic visceral infarcts including the spleen, so a search for a unifying embolic source is warranted [^117Nd4s5] [^114p5Sem] [^1176ympB] [^111dzt32] [^113h8DDo]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; aortic atheroma and cholesterol emboli can also seed the splenic circulation, so in the absence of clear cardiac sources, I should broaden the embolic workup to include the aortic arch and consider systemic embolic showers when multiple organs are involved [^1178gvSU].

> Next, let me consider local vascular pathology of the splenic artery. In situ thrombosis or aneurysmal disease of the splenic artery can compromise perfusion and lead to partial or total infarction, sometimes with associated pancreatic ischemia; importantly, guidelines advise open repair for distal or mycotic splenic artery aneurysms to mitigate end-organ ischemia and infectious risk, which underscores why vascular causes must be recognized early on imaging and multidisciplinary evaluation considered [^116yGzRW] [^115cZMj2]. I should double-check for vasculitic medium-vessel disease such as polyarteritis nodosa that can cause stenoses, aneurysms, and downstream infarcts; these cases can present subtly, so dedicated arterial phase CT and clinical correlation for systemic vasculitis are essential [^111yKdfs] [^1122DRGj].

> Let me think about mechanical and venous contributors. Splenic torsion in a wandering spleen or torsion of an accessory spleen interrupts arterial inflow via pedicle twisting and can culminate in complete infarction requiring urgent surgical management; careful attention to splenic position and vascular pedicle on imaging can prevent delay in therapy, and I should verify for prior ligamentous laxity or congenital anomalies when clues are subtle [^11779yJh] [^116essBv] [^111CGC6S]. I initially thought splenic or portal vein thrombosis would directly cause arterial infarction, but wait, I should clarify: venous thrombosis causes congestive outflow obstruction with secondary ischemia and infarction risk in certain contexts, and it often coexists with systemic prothrombotic states or pancreatitis, so distinguishing primary arterial inflow failure from venous congestion is important for management and anticoagulation decisions [^111gwxDN] [^115UEzRe].

> I need to check hematologic disorders next. In sickle cell disease, rigid erythrocytes occlude the microvasculature of the red pulp causing recurrent micro-infarctions that ultimately lead to hyposplenism or autosplenectomy with calcifications, a pattern that differs from macro-embolic events and mandates anticipatory infection risk counseling and vaccination strategies [^116sSnZT]. Myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly JAK2-positive phenotypes, markedly increase the risk of splanchnic vein thrombosis, which can secondarily involve splenic perfusion; recognizing this association allows for targeted hematologic evaluation when otherwise unexplained thrombosis or infarction occurs in younger patients or those without atherosclerotic disease [^111gwxDN] [^115CTNZD]. Let me reconsider lymphoproliferative disorders as well, because infiltrative disease and hyperviscosity can contribute to micro-infarcts, although the imaging pattern often overlaps and needs clinical-pathologic correlation [^117Nd4s5].

> Now, I should review infectious etiologies that can either directly injure the spleen or act via embolic mechanisms. Malaria, especially due to Plasmodium vivax, has a documented though uncommon association with splenic infarction and even rupture; the latency to diagnosis is typically about a week, and most infarcts improve with appropriate antimalarial therapy, but vigilance for rupture is required during convalescence [^11638ouS] [^115JLfCV]. Babesiosis can similarly cause infarction and even rupture in the setting of parasitemia, particularly in endemic areas, so travel and exposure histories are key at triage [^111NsukN] [^115EQ75W]. Infectious mononucleosis due to EBV is a noteworthy cause of splenic inflammation with occasional infarction and a small but real risk of rupture, usually presenting with left upper quadrant pain within days of symptom onset, which I should confirm with serology and supportive care while monitoring for complications [^113R8YPU]. In immunocompromised hosts, invasive aspergillosis and infective endocarditis can lead to septic emboli with splenic infarcts and abscesses, prompting combined antimicrobial, source control, and sometimes splenic interventions [^116VZKUr] [^1176ympB].

> But wait, systemic inflammatory and vasculitic diseases can mimic or cause these infarcts too. Medium-vessel vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa and ANCA-associated vasculitis can involve splenic arterial branches, producing wedge-shaped infarcts that improve with immunosuppression and, when indicated, anticoagulation, which means I should screen for systemic features and inflammatory markers when the vascular imaging pattern suggests vasculitis rather than atherosclerotic disease [^111yKdfs] [^1148Pv2Z] [^1122DRGj]. Wegener's granulomatosis, now termed granulomatosis with polyangiitis, has been reported with splenic involvement and distal arterial thrombosis; recognizing this helps prevent mislabeling as purely embolic disease and guides therapy toward disease control to reduce further vascular events [^113foz7Z].

> Next, I should review iatrogenic and traumatic settings where infarction is an anticipated risk. After splenic artery embolization for trauma or hypersplenism, splenic infarcts are among the most common adverse events, with distal embolization carrying higher rates than proximal approaches, and postembolization fevers or pain should trigger imaging to evaluate for infarct versus abscess formation, which can change management from observation to antibiotics or drainage [^114DBsV6] [^116yNepS]. The laparoscopic Warshaw technique, which relies on short gastric vessels for splenic perfusion after distal pancreatectomy, frequently yields early postoperative perfusion defects that usually regress within months, so I should avoid premature splenectomy unless infarction is extensive or complicated and the patient is clinically deteriorating [^111VNkSS] [^115STUFo]. Splenectomy itself increases the risk of portal and splenic vein thrombosis within days to weeks, especially in patients with large spleens or hemolytic disorders, so early imaging and anticoagulation protocols should be considered to reduce long-term portal hypertensive sequelae; I should confirm timing and risk by correlating with institutional protocols and patient-specific factors [^116jdA7Q] [^1114L4eK] [^113ix5LS].

> I should also consider therapy-related and pandemic-era contributors. Lenalidomide lists splenic infarction as a serious adverse reaction in MDS populations, reminding me to review medication profiles when infarcts are otherwise unexplained, particularly in hematology patients [^112NWynZ]. COVID-19 infection is associated with systemic hypercoagulability and has been reported with extensive visceral thromboses including the spleen, and although rare, post-vaccination thrombotic events with splenic involvement have been described, so I must balance attribution carefully and prioritize common causes first while still maintaining vigilance for these associations [^113Lf4ss] [^117Q8zu8].

> Hemodynamic insufficiency is another key piece. Cardiogenic shock and low-flow states can produce non-occlusive hypoperfusion with multiorgan infarcts including complete splenic infarction, and NOMI physiology extends across the splanchnic bed; in such scenarios, the therapeutic focus shifts to restoring perfusion and targeted revascularization when appropriate rather than solely anticoagulation, which I should verify against acute mesenteric ischemia algorithms to avoid delays in life-saving interventions [^117Nd4s5] [^111dzt32] [^1167p6KQ].

> Now, let me identify risk factor modifiers that raise suspicion for particular pathways. Splenomegaly increases infarction susceptibility by stretching arterial branches and promoting stasis and is frequently present in pediatric infarction cohorts and in infections such as malaria, so palpation and ultrasonographic sizing are not trivial in triage [^113cSAzy]. A wandering spleen predisposes to torsion and thus arterial inflow loss, so a mobile or ectopic spleen on imaging should trigger urgent surgical consultation to prevent irreversible infarction [^11779yJh] [^116essBv]. Thrombocytosis after splenectomy or embolization and underlying thrombophilias such as JAK2-positive MPN increase thrombotic risk, so early prophylaxis and tailored anticoagulation, when safe, should be considered while monitoring for bleeding complications; I need to balance this because steroids used for vasculitis may blunt symptoms and delay recognition of infarction complications [^111sk99c] [^111gwxDN] [^1148Pv2Z].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and imaging correlation to anchor diagnosis. Most patients present with acute left upper quadrant or flank pain and localized tenderness, but fever is variable, and ultrasound often underperforms compared with contrast-enhanced CT, which demonstrates the classic wedge-shaped hypodense pattern with capsular base and potential delayed enhancement; point-of-care ultrasound can be helpful at the bedside to prompt definitive CT when Doppler shows absent flow in suspected infarcts [^117Nd4s5] [^113g96zH] [^115UEzRe]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that micro-infarct patterns, such as in sickle cell disease or sepsis, will look different from macro-embolic wedges, and that recognition of complete infarction with capsular enhancement suggests preserved short gastric collateral perfusion to the capsule, which carries different rupture implications than a laceration or subcapsular hematoma in trauma [^117Nd4s5] [^115UEzRe] [^116sSnZT].

> I will now examine prognosis and complications to refine counseling and follow-up. Many iatrogenic or infection-associated infarcts regress on follow-up imaging, as seen after Warshaw technique or malaria, but persistent vascular occlusion can lead to atrophy or calcification, particularly in hemoglobinopathies; thus, timing and mechanism guide expectations and surveillance intervals [^111VNkSS] [^11638ouS] [^116sSnZT]. Hold on, I should verify the major complications: splenic abscess, especially with septic emboli from endocarditis, and rupture, which is more likely with large infarcts and certain infections such as EBV and malaria, both requiring a low threshold for repeat imaging and escalation to drainage or splenectomy when clinically warranted [^111PHGt2] [^113R8YPU] [^11638ouS]. Rarely, pseudoaneurysm can follow pancreatitis-associated infarction or in the setting of arterial injury, necessitating vascular evaluation and potential intervention, so radiology reports mentioning perisplenic vascular changes should prompt action [^notfound]. I should confirm that in-hospital mortality from isolated splenic infarction is generally low, and when deaths occur, they reflect the severity of the underlying illness more than the infarction itself, which should calibrate the urgency of addressing root causes [^114sbL8g] [^11638ouS].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy for clinical workup while acknowledging context. In most general adult populations, primary embolic causes, especially atrial fibrillation and other cardioembolic sources, top the differential; in specific populations, hematologic diseases like sickle cell disease predominate, while infectious etiologies such as malaria, EBV, and endocarditis vary with geography and exposure; less common but high-impact local vascular, vasculitic, iatrogenic, and hemodynamic mechanisms should be actively considered when initial workup is unrevealing or imaging patterns suggest atypical pathways, and I should tailor testing accordingly to avoid missing treatable root causes [^117Nd4s5] [^1122DRGj] [^11638ouS] [^1176ympB]. Hold on, I should verify that I did not overlook trauma-related segmental infarcts or synchronous renal and splenic involvement, which further support an embolic or systemic process; incorporating this into the diagnostic strategy improves yield and guides targeted management plans [^112HvtU4] [^111dzt32] [^112imXHQ].

Acute splenic infarcts are most often due to **cardioembolic events** [^117Nd4s5] (atrial fibrillation, infective endocarditis, mural thrombi) [^1176ympB] and **hematologic disorders** [^111gwxDN] (sickle cell disease, myeloproliferative neoplasms, hypercoagulable states) [^116sSnZT] [^1122DRGj]. Other causes include splenic artery or vein thrombosis [^115UEzRe] [^1122DRGj], vasculitis [^1148Pv2Z], trauma, splenic torsion [^11779yJh], and infections such as malaria [^11638ouS] [^115JLfCV], babesiosis [^111NsukN], and COVID-19 [^113Lf4ss]. Iatrogenic causes include **splenic artery embolization** [^114DBsV6] [^116yNepS] and **splenectomy**, and rare causes include **wandering spleen** [^116essBv] and **drug-induced thrombosis** [^112NWynZ]. Prompt recognition and management are essential to **prevent complications** [^114sbL8g].

---

## Cardioembolic causes

Cardioembolic events are a **leading cause** of acute splenic infarction, typically arising in the heart or aorta and embolizing to the splenic artery or its branches.

- **Atrial fibrillation**: A common source of emboli causing splenic infarction [^112rrVYn] [^113h8DDo] [^1122DRGj].

- **Infective endocarditis**: Septic emboli from valvular vegetations can cause splenic infarction [^1122DRGj] [^1176ympB].

- **Mural thrombi**: Thrombi from myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy can embolize to the spleen [^114p5Sem] [^1122DRGj].

---

## Hematologic disorders

Hematologic conditions characterized by hypercoagulability or abnormal red blood cell morphology significantly increase the **risk of splenic infarction** [^112zSLVs].

- **Sickle cell disease**: Rigid erythrocytes occlude splenic microvasculature, causing repeated infarctions and eventual autosplenectomy [^116sSnZT].

- **Myeloproliferative neoplasms**: Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia increase thrombotic risk, including splenic infarction [^111gwxDN] [^113CtPer].

- **Hypercoagulable states**: Inherited or acquired thrombophilias predispose to splenic vein thrombosis and infarction [^111gwxDN] [^115CTNZD].

---

## Vascular occlusion

Direct occlusion of the splenic artery or vein can precipitate **acute splenic infarction**. Splenic artery thrombosis is rare but may cause **extensive infarction** [^115UEzRe] [^1122DRGj], whereas **splenic vein thrombosis** is often associated with pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancy [^115UEzRe].

---

## Vasculitis

Inflammatory vascular diseases can **cause splenic infarction** through vessel inflammation and occlusion [^1122DRGj]. These include **polyarteritis nodosa**, a medium-vessel vasculitis that can involve the splenic artery and cause infarction [^111yKdfs], and **granulomatosis with polyangiitis**, an ANCA-associated vasculitis that can also lead to splenic infarction [^1148Pv2Z].

---

## Trauma and splenic torsion

Trauma and torsion can compromise splenic blood flow and lead to **infarction** [^1166iFow]. Blunt abdominal trauma may cause **segmental splenic infarction** [^112HvtU4], and **splenic torsion** — twisting of the splenic pedicle, often in a wandering spleen — can also result in infarction [^11779yJh].

---

## Infectious causes

Certain infections can **cause splenic infarction** through direct vascular involvement or hypercoagulability [^113R8YPU].

- **Malaria**: Plasmodium species cause splenic infarction through vascular occlusion and hypercoagulability [^11638ouS] [^115JLfCV].

- **Babesiosis**: Tick-borne infection causing splenic infarction [^111NsukN] [^115EQ75W].

- **COVID-19**: Associated with hypercoagulability and splenic infarction [^113Lf4ss].

---

## Iatrogenic and procedural causes

Medical procedures and interventions can inadvertently cause **splenic infarction**. Splenic artery embolization, used in trauma or hypersplenism, can cause **infarction** [^114DBsV6] [^116yNepS], and **splenectomy** may be complicated by postoperative thrombosis leading to infarction.

---

## Rare and unusual causes

Several rare conditions have been reported to cause **acute splenic infarction**. Wandering spleen, due to congenital absence of splenic ligaments, predisposes to **torsion and infarction** [^116essBv], and **drug-induced thrombosis**, such as lenalidomide-associated thrombosis, can also cause infarction [^112NWynZ].

---

Acute splenic infarcts arise from diverse causes, including cardioembolic events, hematologic disorders, vascular occlusion, vasculitis, trauma, infections, and iatrogenic factors. **Prompt recognition and management** are essential to prevent complications [^112zSLVs] [^114sbL8g].

COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system. As a novel disease, understanding of its management and complications continues to grow. Herein, we present a case of almost complete splenic infarction in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. This case highlights the need to maintain diagnostic vigilance while investigating secondary complications of COVID-19. It is also important to stress the high incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19, which may occur anywhere in the vasculature.

### Imaging findings of splenic emergencies: A pictorial review [^1122DRGj]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Splenic infarction can be caused by various conditions such as hemoglobinopathies, cardiac emboli, torsion, collagen vascular disease, trauma, splenic artery aneurysm, pancreatic diseases, and portal hypertension. Regardless of the etiology, the main reason is perfusion deficiency, mostly caused by splenic artery injury or occlusion. The appearance of infarction principally depends on the time of the event. In the acute phase, infarcted splenic parenchyma becomes edematous due to associated inflammation and necrosis, resulting in ill-defined areas of decreased attenuation/echogenicity. Over time, the region of infarction appears as a sharply demarcated area of volume loss. In the chronic phase, fibrosis or calcification may occur.

### Splenic torsion: a rare cause of abdominal pain [^11779yJh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Splenic torsion is an exceedingly rare but clinically important disease process that should be recognized promptly by the treating physician. In this condition, there is twisting of the spleen along its vascular pedicle, subsequently leading to abdominal pain in the setting of organ ischemia. Vascular thrombosis and splenic infarction may ensue. Torsion has been described in cases of a known wandering spleen. Abnormal development of the splenic suspensory ligaments may predispose a patient to a wandering spleen. Treatment of splenic torsion is typically surgical, with goals of preservation of the spleen if possible. We present a case of a young woman who presented with left-sided chest and abdominal pain and was found to have splenic torsion with complete splenic infarction. Surgical intervention was required, and splenectomy was performed. In this case presentation, we outline the multidisciplinary approach needed to care for the patient with this rare condition.

### Computed tomography of the spleen: How to interpret the hypodense lesion [^117Nd4s5]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Splenic infarction is caused by a lack of perfusion of either certain regions of the spleen (Fig. 6a) or the entire organ (Fig. 6b). The most common event leading to infarctions of the spleen is partial or total occlusion of the splenic artery or its branches. Patients typically present with left upper quadrant abdominal pain but without fever. Large splenic infarctions are usually caused by thromboembolic conditions, mostly originating from atrial fibrillation, whereas micro-infarctions can be seen in patients with sickle cell anaemia, lymphoma, and leukaemia.

- **Transverse contrast-enhanced CT images**: Acquired during the portal-venous phase.
	- Fig. 6a: A 49-year-old woman with a large splenic infarction secondary to thromboembolism from atrial fibrillation.
	- Fig. 6b: A 42-year-old woman with a complete splenic infarction, partial renal infarction (arrow), and hepatic infarction (arrowhead) due to cardiogenic shock caused by sudden cardiac arrest.

On contrast-enhanced CT images, splenic infarctions present as wedge-shaped, hypodense areas with the base facing the splenic capsule. Enhancement of the affected region can be observed on delayed-phase images. Splenic infarctions can cause a mass effect and may present as ill-defined areas during early stages and well-defined areas during late stages. The development of secondary abscesses or splenic rupture and subsequent haemorrhage represent potential complications secondary to splenic infarction.

### Proximal splenic artery embolization using a vascular plug in grade IV or V splenic trauma - a single centre 11-year experience [^114DBsV6]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

The literature reported adverse event rates of up to 20–29% for major adverse events, which include splenic infarct, splenic abscess, and continued bleeding necessitating open splenectomy. This is comparable to moderate to severe adverse events per the new SIR guidelines, and the rate of moderate to severe adverse events is lower with proximal SAE than distal SAE as described in several reviews. The most common adverse event in this study was splenic infarct, occurring in seven of the patients (9.2%). Three patients required open splenectomy within 1–5 days following embolization, which was documented as severe adverse events, but are considered treatment failure rather than a complication of the procedure.

Following SAE, the development of a left-sided pleural effusion has been described, thought to be from irritation of the diaphragm from inflammation in upper pole splenic embolizations. This is a known adverse event described in SAE for hypersplenism, and this was investigated in this study as a surrogate marker for the degree of splenic inflammation that SAE caused. This occurred in eight of the patients in this study (10.5%), which is lower than Wu et al. (33%) that had distal embolization patients and Ekeh et al. (17%) that saw a similar number in proximal, distal, and combined SAE. There was no statistically significant difference in…

### Malaria-induced splenic infarction [^11638ouS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Splenic infarction is a rare complication of malaria. We report two recent cases of splenic infarction after Plasmodium vivax infection. No systematic review of malaria-induced splenic infarction was available; therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the English, French, and Spanish literature in PubMed and KoreaMed for reports of malaria-associated splenic infarction from 1960 to 2012.

Of the 40 cases collected on splenic infarction by Plasmodium species, 23 involved P. vivax, 11 Plasmodium falciparum, one Plasmodium ovale, and five a mixed infection of P. vivax and P. falciparum. Of the 40 cases, 2 (5.0%) involved splenectomy and 5 (12.5%) were accompanied by splenic rupture. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 8.5 days (range, 3–90 days). Improved findings after treatment were observed in 8 (88.9%) of 9 patients with splenic infarction on follow-up by computed tomography or ultrasonography. All patients survived after treatment, with the exception of one patient with cerebral malaria. Clinicians should consider the possibility of splenic infarction when malaria-infected patients have left upper quadrant pain.

### Clinical approach to splanchnic vein thrombosis: risk factors and treatment [^111gwxDN]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an unusual manifestation of venous thromboembolism involving one or more abdominal veins, such as the portal, splenic, mesenteric, and supra-hepatic veins. SVT may be associated with different underlying disorders, either local — such as abdominal cancer, liver cirrhosis, intra-abdominal inflammation, or surgery — or systemic, such as hormonal treatment and thrombophilic conditions. In recent decades, myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) has emerged as the leading systemic cause of SVT. The JAK2 mutation, even in the absence of known MPN, shows a strong association with the development of SVT, suggesting that SVT could be the first clinical manifestation of MPN. Recently, an association between SVT, particularly supra-hepatic vein thrombosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has been reported.

SVT presents with heterogeneous clinical presentations, ranging from incidentally detected events to extensive thrombosis associated with overt gastrointestinal bleeding, representing a clinical challenge for treatment decisions. In the absence of major contraindications, anticoagulant therapy is generally recommended for all patients presenting with acute symptomatic SVT. However, there is no consensus about the use of anticoagulant drugs in chronic or incidentally detected SVT. High-quality evidence on the acute and long-term management is substantially lacking, and the risk-to-benefit ratio of anticoagulant therapy in SVT still needs to be better assessed.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^113CtPer]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

For each SVT case, clot characteristics were abstracted from the radiology report, including location (portal vein [including its branches], splenic vein, mesenteric veins [superior or inferior], or hepatic veins); whether it was occlusive; presence of tumor thrombus (rather than simply bland thrombus); presence of characteristics suggesting chronicity; and whether previous imaging studies demonstrated nondiagnostic findings suggestive of SVT.

From our hospital's data warehouse, we extracted basic information, including the time and location of the SVT diagnosis (with the latter classified as outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient). For patients diagnosed in the emergency department or as inpatients, we determined whether full anticoagulation was provided after the diagnosis of SVT.

All cases were then anonymously linked to population‐based data sets using encrypted patient healthcare numbers. We linked to the Registered Patients Database (which captures the date of all Ontarian deaths, including those outside of the province) to determine if and when patients died. We also linked to the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (which captures all emergency department visits) and the Discharge Abstract Database (which captures all hospitalizations and same‐day surgeries) to determine whether, before the diagnosis of SVT, patients had ever been diagnosed with cirrhosis; had undergone epigastric surgery in the previous 6 months; or had been diagnosed with acute or chronic pancreatitis in the previous 6 months.

### Extensive thrombosis after Covid-19 vaccine: Cause or coincidence [^117Q8zu8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever one day after administration of the Covid-19 vaccine. Bloodwork revealed anaemia and thrombocytosis. Abdominal CT angiography showed a mural thrombus at the emergence of the coeliac trunk, hepatic and splenic arteries, and extensive thrombosis of the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, splenic and portal veins, and the inferior vena cava, extending to the left common iliac vein. The spleen displayed extensive areas of infarction. The aetiological investigation included assessment of congenital coagulation disorders and acquired causes, with no relevant findings. Administration of the Covid-19 vaccine was considered a possible cause of the extensive multifocal thrombosis. After reviewing relevant literature, it was considered that other causes of this event should be further investigated. Thrombosis associated with the Covid-19 vaccine is rare, and an aetiological relationship should only be considered in the appropriate context and after investigation of other, more frequent, causes.

### Association of splenic and renal infarctions in acute abdominal emergencies [^112imXHQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Splenic and renal infarctions are usually related to vascular disease or hematologic abnormalities. Their association is infrequent and rarely observed in trauma. In this study, we analyze our data to examine the occurrence of renal and splenic infarctions based on CT findings over a period of four years.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of 84 patients admitted to our Department of Diagnostic Imaging from June 1998 to December 2002. These patients underwent emergency abdominal spiral CT examinations, and there was evidence of splenic and/or renal infarction.

- **Results**: We found 40 cases of splenic infarction and 54 cases of renal infarction, with both conditions associated in 10 patients. In 26 patients, there was also evidence of intestinal infarction. A traumatic origin was found in 19 cases, while non-traumatic causes were identified in 65 patients. An association between renal and splenic infarction in the same patient was related to trauma in two cases.

- **Conclusions**: Although renal and splenic infarctions are common manifestations of cardiac thromboembolism, other systemic pathologies, infections, or trauma may lead to these occurrences. Renal infarction may be clinically and/or surgically managed successfully in most cases. Potential complications in splenic infarction include the development of pseudocysts, abscesses, hemorrhage, subcapsular hematoma, or splenic rupture; splenectomy may be necessary in these cases. Some patients with splenic and/or renal infarction may be clinically asymptomatic. The high accuracy of CT examinations is critical to allow a proper diagnosis.

### Brain embolism - answers to practical questions [^1178gvSU]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Embolism of cardiac origin accounts for about one-fourth of ischemic strokes. Strokes due to cardioembolism are generally severe and prone to early and long-term recurrence. Cardioembolism can be reliably suspected on clinical grounds but is often difficult to document. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial Doppler, echocardiogram, Holter, and electrophysiological studies can help demonstrate the source of cardioembolism.

Aortic arch atheroma is an emerging embolic source, but non-valvular atrial fibrillation remains the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke. Despite its preventive potential, continuous oral anticoagulation is prescribed for less than half of the patients with atrial fibrillation who have risk factors for embolism and no contraindications for anticoagulation. The embolic risk of patent foramen ovale is low except when combined with an atrial septal aneurysm. Available evidence does not support routine immediate anticoagulation of acute cardioembolic stroke.

### Splenic infarction in human babesiosis: Two cases and discussion [^111NsukN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We describe two patients with Babesia infection who presented with fever and multiple splenic infarcts. There were no other conditions present that could potentially be causes of splenic infarction. Although retinal infarction has been described rarely in patients with babesiosis, splenic infarction has not been reported previously in association with this infection in humans.

### Computed tomography of the spleen: How to interpret the hypodense lesion [^114AsMmX]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Haemangiomas account for the most common primary benign splenic neoplasm, with a reported autopsy prevalence of up to 14%. Multiple haemangiomas can be observed predominantly in patients with systemic angiomatosis, such as those with Beckwith-Wiedemann, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber, and Turner syndromes. Haemangiomas, congenital in origin, consist of vascular channels filled with slow-flowing blood.

On non-contrast-enhanced CT images, most haemangiomas are isodense or hypodense when compared with normal splenic parenchyma. After the administration of contrast material, haemangiomas typically exhibit early, peripheral nodular enhancement, which extends towards the centre of the well-defined lesion over time (Fig. 8). However, the enhancement pattern can differ, especially in cavernous haemangiomas, due to the presence of fibrosis and micro-infarctions. Owing to the variable enhancement pattern and differences in timing during the administration of contrast material, haemangiomas may appear slightly larger or smaller on follow-up CT images at times. The most important — though very rare — complication of splenic haemangiomas is their spontaneous rupture, which can result in extensive intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

Transverse CT images were acquired (a) before and (b, c) after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material in a 74-year-old woman with a splenic haemangioma. Note the typical nodular enhancement beginning in the arterial phase and extending in a centripetal manner during the portal-venous phase.

### Wegener's granulomatosis presenting during pregnancy with acute limb ischemia [^113foz7Z]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of a pregnant woman with Wegener's granulomatosis whose disease involved the lungs, the spleen, and a limb. Wegener's granulomatosis was clinically manifested in the 34th week of pregnancy with pulmonary infiltrates, splenic infarcts, and acute limb ischemia. Successive thrombectomies failed to maintain arterial flow in the distal limb due to the development of active vasculitis. Thrombosis of the tibial arteries and recurrence of thrombosis was a persistent clinical observation.

In the meantime, a cesarean section was performed, resulting in the successful delivery of a healthy male newborn. Because of the recent cesarean section, the patient did not undergo thrombolysis. The woman finally underwent amputation of the limb. According to the reviewed literature, this is the sixth reported case of Wegener's granulomatosis presenting with digital ischemia and the first manifested during pregnancy.

### Multidetector computed tomography of mesenteric ischaemia [^111dzt32]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

A detailed discussion of the complex pathophysiology regarding mesenteric ischaemia is outside the scope of this article but is available elsewhere. Mesenteric ischaemia presents acutely in 95% of cases and can be arterial or venous in origin according to the following four categories: embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), 40–50% of cases; acute mesenteric arterial thrombosis, 20–30%; nonocclusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI), 25%; and mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT), 5–15%.

Mesenteric emboli usually originate from left-sided cardiac chambers or valves. Emboli most commonly affect the SMA because of its high flow rate and acute angle with the aorta. They typically lodge distal to the origin of the middle colic artery, resulting in sparing of the duodenum and transverse colon. Twenty percent of patients may have synchronous emboli to other viscera, such as the spleen or kidneys.

Acute mesenteric arterial thrombosis carries the worst prognosis and typically occurs at or near the ostia of the mesenteric arteries. There is usually a background of generalised atherosclerosis and possibly chronic mesenteric ischaemia. NOMI results from low cardiac output and subsequent splanchnic vasoconstriction in such settings as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, shock, sepsis, hypovolaemia, and certain drugs. NOMI is associated with a high mortality rate and is often underdiagnosed. Treatment includes the administration of vasodilating agents.

MVT involves the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in 95% of cases. MVT may be primary (idiopathic) but is more of…

### Underlying disease is the main risk factor in post-splenectomy complication risk: Data from a national database [^111uzPxy]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical removal of the spleen improves or eliminates the symptoms of the underlying condition for many haematological diseases. However, the resulting asplenia is associated with an increased risk of infectious and vascular complications in the long term.

Splenectomy is indicated in different clinical settings to manage acute or chronic complications of specific haematological diseases, such as hypersplenism and the increased need for blood transfusions in several congenital anaemias. Failure of pharmacological first-line therapies in haematological autoimmune disorders may also require splenectomy. Splenectomy is urgently required to prevent acute, serious, and potentially fatal spleen-related complications, such as acute splenic sequestration in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and intractable haemorrhage in autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Subjects with no underlying haematological disorders may require splenectomy for abdominal trauma or for abnormalities of the spleen.

With regard to the complications of asplenia, fulminant and unresponsive-to-treatment infections (mainly caused by encapsulated bacteria) facilitated by immune impairment are a widely recognized life-threatening risk. Historical studies have reported rates of severe post-splenectomy infections ranging from 1% to 5% of cases, with infection-related mortality varying between 1.4% and 70% of patients.

It is expected that the availability of more effective vaccines and the implementation of infection management recommendations will progressively reduce the risk of infections and infection-related mortality.

### PR3 vasculitis presenting with symptomatic splenic and renal infarction: A case report and literature review [^1148Pv2Z]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, splenic infarction is an underreported but important and frequent silent feature of AAV, typically complicating GPA. This is clinically relevant as many patients will receive heavy immunosuppression to control disease activity and may be further predisposed to infection by subsequent hyposplenism. Renal infarction in AAV appears to be rare but is equally important, as infarction of the renal cortex may have a potentially significant impact on the subsequent level of renal function, beyond the damage caused by direct glomerular and tubular inflammation. The segmental nature of wedge infarction means that, unless extensive, the diagnosis is likely to be missed by renal biopsy.

We describe the first reported case of symptomatic bilateral renal cortical infarction in association with partial splenic infarction, with a good outcome following treatment with corticosteroids, rituximab, and anticoagulant therapy. There should be a low threshold for abdominal imaging in patients with AAV presenting with back or flank pain, as the presence of either renal or splenic infarction may have clinical consequences.

### A single-center experience with the laparoscopic Warshaw technique in 122 consecutive patients [^111VNkSS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Among the concerns related to adverse outcomes following laparoscopic Warshaw technique (lap-WT) are spleen-related complications, particularly splenic infarction. Ferrone et al. reported that only 3 of 156 patients (1.9%) who underwent WT required a reoperation for a splenic infarction from 3 to 100 days postoperatively, and that abdominal pain and/or fever led to these surgeries. Kohan et al. reported that some degree of splenic hypoperfusion could be observed at 1 week post-operation in 63% (22/35) of their patients who underwent lap-WT. Matsushima and colleagues reported that although lap-WT induced a splenic infarction in 24% (4/17) of their patients, all of those infarctions were focal, and none required a splenectomy. In all patients in their study, the infarcted volume was less than 50% of the spleen.

In our present study, the splenic infarction rate after lap-WT was 54.2% (66/122). Infarction of more than 50% of the spleen (grade 3) was found in 18 (14.8%) of our lap-WT patients on CT imaging on postoperative day 3. Our review of CT images further showed that splenic perfusion had returned to normal within 3 months postoperatively in 54/66 (81.8%) patients and within 12 months in 62/66 (94.0%) patients. Warshaw reported that splenic infarction does not require an intervention as long as less than one-third of the spleen is affected. Our present results suggest that splenic infarction affecting more than 50% of the spleen after lap-WT is acceptable because most of these patients will recover within 3 months.

### Management of multiple splenic artery aneurysms in the setting of portal hypertension and splenomegaly [^1118humR]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Extrahepatic portal hypertension is commonly caused by portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Clinical manifestations of this condition may include splenomegaly, varices, and ascites. Rare complications such as splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) can occur, especially in the presence of portal hypertension; however, such cases are poorly described in the literature and can, therefore, present a challenge in the investigative work-up and management.

This report presents the case of a young woman in her late 20s with chronic extrahepatic PVT caused by thrombophilic disease. She developed splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism, oesophageal varices, and multiple large SAAs. She was successfully managed through splenic artery embolization, the creation of a portosystemic shunt, and subsequently, a splenectomy.

### Pediatric splenic infarction: Assessment of associated clinical conditions and outcome [^113cSAzy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Pediatric splenic infarction (SI) is rare yet clinically significant. Publications regarding this complication are mostly limited to case reports. This is a retrospective study examining SI etiology, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes among children. Twenty-two patients (median age: 7.9 years) were included, mostly with pre-existing hematological diseases. Splenomegaly (72%), thrombocytopenia, and anemia were common. Most patients did not receive antithrombotic therapy, yet only two patients experienced recurrences. During follow-up, 36% of patients died; however, no fatalities were attributed to thrombotic or bleeding complications.

### Thrombosis in the portal venous system after elective laparoscopic splenectomy [^116uxoQz]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The occurrence of thrombosis in the portal system is an underappreciated complication of splenectomy. Presenting symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific. The short hospital stay associated with the laparoscopic approach could delay the early diagnosis of this condition unless routine imaging controls are planned after discharge.

- **Methods**: The records of 40 patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy at our institution were reviewed for clinical signs of thrombosis in the portal system and associated factors. All patients were also enrolled in a color Doppler ultrasound surveillance program.

- **Results**: Nine patients (22.5%) developed thrombosis of the splenic vein, progressing to the portal vein in five cases (12.5%). Six patients (15%) were symptomatic. Thrombosis occurred even as late as 4 months after splenectomy. Spleen weight was the only significant factor predictive of postoperative thrombosis. The combination of splenomegaly and an elevated preoperative platelet count was associated with a 75% incidence of this complication.

- **Conclusion**: The high risk of thrombosis after the laparoscopic resection of large spleens should prompt strict postoperative imaging surveillance, combined with a more aggressive anticoagulation prophylaxis.

### An adolescent with hereditary spherocytosis who presented with splenic infarction [^116fLPgR]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old male patient with known hereditary spherocytosis presented with a 4-day history of chest pain and lethargy. Upon admission, he exhibited a low-grade fever and was grossly anaemic; examination revealed splenomegaly. An ultrasound scan confirmed the splenomegaly with areas of splenic infarction. Subsequent tests suggested a possible Epstein-Barr virus infection. The patient recovered well and was found to have a functional spleen at discharge. This case report presents an unusual complication of isolated hereditary spherocytosis.

### Isolated celiac artery aneurysm with splenic artery stenosis as a rare presentation of polyarteritis nodosum: A case report and review of the literature [^111yKdfs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Polyarteritis nodosum (PAN) is a vasculitic disease that affects small to medium arteries. It often presents as a systemic, multiorgan disease impacting the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and nervous system. Nonspecific signs and symptoms are hallmarks of PAN. Although it rarely affects single vessels, there have been case reports of PAN involving single intra-abdominal vessels. This case involves a 42-year-old white man who presented with mild epigastric pain but was otherwise asymptomatic. The workup revealed a rare isolated celiac artery aneurysm with concomitant stenosis of the splenic artery secondary to PAN. The patient was treated with high-dose steroid therapy, resulting in the resolution of the vasculitis and a decrease in the size of the aneurysm.

### Imaging findings of splenic emergencies: A pictorial review [^115UEzRe]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Splenic vein thrombosis is a relatively common entity in clinical practice, most commonly caused by acute or chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic malignancy. However, splenic artery occlusion is a rare condition that may manifest as entire splenic infarction with only capsule enhancement on CT (Fig. 8). Capsular enhancement is related to preserved arterial flow from short gastric arteries. The splenic artery is best evaluated on arterial phase CT images (Fig. 8). Infarction can be complicated by abscess formation, hemorrhage, and rupture. However, due to preserved capsular enhancement, rupture is unlikely in splenic infarct. In the case of complication, splenectomy can be considered as a treatment option.

- **Figure description**: Splenic artery thrombosis:
(a) Axial contrast-enhanced arterial phase CT of a 74-year-old man with atrial fibrillation demonstrates patent (arrow) and thrombosed (arrowhead) portions of the splenic artery.
(b) MIP and (c) VR CT images more clearly demonstrate thrombosed splenic (arrowhead) and patent hepatic (arrow) arteries.
(d) Axial and (e) coronal contrast-enhanced CT images at venous phase reveal diffuse splenic infarct (asterisks) resulting from splenic artery thrombosis. Capsular enhancement is seen around the spleen (arrows in d).

### Unexpected source of bacteraemia [^1138Z7As]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical features of an infected aneurysm depend on the location. They commonly present with a painful, pulsatile, and enlarging mass or a febrile illness with insidious onset, anorexia, and lethargy. With disease progression, patients can develop bacteraemia, rupture, and haemorrhage of the aneurysms.

Deeper-infected aneurysms are harder to elicit, as a patient could present with minimal signs. These should always be suspected in elderly patients with vascular risk factors who present with unexplained bacteraemia. The patient in this case report presented with hoarseness, which is believed to be due to thoracic aortic arch aneurysm causing impingement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Other clinical presentations of deeper infected aneurysms include gastrointestinal bleeding (due to an aorta-duodenal fistula), heart failure, or massive haemoptysis.

The most common microorganisms that caused infected thoracic aortic aneurysms were non-typhoidal Salmonella (57%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%). Mycotic aneurysms from gram-negative microorganisms present with a higher incidence of aneurysm rupture and mortality compared with those from gram-positive microorganisms. This is thought to be due to bacterial seeding of a susceptible atherosclerotic aorta. A thoracic mycotic aneurysm is an extremely rare source of P. mirabilis bacteraemia, with only one case report being found in a literature review by Semba et al. Another case report of a mycotic aneurysm involving the internal carotid artery was also associated with P. mirabilis infection.

### Splenic infarction: 10 years of experience [^114sbL8g]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the clinical presentation of splenic infarction. A retrospective examination of files during a 10-year period was conducted. Only computed tomography-proven diagnoses of splenic infarction were included. Signs, symptoms, medical history, and results of investigations were recorded.

We found 49 episodes of acute splenic infarction. Abdominal or left flank pain was the most common symptom (80%), and left upper quadrant tenderness was the most common sign (35%). Splenic infarction was the presenting symptom of underlying disease in 16.6% of the patients. Based on the computed tomography results, ultrasound was diagnostic only in 18% of patients. There was no in-hospital mortality or serious complications.

We present, to the best of our knowledge, the largest series of patients with splenic infarction diagnosed on clinical and radiological grounds. Awareness of the diagnostic possibility of splenic infarction in a patient with unexplained abdominal pain is important because it can be the presenting symptom of potentially fatal diseases.

### Old complication, new presentation: A case of the spleen taking the bullet [^114p5Sem]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 43-year-old man who presented to the accident and emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound investigation showed non-specific splenic pathology, and treatment for a splenic abscess was started. The patient later described a history of episodic, cardiac-sounding chest pain occurring at rest, the most recent case of which (6 days prior to admission) had been unusually severe. ECG showed anterior Q waves and aneurysm-type ST-T segment changes. Echocardiography, coupled with a CT scan of the abdomen, revealed the aetiology: the patient had sustained an anterolateral myocardial infarction, which had led to mural thrombus formation and secondary embolisation to the spleen, with no other end organ damage detected. The patient responded well to conservative management of the splenic infarct and initiation on the acute coronary syndrome pathway. Coronary angiography showed mild disease of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Cardiac MRI at 1 month confirmed an ischaemic aetiology.

### Splenic infarction associated with acute infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus infection [^113R8YPU]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to report a case of a previously healthy 20-year-old woman diagnosed with splenic infarction following infectious mononucleosis (IM) by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and to perform the first systematic review of the clinical characteristics of splenic infarction associated with IM. A systematic review was conducted using English, French, and Japanese literature on splenic infarction associated with IM due to EBV infection published between 1961 and 2015 in PubMed Medline. A total of 19 cases were extracted from the collected articles.

- **Clinical findings**: Left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain was observed in 15 (79%) patients. Splenectomy was performed in five (26%) cases, among which four patients presented with stable vital signs. Splenic rupture was accompanied in two (10%) patients.

- **Timing of diagnosis**: The median time from the onset of IM symptoms to the diagnosis of splenic infarction was 5 days (range, 1–25 days).

- **Treatment outcomes**: Fourteen (74%) of 19 patients experienced improvement through medical treatment, and there were no deaths.

Splenic infarction associated with IM due to EBV infection can show a favorable clinical outcome after medical treatment. Clinicians should consider the possibility of splenic infarction when patients with IM experience LUQ pain. J. Med. Virol. 89:332–336, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^116yGzRW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for splenic artery aneurysm, more specifically with respect to indications for repair, SVS 2020 guidelines recommend considering performing open surgery, including possible splenectomy, as opposed to endovascular methods for the treatment of distal splenic artery aneurysm adjacent to the hilum of the spleen. This recommendation is given due to concerns about the possibility of end-organ ischemia, including splenic infarction and pancreatitis.

### The postoperative splenic/portal vein thrombosis after splenectomy and its prevention — an unresolved issue [^116jdA7Q]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing splenectomy have an increased risk of splenic/portal vein thrombosis. We used several databases to identify publications dealing with this risk and analyzed incidence, risk factors, and outcome. The risk of splenic portal vein thrombosis has been addressed in prospective and retrospective randomized or non-randomized studies. Considering all studies combined, the overall risk is 3.3%.

Risk factors include large spleens, such as those associated with myeloproliferative disorders, and hereditary hemolytic anemias, whereas the risk is low in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and trauma. The incidence is approximately the same in both laparoscopic and open splenectomy. The median time from splenectomy to symptomatic splenic vein thrombosis is 8–12 days.

Postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis varied from no prophylaxis to heparin for seven days or longer. Treatment of symptomatic splenic vein thrombosis with heparin and warfarin leads to complete resolution of thrombosis in 67% of cases, partial resolution in 13%, while persistent occlusion, portal hypertension, or cavernoma occurred in 20%. The long-term outcome of treatment failures is unknown.

Well-designed randomized studies on the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after splenectomy are urgently needed.

### Unusual complications from Babesia infection: Splenic infarction and splenic rupture in two separate patients [^115EQ75W]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is a zoonotic parasitic infection transmitted by the tick, Ixodes scapularis. Splenic infarct and rupture are infrequent complications of Babesia parasitemia and have not been previously reported in the emergency medicine literature.

- **Case report**: We present two separate cases seen within one month at our institution: a case of splenic rupture and another case of splenic infarction due to Babesia parasitemia.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Babesia infection in humans is increasingly prevalent in both the United States and worldwide, and clinical manifestations can range from subclinical to fulminant infections. An unusual but potentially fatal complication of babesiosis is splenic infarctions and rupture. Due to the endemicity of this parasite, a careful history and level of suspicion will enable the emergency physician to consider and test for babesiosis in patients with splenic injuries and without obvious traditional risk factors.

### High incidence of thrombosis of the portal venous system after laparoscopic splenectomy: a prospective study with contrast-enhanced CT scan [^1114L4eK]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The aims of this prospective study were to investigate the true incidence of portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) after elective laparoscopic splenectomy using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, and the outcome of anticoagulant therapy for PSVT.

Although rare, thrombosis of the portal venous system is considered a possible cause of death after splenectomy. The reported incidence of ultrasonographically detected PSVT after elective open splenectomy ranges from 6.3% to 10%.

Twenty-two patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy (LS group), and 21 patients underwent open splenectomy (OS group). Preoperative and postoperative helical CT with contrast were obtained in all patients, and the extent of thrombosis was investigated. Prothrombotic disorder was also determined.

PSVT occurred in 12 (55%) patients of the LS group, but in only 4 (19%) of the OS group. The difference was significant (P = 0.03). Clinical symptoms appeared in 4 of the 12 LS patients. Thrombosis occurred in the intrahepatic portal vein (n = 9), extrahepatic portal vein (n = 2), mesenteric veins (n = 1), proximal splenic vein (n = 4), and distal splenic vein (n = 8). Prothrombotic disorder was diagnosed in 1 patient. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated once the diagnosis was established, and complete recanalization, except for distal splenic vein, was observed without any adverse event. Patients with splenomegaly were at high risk of PSVT.

PSVT is a more frequent complication of laparoscopic splenectomy than previously reported.

### Computed tomography of the spleen: How to interpret the hypodense lesion [^1164jUSa]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Focal hypodense lesions of the spleen are frequently encountered on computed tomography (CT) images of the abdomen. Although the majority of hypodense splenic lesions do not require dedicated management or follow-up, some findings warrant closer attention. Interpretation of a hypodense lesion in the spleen can be challenging and often can only be performed correctly when certain imaging patterns are considered and the clinical history is taken into account. The purpose of this article is to review and discuss the characteristic CT imaging findings of hypodense lesions of the spleen and to illustrate selected cases in the context of the patient's history.

### Nontraumatic splenic emergencies: Cross-sectional imaging findings and triage [^112zSLVs]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The spleen is commonly involved in a wide spectrum of hematologic, immunologic, neoplastic, infectious, and vascular systemic disorders. Sometimes overlooked on imaging studies outside the trauma setting, the spleen may harbor severe infections and occasionally undergo spontaneous bleeding or rupture. This pictorial essay reviews common and unusual causes of nontraumatic acute abnormalities primarily involving the spleen and their cross-sectional imaging appearances.

Emphasis is placed on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging, which represents the modality of choice to comprehensively assess acute splenic disorders, including partial or complete infarctions, vascular diseases such as venous thrombosis, abscess collections, bleeding, and rupture. State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging represents a problem-solving technique. Borrowing from experience with grading abdominal trauma according to the traditional American Association for the Surgery of Trauma scale, spontaneous splenic injuries are confidently detected and characterized at MDCT. Furthermore, MDCT allows the identification or exclusion of coexistent perisplenic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage, the presence and source of active bleeding, and contained vascular injury.

Occasionally idiopathic, spontaneous splenic injuries should be suspected when acute abdominal manifestations and signs of hemodynamic compromise occur in a background of acute viral infections, endocarditis or sepsis, malaria, immune suppression, hematological disorders, malignancies, coagulopathy, or therapeutic anticoagulation. These uncommon yet significant occurrences highlight the importance of thorough imaging and clinical evaluation.

### CT diagnosis of splenic infarction in blunt trauma: Imaging features, clinical significance and complications [^112HvtU4]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The object of this study is to describe the appearance, complications, and outcome of segmental splenic infarctions occurring after blunt trauma using computed tomography (CT).

- **Materials and methods**: Thirteen blunt trauma patients were identified with splenic infarction on contrast-enhanced CT. CT images were retrospectively reviewed and the percentage of infarcted splenic tissue and presence of splenic injury separate from the site of infarction were identified. Splenic angiograms were reviewed, and follow-up CT images were assessed for interval changes in the appearance of the infarcts.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients was 32 years, and the most common mechanism of injury was road traffic accident. The majority (54%) had 25–50% infarction of the spleen. Splenic angiograms were performed in nine patients, and seven demonstrated wedge-shaped regions of decreased perfusion corresponding to the infarction seen on CT, with no need for intervention. Eleven patients underwent a follow-up CT that demonstrated the following: no significant change in six, near-complete resolution in two, delayed appearance of infarction in one, abscess formation in one, and delayed splenic rupture in one.

Segmental splenic infarction is a rare manifestation of blunt splenic trauma. The diagnosis is readily made using contrast-enhanced CT. The majority will decrease in size on follow-up CT and resolve without clinical sequelae. Resolution of infarction is also seen, and these cases are best described as temporary perfusion defects. Splenic abscess or delayed rupture are uncommon complications.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture, an underrated cause of acute abdomen [^114sUGoh]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The majority (over 80%) of reported atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) cases are treated surgically, with splenectomy being the treatment of choice for patients with underlying malignancies. However, similar to low-grade splenic traumas in hemodynamically stable patients, there is an increasing trend towards non-operative management for ASR, achieving a high (80%) success rate with correct patient selection. Conservative treatment, including bed rest, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusions, is particularly appealing in young and pediatric patients with acute infections, as preserving the spleen prevents long-term infectious morbidity. Strict clinical, laboratory, and imaging monitoring is required during nonoperative management; multidetector CT consistently allows assessment of changes in the size and attenuation of hematomas over time. Although operator-dependent and lacking panoramicity, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound allows younger patients to avoid irradiation from repeated CT studies.

Increasingly adopted to manage traumatic splenic injuries, interventional treatment with transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) may also prove a valuable non-surgical option for ASR, particularly in cases associated with anticoagulation, malaria, and mononucleosis, and when CT detects active arterial bleeding. In selected patients, TAE is useful as a temporary stabilizing measure. Combined with intensive care, interventional radiology may allow a more rapid and safer haemostasis than surgery alone.

### Splenic and pancreatic abscesses associated with in situ thrombosis of splenic artery [^116kbHxh]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Splenic infarction is rare and occurs when the splenic artery or its branches become occluded, either by an embolus or by in situ thrombosis. In situ thrombosis of the splenic artery leading to splenic and pancreatic abscess formation after infarction is rare. We present the case of a 65-year-old man who was found to have acute complete splenic and distal pancreatic infarction and abscess formation attributable to in situ thrombosis of the splenic artery.

### Many faces of acute bowel ischemia: Overview of radiologic staging [^11479ESh]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Arterial etiologies are the most prevalent causes of acute bowel ischemia (ABI), accounting for 60–70% of cases. Arterial embolus and thrombosis are the most important subtypes.

- **Emboli**: Mesenteric arterial emboli (MAE) account for approximately half of all ABI cases. Arterial emboli typically originate from the heart, mainly caused by atrial fibrillation, structural abnormalities, or ischemic heart disease. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is more frequently affected than the celiac artery (CA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) due to its larger diameter and sharper branching angle (~45º). Considerable narrowing of the SMA immediately after the branching of the middle colic artery creates a vulnerable location for lodging emboli, which leads to isolated ischemia of the jejunum, ileum, and proximal colon, with the duodenum and transverse colon usually being spared. The lodgment also depends on the size of the embolus, with larger emboli tending to occlude proximal mesenteric arteries, resulting in greater extents of ischemia and poorer prognosis. In contrast, smaller emboli are usually trapped in distal branches, causing limited intestinal involvement with better prognosis. Emboli may also cause end-organ infarctions, including in the lower extremities, spleen, kidneys, and brain.

Figure 9 illustrates these cases:

- a) A 52-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presenting with diffuse abdominal pain and guarding. There is a central filling defect (arrowhead) within the SMA approximately 5 cm from the SMA ostium, compatible with an acute embolus associated with multifocal pneumatosis (thick arrow) and mesenteric venous gas (thin arrows), consistent with late-stage ischemia.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^111A3jx2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

This study suggests that a large maximum diameter of the splenic vein (≥ 17 mm) on CT before PSE and a high percentage of infarcted spleen (≥ 58.2%) are associated with the risk of PVST appearance and growth after PSE. When the maximum diameter of the splenic vein is large (≥ 17 mm) before PSE, earlier testing may be recommended to detect the development of thrombus.

### Abdominal computed tomography scan: a useful diagnosis tool for early and delayed splenic complications in malaria [^115JLfCV]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We read with great interest the study on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan during acute vivax malaria in South Korea by Kim and others.

In our recent analysis of 55 cases of pathological rupture of the spleen in malaria, we found that 23 (42%) were caused by Plasmodium vivax. We therefore agree with Kim and others that infection with P. vivax — less prevalent worldwide than Plasmodium falciparum — likely carries a higher risk of splenic complications than infection with P. falciparum. Acute splenic enlargement, which is as frequent in P. vivax as in P. falciparum infection despite lower mean parasitemia in the former, is likely to be a major determinant of both splenic infarction and splenic rupture in malaria. Splenic enlargement during lethal falciparum malaria likely results from splenic congestion with surface-altered and mechanically altered red blood cells (either infected or uninfected), and with migration or local multiplication of white blood cells. Because patients with vivax malaria rarely die, post-mortem data on the spleen in this context are very limited.

The mechanistic connections between malaria, splenic infarction, and pathological splenic rupture are not clearly established. Although splenic infarction leads to splenic rupture in a small number of patients, 53 of the 55 malaria patients with pathological splenic rupture had no obvious signs of pre-existing infarction.

Not least, pathological rupture of the spleen and other splenic complications may occur well beyond the acute phase of the malaria attack.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of acute mesenteric ischemia: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery Emergency General Surgery Algorithms Working Group [^1167p6KQ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Revascularization: Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, we recommend completing revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories: arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). The relative distribution of these categories depends upon the patient population being served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

- **Arterial embolism**: Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all AMI diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have concomitant atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved due to its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concomitant emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Thrombolytic therapy is an option, but it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse the clot and risks the progression of bowel ischemia. Post-intervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small emboli.

### Follow-up strategies for patients with splenic trauma managed non-operatively: The 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document [^111sk99c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Research question: What is the optimal timing and type of antithrombotic prophylaxis for patients with splenic trauma treated with NOM? (High priority).

- **Statements**: In the absence of contraindications related to associated injuries or conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic diathesis, or patients under anticoagulation therapy, the best available evidence supports that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis can safely be initiated within 48–72 hours of admission for blunt splenic trauma, regardless of injury grade, without concern for exacerbation of bleeding or failure of NOM [Quality of evidence: Moderate]. Occurrence rates of thrombocytosis in patients after SAE seem comparable to patients who undergo splenectomy, in contrast with average platelet values in those managed with observation alone. Therefore, SAE may be an independent risk factor for thrombotic events in WSES Class II–III (AAST Grades III–V) blunt splenic injuries [Quality of evidence: Moderate]. Regarding the choice between low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UH), indirect evidence from trauma cases in general, and liver trauma specifically, suggests that LMWH is superior to UH for DVT and VTE prevention and may additionally reduce pulmonary embolism (PE) and mortality [Quality of evidence: Low].

- **Recommendation**: For patients with blunt splenic injuries treated with NOM with or without splenic artery angioembolization (SAE), in the absence of specific complications, the panel suggests that DVT and VTE prophylaxis with LMWH be started.

### Infarcted ectopic spleen presenting as retroperitoneal mass [^116essBv]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Wandering or ectopic spleen is an exceptionally rare condition. Due to an abnormally long pedicle, an ectopic spleen is prone to torsion and infarction. Patients may present with abdominal pain or an acute abdomen. The incidence spans a broad age range, but there is a female predominance in the third to fifth decades of life. We present a case involving a 26-year-old female with an infarcted ectopic spleen, initially suspected to be a retroperitoneal mass on a computed tomography scan; it was later found during surgery in the lower abdomen. The minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon should be aware of this entity, as it may rarely be encountered.

### Review of proximal splenic artery embolization in blunt abdominal trauma [^116yNepS]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Complications

A multi-institutional trial assessing complications from splenic artery embolization found a major complication rate of 20% and a minor complication rate of 23%. There is statistically no significant difference in the rate of major complications, such as infection, infarction, or rebleeding requiring splenectomy when comparing proximal or distal splenic artery embolization. The only complication discrepancy between proximal splenic artery embolization (PSAE) and distal embolization is splenic infarct, with approximately three times higher rate of infarct in distal embolizations (1.6% to 3.8% rate of major splenic infarctions in distal embolization; 0.0% to 0.5% for PSAE). Signs and symptoms of infarction include left upper quadrant pain and tenderness, fever, leukocytosis, nausea and vomiting, and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level. Splenic abscess often presents with a persistent fever despite antibiotic coverage, left-sided pleural effusion, and left upper quadrant pain.

### Splenic injury from blunt trauma [^112sQvSd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Postsplenectomy vaccination against encapsulated bacteria and seasonal flu, due to the risk of secondary bacterial infection, is recommended for those with compromised splenic function. Individuals without splenic function, either due to asplenia or a postsplenectomy state, have a risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections that is more than 50 times higher, which could result in a fatal outcome. However, the routine administration of lifelong prophylactic antibiotics, although practiced in some countries to prevent overwhelming postsplenectomy infections, is not evidence-based and should not be recommended.

Recent practice management guidelines do not suggest routine vaccination following angioembolization. In this context, retained splenic immune function has been demonstrated, with no data indicating an increased risk of infectious complications.

Invasive aspergillosis is a rare but important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. In the majority of patients, invasive aspergillosis involves the lungs. Extrapulmonary involvement with total splenic infarction has not been previously described.

### Pediatric hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with liver damage, portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein thromboses: a case report [^117Miine]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare, heterogeneous disease manifesting as an unexplained persistent eosinophilia, with or without multiple tissue and organ damage. It can be divided into secondary (reactive), primary (clonal), and idiopathic HES. Infections and drug reactions are the most common secondary causes of HES. However, the local physician did not perform any blood tests at the clinic, and the guardian could not recall any prior drug therapy. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of drug-induced HES. The initial blood test was performed at the tertiary hospital, revealing an increase in the absolute eosinophil count. During the child's stay in our hospital, no signs of hypersensitivity were observed over the 25-day treatment period. Additionally, no indications of fungal or parasitic infections were detected. Following an internal discussion with the medical team, we suspected the cause might be an unknown infection.

Previous studies have reported that HES is often complicated by severe cardiac or cerebral thromboses. The abdominal CT scan showed thrombi obstructing the portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric vein. Thrombosis with end-organ damage is rare in patients with HES. A single adult case of portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis was described in 2018, while two other reports described multiple organ infiltration associated with deep vein thrombosis. We described a rare manifestation of HES in childhood, reporting concomitant severe thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and thromboses of the portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric veins. The cause of thrombocytopenia was unidentified.

### Gastrointestinal and liver diseases and atrial fibrillation: A review of the literature [^112rrVYn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) predisposing to gastrointestinal disease:

- **Mesenteric ischemia**: In patients with AF, ischemia is predominantly secondary to cardioembolic events rather than from in situ thromboembolism. Major risk factors for cardioembolic events in patients with AF include a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, age greater than 75 years, hypertension, and structural heart disease. In particular, women with AF are at increased risk for thromboembolic events, including mesenteric ischemia. Emboli to the visceral-mesenteric vasculature are the second most common site of peripheral thromboembolic disease after the vessels in the upper and lower extremities. In a Taiwan-based study of patients with AF, the risk of developing mesenteric ischemia was higher with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score, and those with a score ≥ 2 had a threefold increase in risk compared with those having a score of 0.

### Splenic infarction and abscess complicating infective endocarditis [^111PHGt2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions confronted in the emergency department. Diagnosing splenic infarction can be challenging, even for experienced physicians or surgeons, due to obscured clues. For every patient diagnosed with splenic infarction, thorough scrutiny for possible sources of emboli should be conducted. Splenic abscess should be suspected if infectious signs persist despite appropriate treatment.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential, as the condition can prove fatal. Infective endocarditis is the most common condition predisposing a patient to splenic abscess. Splenic abscess or infarction may represent different disease stages in patients with infective endocarditis due to septic emboli of the spleen. The treatment of choice has traditionally included antibiotics, splenectomy, and valve replacement surgery. However, we report a case of splenic abscess and infective endocarditis successfully treated with antibiotics alone, without the need for drainage or surgery.

### Splenic rupture after elective cardioversion [^112aKDK9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Splenic laceration and rupture are common phenomena among patients in traumatic settings, especially in cases of blunt trauma. Much more unusual, however, is splenic injury without a known insult. Several case reports and studies have documented spontaneous splenic injury in patients with viral, hematological, or malignant processes. Recently, we encountered a patient with a spontaneous splenic rupture and no preceding trauma apart from semielective cardioversion. Operative decision-making was complicated by the necessity of systemic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The patient eventually underwent a splenectomy and made an uneventful recovery.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^117E5UZj]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Measurement of Maximum Diameter of the Splenic Vein and Splenic Volume

In all cases, total splenic volume before PSE and non-infarcted and infarcted splenic volumes after PSE were measured using the SYNAPSE VINCENT analyzer (Fujifilm Medical Co. Tokyo, Japan). For measurement, delayed-phase images reconstructed at 5 mm intervals were used. After importing pre- and post-PSE images into the SYNAPSE VINCENT analyzer, regions of non-infarcted and infarcted spleen parenchyma were selected manually, with a region of interest (ROI) in each slice. The selected ROI was automatically calculated as previously reported. The percentage of infarcted spleen was calculated as (volume of infarcted spleen/volume of infarcted spleen + volume of non-infarcted spleen) × 100 (%). Since comparison of thrombus size by visual assessment is difficult, thrombus volume was measured and quantitatively assessed to identify thrombus enlargement.

The appearance or growth of PVST was evaluated by comparing results from CECT before and after PSE. Thrombus volume was similarly measured using the SYNAPSE VINCENT analyzer. The growth of PVST was defined as an increase in the volume of thrombus > 2.0 mL. Cases with the appearance or growth of PVST were stratified according to the classification of Tsamalaidze et al, which divides PVST into four types as follows: Type 1, asymptomatic thrombosis limited to the splenic vein; Type 2, asymptomatic thrombosis limited to the intrahepatic portal vein; Type 3, asymptomatic multiple or diffuse thrombosis of the portal venous system; and Type 4, symptomatic isolated, multiple thromboses of the portal venous system.

### Identification of splenic infarction by emergency department ultrasound [^113g96zH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Splenic rupture or infarction can occur secondary to acute infectious mononucleosis. Patients with abdominal pain and known or suspected infectious mononucleosis require evaluation for these complications, which can have significant morbidity or mortality.

- **Case report**: An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of left upper quadrant abdominal pain. He had been diagnosed with mononucleosis 4 days before his ED presentation. Physical examination was notable for focal left upper quadrant tenderness. The treating physician's principal diagnostic considerations were splenic rupture or infarction secondary to mononucleosis. A point-of-care ultrasound was administered by the emergency physician, demonstrating multiple hypoechoic areas in the splenic parenchyma with absent Doppler flow, consistent with multiple splenic infarcts. The patient was admitted for observation, managed conservatively, and had an uneventful course.

- **Conclusion**: Emergency ultrasound of the spleen can allow rapid diagnosis of splenic infarction and exclusion of splenic rupture in a patient at risk for splenic pathology.

### Anticoagulant therapy for splanchnic vein thrombosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^115CTNZD]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) includes portal, mesenteric, or splenic vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome. SVT is frequently associated with liver cirrhosis, solid cancers, and myeloproliferative neoplasms, and less often with oral contraceptive agents, pregnancy, abdominal infections, pancreatitis, or surgery.

Despite several observational studies and a few relatively small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatment for SVT, robust evidence on SVT management is lacking. Recommendations from international societies or expert panels remain highly variable, and in routine clinical practice, physicians have to decide empirically about the type, dose, and duration of anticoagulant therapy. A recent study-level meta-analysis including 7,969 patients with SVT suggested a potential benefit of anticoagulant treatment in terms of improved vein recanalization and reduced thrombosis progression, venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and all-cause mortality compared with no anticoagulation. Conclusions were limited by the inherent heterogeneity of included populations, the potential for immortal bias, and residual confounding.

To fill these knowledge gaps, we undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with SVT and obtain a better understanding of the incidence of clinically relevant outcomes in subgroups at higher risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications.

### Infective endocarditis [^1176ympB]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a disease that can be associated with various conditions such as splenic infarction, malaise, mitral valve prolapse, acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and glomerulonephritis. Additional associations include prosthetic heart valve complications, HIV infection, and immunocompromising conditions. Other related factors are renal infarction, poor dental health, and positive blood bacterial culture.

Patients may experience weight loss, coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and a systolic-diastolic murmur. Acute arterial occlusion, intravenous drug use, splenomegaly, hepatic infarction, hemodialysis, and anemia are also potential complications. Physical findings may include Litten's sign, Janeway lesions, aortic regurgitation murmur, peripheral edema, fatigue, heart failure (HF), cough, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Positive rheumatoid factor (RF), fever, Roth spots, chills, murmurs, and arthralgia are common symptoms. The disease is also linked to rheumatic heart disease, valvular heart disease, bicuspid aortic valve, subconjunctival hemorrhage, loss of appetite, splinter hemorrhages, and intracardiac devices. Additional complications include tachycardia, Osler nodes, diabetes mellitus, invasive candidiasis, congenital heart disease, aspergillosis, night sweats, and Bracht-Wachter bodies.

Laboratory findings may reveal increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), altered mental status, atrioventricular (AV) block, increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and hematuria. Infective endocarditis can also lead to intracranial aneurysm, pulmonary embolism (PE), brain abscess, and excessive sweating.

### Prevalence of subdiaphragmatic visceral infarction in cardioembolic stroke [^113h8DDo]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of ischemic strokes have an embolic mechanism, but the source of embolism is not detected. The coexistence of subdiaphragmatic visceral infarction (SDVI; e.g. renal, splenic, hepatic, bowel infarction) may suggest a common source of embolism. One large autopsy study found SDVI in 21.5% of patients with fatal stroke.

- **Method**: We performed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance abdominal imaging and subsequently performed it on consecutive patients with stroke or TIA and a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

- **Results**: Among 27 patients, 6 had SDVI (3 recent renal, 1 recent splenic, and 3 old splenic infarction). The median time between the onset of ischemic stroke and abdominal MRI was 8 days (interquartile range 3–15 days). No predictive factor of SDVI was found in this study population with respect to demographic or ultrasound characteristics.

- **Conclusions**: One in 5 patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke or TIA may be associated with subdiaphragmatic visceral infarction (SDVI). Further study should evaluate the frequency of SDVI in patients with stroke of unknown cause.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^114HFVq8]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Portal venous system thrombosis is a complication of partial splenic artery embolization, and pre-treatment risk assessment is thus important. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 67 consecutive patients who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography before and after first partial splenic artery embolization between July 2007 and October 2018. As risk factors, we investigated age, sex, hematological data, liver function, steroid use, heparin use, and findings from pre- and post-treatment computed tomography. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between thrombus appearance or growth and these factors. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

- **Results**: Partial splenic artery embolization was technically successful in all 67 patients. Nine patients showed appearance or growth of thrombus. Univariate analysis showed maximum diameter of the splenic vein before treatment (p = 0.0076), percentage of infarcted spleen (p = 0.017), and volume of infarcted spleen (p = 0.022) as significant risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences in maximum diameter of the splenic vein before treatment (p = 0.041) and percentage of infarcted spleen (p = 0.023). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, cutoffs for maximum diameter of the splenic vein and percentage of infarcted spleen for distinguishing the appearance or growth of thrombus were 17 mm and other specific measurements.

### A single-center experience with the laparoscopic Warshaw technique in 122 consecutive patients [^115STUFo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) images were compared to evaluate postoperative abdominal changes, splenic perfusion, and whether vessels were native or collaterals that developed after surgery. Follow-ups included a thorough medical examination and a contrast-enhanced CT scan at 3 months, followed by annual assessments after the index operation, to evaluate gastric varices and splenic perfusion, as well as any additional postoperative complications. Complications were classified according to the criteria of Clavien and Dindo. In accordance with the 2005 International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF), each pancreatic fistula was classified as grade A, B, or C.

Each radiologic study was reviewed to assess for splenic infarcts and gastric varices. Splenic infarction volumes were measured on postoperative CT scans at 3 days, and at 3 and 12 months, by a single expert radiologist. Splenic perfusion was grouped into grades based on the percentage of total splenic volume affected by the infarction: grade 0, intact; grade 1, < 25% infarction; grade 2, 25–50% infarction; grade 3, 50–70% infarction; and grade 4, > 70% infarction. When tortuous vascular structures larger than 5 mm in diameter were seen, gastric varices were diagnosed on CT images by the expert radiologist assessing the splenic infarction volume. Gastric varices located along the outside border of the gastric wall were defined as perigastric varices, and those existing within the wall of the stomach were designated as submucosal gastric varices.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^113ix5LS]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Post-splenectomy thromboembolic complications have been reported to increase the risk of early and late venous and arterial thrombosis, including acute splenic and portal vein thrombosis (SPVT) and delayed severe lifelong complications.

- **Acute splenic and portal vein thrombosis**: Acute SPVT after splenectomy is an early and life-threatening complication, which can lead to bowel ischemia and/or portal hypertension. This complication has been related to stasis in the splenic vein remnant. The risk varies depending on the underlying disorder. In 2008, Krauth et al. reviewed prospective and retrospective studies and found that 11 out of 89 patients with hemolytic disease developed SPVT (12.3%), while only 2 out of 118 patients (1.7%) with immune thrombocytopenia had SPVT. None of the 122 patients who underwent splenectomy due to trauma developed this complication. Large spleen size has also been identified as a risk factor for the development of SPVT. Although there are no well-designed randomized trials comparing the risk of SPVT after open versus laparoscopic splenectomy, the surgical approach does not seem to affect the incidence of SPVT. Screening for thrombophilia has not been shown to allow early identification of patients at risk of SPVT after splenectomy.

A study using contrast-enhanced computed tomography for the diagnosis of SPVT showed that the median time between splenectomy and the appearance of asymptomatic SPVT was 6 days (range, 3–11 days). A Canadian study of 40 patients suggested that an appropriate time for…

### Computed tomography of the spleen: How to interpret the hypodense lesion [^116sSnZT]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

While passing through the sinuses of the red pulp, the blood's hematocrit increases by approximately 60% due to plasma removal. In addition, the blood flow decelerates to allow maximal interaction of antigenic material and structurally abnormal erythrocytes with macrophages and reticuloendothelial cells. To survive this process, erythrocytes need to be deformable to pass through tiny slits between endothelial cells.

In patients with sickle cell disease, erythrocytes are rigid and frequently occlude the small sinuses of the red pulp. This leads to micro-infarctions and micro-hemorrhages, which become visible on contrast-enhanced CT as small, disseminated hypodense, ill-defined lesions. In the early course of the disease, the spleen can be enlarged. As the disease advances, the spleen loses functionality, shrinks, and may become calcified. Therefore, in patients with sickle cell disease, the presence of multiple small hypodense splenic lesions is strongly suggestive of sickle cell-induced splenic infarctions.

- **Fig. 5**: Transverse contrast-enhanced CT images acquired during the portal venous phase.
	- a. A 43-year-old man with advanced sickle cell disease. Note the irregular shape of the spleen, as well as the increased density of the splenic parenchyma, together with extensive calcifications as a consequence of constantly occurring micro-infarctions.
