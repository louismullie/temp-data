## Question

what is the full differential for elevated alk phos?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the full differential diagnosis of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding physiologic or transient causes. Then, I should verify the source of ALP using GGT and, if needed, isoenzyme fractionation. Next, I will categorize etiologies by organ system: hepatobiliary, bone, endocrine, malignancy, pediatric, and medication-related. After that, I should prioritize the most common and clinically urgent causes and outline a practical diagnostic algorithm. Finally, I will consider special populations and red flags that warrant expedited workup or biopsy, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline-backed steps throughout.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its magnitude, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a lab artifact or a transient spike. I should repeat the liver panel and, if ALP is elevated, add a GGT to confirm hepatobiliary origin, since GGT is not present in bone and will help distinguish hepatic from non-hepatic sources. I should also review prior results and the clinical context, as transient benign hyperphosphatasemia can occur in infants and young children and resolve spontaneously, and pregnancy can elevate ALP from placental isoenzyme, so I should verify age, sex, and pregnancy status before proceeding [^115PkWRv] [^115XLydM] [^115LahNR].

> Wait, let me verify the source next. If GGT is normal, I should consider bone disease or other non-hepatic sources; if GGT is elevated, I should proceed with hepatobiliary evaluation. If uncertainty remains, I can order ALP isoenzyme fractionation to separate liver, bone, intestinal, and placental fractions, which is particularly useful in children, pregnancy, or when mixed sources are suspected [^115xNaAK] [^113Fviv2].

> I will now examine hepatobiliary causes, starting with cholestatic liver diseases, because these are common and clinically important. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) typically presents with a cholestatic pattern and positive AMA in about 95% of cases, so I should check AMA and, if negative but suspicion remains, anti-SP100/anti-GP210. Diagnosis requires at least two of: cholestatic ALP, positive AMA or PBC-specific ANAs, or compatible histology, and biopsy is not routinely required if AMA is positive and imaging excludes obstruction [^115fZ5hX] [^112zmSbv] [^1122cDMW]. Hold on, I should verify the imaging step: right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line to assess for biliary dilatation and obstruction, and if ducts are dilated, MRCP or ERCP is indicated to evaluate for strictures, stones, or malignancy [^115xNaAK] [^116VCtcF].

> Next, I should review primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which often shows a cholestatic profile with elevated ALP and GGT and is diagnosed by cholangiographic multifocal stricturing after excluding secondary causes. I need to check IgG4 once to exclude IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis, and remember that ALP can normalize intermittently, so a normal ALP does not exclude PSC. In children, low GGT cholestasis suggests genetic cholestatic disorders, so I should tailor testing accordingly [^1178ujLY] [^1165dMgH] [^113213dm] [^112XLmib].

> I should confirm that I am not missing extrahepatic biliary obstruction from stones, strictures, or malignancy, because this is urgent. Ultrasound is sensitive for ductal dilatation, and if present, MRCP or ERCP with tissue sampling is indicated. If ultrasound is non-diagnostic and suspicion remains high, I should escalate to cross-sectional imaging and consider CA 19–9 and tumor markers when malignancy is a concern [^115xNaAK] [^116VCtcF].

> But wait, what if the pattern is mixed or the patient is on medications? Drug-induced cholestasis is a key consideration, so I need a meticulous medication and supplement history, including over-the-counter and herbal agents. AASLD guidance emphasizes that cholestatic injury can mimic PBC or PSC and may require withdrawal and supportive care, with biopsy reserved for unresolved cases or when overlap is suspected [^115qxYJs].

> Let me consider infiltrative and granulomatous diseases. Sarcoidosis can cause intrahepatic cholestasis with elevated ALP and granulomas on biopsy; I should screen for systemic sarcoidosis and consider chest imaging. Malignant infiltration from lymphoma, breast, colon, or other primaries can present with marked ALP and GGT elevations and may require liver or bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis, particularly in acute liver failure presentations [^112YHG7F] [^116AMfR6].

> I should double-check for vascular and congestive causes. Hepatic congestion from right-sided heart failure or Budd-Chiari can produce a cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP and bilirubin; recognizing the clinical context and using Doppler ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging can prevent mislabeling as primary hepatobiliary disease [^113Fviv2].

> Now, shifting to bone sources, I need to ensure I do not overlook common skeletal etiologies. Paget's disease typically shows marked ALP elevations from increased bone turnover and is diagnosed with plain radiographs and bone scan; total ALP correlates with disease extent and response to bisphosphonates, and guidelines recommend serial ALP for monitoring [^113Fviv2] [^116LPuzr] [^112Ptn2u]. Metastatic bone disease and primary bone sarcomas can elevate ALP, so in the right clinical context I should add LDH, calcium, and consider bone imaging or PET/CT as indicated [^111HoP9K] [^112RcPJ3].

> Hold on, I should verify endocrine and metabolic bone diseases. Hyperparathyroidism, both primary and secondary, increases bone turnover and ALP; tumor-induced osteomalacia from FGF23-producing tumors causes hypophosphatemia with elevated ALP, and vitamin D deficiency itself can raise ALP via secondary hyperparathyroidism, so I should check calcium, phosphate, PTH, and 25(OH)D to sort these out [^116ET9sF] [^115bRA4h]. In chronic kidney disease, bone-specific ALP helps assess high- versus low-turnover bone disease and guide therapy, so I should interpret ALP in that context [^116YaUQ1] [^113MS3Sw].

> I need to check pediatric-specific considerations. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common in healthy infants and toddlers, with ALP often ≥ 5× ULN and spontaneous resolution within months; recognition avoids unnecessary testing. In adolescents, rapid growth can elevate bone ALP, and vitamin D deficiency is frequent, so I should compare to age-specific norms and assess nutrition and growth trajectory [^115XLydM] [^113Fviv2].

> Let me reconsider medication and toxin-related causes broadly. Beyond prescription drugs, herbal and dietary supplements, anabolic steroids, and even energy drinks have been implicated in liver injury with cholestatic features; a careful, nonjudgmental history is essential to avoid missing these reversible etiologies [^115qxYJs] [^111dZgPt].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm. First, confirm the abnormality and add GGT to localize the source. Second, obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess ducts and parenchyma. Third, if ducts are dilated, proceed to MRCP or ERCP; if not, test for PBC with AMA and PBC-specific ANAs, and consider ANA/SMA for autoimmune hepatitis overlap. Fourth, if serologies and imaging are unrevealing and ALP remains > 2× ULN, consider liver biopsy to evaluate for small-duct PSC, sarcoidosis, drug injury, or infiltrative disease. Throughout, I should tailor testing to age, pregnancy, and comorbidities and escalate promptly if red flags are present [^114k6r3r] [^115xNaAK] [^115udJMp].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent action. Marked cholestasis with jaundice, pruritus, or systemic symptoms; evidence of biliary obstruction on imaging; or features of acute liver failure warrant expedited hepatology referral and consideration of ERCP, biopsy, or transplant evaluation. Similarly, new bone pain with elevated ALP in older adults should prompt evaluation for metastatic disease or Paget's disease [^115xNaAK] [^116AMfR6] [^111Y8Hb4].

> Finally, let me synthesize the differential by category to ensure completeness. Hepatobiliary: PBC, PSC, IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis, extrahepatic obstruction, drug-induced cholestasis, infiltrative/malignant disease, hepatic congestion, autoimmune hepatitis with cholestatic features. Bone: Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, primary bone tumors, hyperparathyroidism, tumor-induced osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency, fractures. Pediatric: transient benign hyperphosphatasemia, growth-related bone turnover, cholestatic liver diseases. Other: intestinal isoenzyme elevations, pregnancy. I should double-check that each category is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence before concluding [^111F46zi] [^1178ujLY] [^111Y8Hb4] [^115XLydM] [^113Fviv2].

Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reflects increased activity from **liver, bone, or other sources** [^113Fviv2]. The differential is best organized by source: **hepatobiliary** (cholestasis, biliary obstruction, infiltrative disease, drug-induced injury) [^115xNaAK]; **bone** (Paget's, metastases, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, fractures) [^111Y8Hb4]; **intestinal/placental** (recent meals, pregnancy) [^113Fviv2]; and **malignancy** (cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia) [^116AMfR6]. Confirm the source with **GGT or isoenzyme analysis** [^115xNaAK], then tailor imaging and labs to the likely etiology [^114k6r3r].

---

## Hepatobiliary causes

Hepatobiliary disease is the **most common source** of elevated ALP [^notfound]; confirm with GGT or isoenzyme analysis [^115xNaAK].

- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis [^115udJMp] [^113213dm].
- **Biliary obstruction**: Choledocholithiasis, strictures, malignancies (cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer) [^115xNaAK].
- **Infiltrative liver diseases**: Sarcoidosis, granulomatous hepatitis, lymphoma, amyloidosis [^113CgCwQ] [^11257LqG].
- **Drug-induced cholestasis**: Anabolic steroids, antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate), anticonvulsants, and others [^115qxYJs].

---

## Bone-related causes

Bone disease elevates ALP via **osteoblast activity**; confirm with bone-specific ALP or clinical correlation [^111Y8Hb4].

- **Metastatic bone disease**: Breast, prostate, lung, and other primaries [^notfound].
- **Osteomalacia/rickets**: Vitamin D deficiency, hypophosphatemia, tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF].
- **Hyperparathyroidism**: Primary or secondary, with bone resorption and formation [^116iu4jF].
- **Fractures and healing**: Recent fractures or orthopedic procedures [^113Fviv2].

---

## Intestinal and placental sources

Intestinal and placental ALP isoenzymes can raise total ALP; **identify by timing, pregnancy status, or isoenzyme analysis** [^113Fviv2].

- **Recent fatty meals**: Transient intestinal ALP elevation [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Placental ALP rises in late gestation [^115LahNR].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Crohn's disease can increase intestinal ALP [^notfound].

---

## Malignancy-associated causes

Several malignancies produce **ALP elevations** via direct invasion, obstruction, or paraneoplastic effects [^116AMfR6].

- **Cholangiocarcinoma**: Obstructive cholestasis with high ALP [^notfound].
- **Hepatic metastases**: Colon, breast, lung, and others [^116AMfR6].
- **Leukemia and lymphoma**: Infiltrative liver or bone disease [^115BjhFk].
- **Paraneoplastic syndromes**: Tumor-induced osteomalacia, hypercalcemia of malignancy [^116ET9sF].

---

## Physiological and transient causes

Physiological or transient ALP rises are **common and benign**; confirm with context and repeat testing [^115XLydM].

- **Growth spurts**: Children and adolescents have higher bone turnover [^113Fviv2].
- **Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy**: Self-limited, often post-viral [^115XLydM].
- **Recent meals**: Transient intestinal ALP rise [^notfound].

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach prevents unnecessary testing: confirm the elevation and **localize the source** with GGT or isoenzymes, then tailor imaging and serology to the likely etiology [^114k6r3r].

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat ALP and add GGT | Confirm elevation and hepatobiliary source [^115xNaAK] |
| 2 | Right upper quadrant ultrasound | Assess biliary obstruction, masses, liver parenchyma [^116VCtcF] |
| 3 | AMA, ANA, ASMA, IgG4 | Screen for PBC, PSC, autoimmune hepatitis, IgG4-SC [^115udJMp] [^1165dMgH] |
| 4 | Bone-specific ALP, calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D | Evaluate bone disease [^111Y8Hb4] [^116ET9sF] |
| 5 | MRCP or ERCP | Suspected PSC, strictures, or indeterminate biliary disease [^115xNaAK] |
| 6 | Liver biopsy | Unexplained intrahepatic cholestasis or infiltrative disease [^114Kk3U6] |

---

Elevated ALP has a **broad differential** spanning hepatobiliary, bone, intestinal, placental, and malignant causes. Confirm the source with GGT or isoenzyme analysis, then apply a focused diagnostic pathway to identify the underlying etiology efficiently [^115xNaAK].

What other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PBC?

The diagnosis of PBC usually causes little confusion because of the specificity and sensitivity of PBC-associated autoantibodies. Care must be taken in autoantibody-negative disease, with the chief differential being small duct PSC. Other differential diagnoses which should be considered include sarcoid, graft-versus-host disease (in appropriately at-risk individuals), idiopathic ductopenia, drug-induced liver injury and variants of genetic cholestatic syndromes. Care must also be taken with patients with 'low titre' AMA because of the danger of autoantibody false positivity in inflammatory conditions, in particular NAFLD, where low level rises in ALP are not infrequent.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

HPP is confirmed with consistently low age- and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase activity in conjunction with medical history and physical findings, radiologic findings, elevated levels of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase substrates or sequencing of the ALPL gene. In utero and postnatal recognition and diagnosis of perinatal HPP based on radiologic findings can be challenging because of features that overlap with many of the more than 400 other skeletal dysplasias, the phenotypic variability and a lack of information about the in utero natural history of HPP. The skeletal abnormalities and the gestational and postnatal ages at which they manifest vary across skeletal dysplasias, including HPP. Many sonographic and radiographic findings are not pathognomonic for a specific disorder, as obtaining reliable information regarding skeletal mineralization is difficult with prenatal sonography and computed tomography (CT). These difficulties are confounded by a general lack of familiarity with HPP among the health care providers who perform prenatal ultrasound (US) and neonatal imaging. In addition, abnormalities can be detected at earlier gestational ages than they have in the past, underscoring the need for obstetricians, ultrasonographers and radiologists to possess in-depth knowledge of the appearance of the fetal skeleton at all gestational ages. This review focuses on the role of fetal and neonatal imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of perinatal HPP.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114k6r3r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2× ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2× ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2× ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2× ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

### Rare cause of acute hepatitis: a common energy drink [^111dZgPt]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

While the serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase were elevated on presentation, we were able to narrow our differential diagnosis to various possible aetiologies of hepatitis based on the predominant hepatocellular pattern of laboratory abnormalities. We then further narrowed our differential to the hepatocellular diseases associated with elevated bilirubin and jaundice, including viral infections (eg, hepatitis A, B, C, D and E, EBV, CMV), toxic (eg, alcohol, drugs, environmental), autoimmune, Wilson disease, ischaemia and congestive hepatopathy.

Though the patient was found to have HCV infection, we did not think HCV was responsible for his acute hepatitis. HCV antibody production has a window period, with serum antibodies undetectable by assay until ∼10 weeks after the initial exposure. Being that our patient's symptoms only began 2 weeks prior, his positive serology was not compatible with an acute HCV infection, but was deemed more likely a chronic infection. In the absence of clinical signs of haemodynamic instability, we thought ischaemic hepatic injury to be less likely. Furthermore, ischaemic hepatitis is often accompanied by evidence of other end-organ hypoperfusion, such as renal acute tubular necrosis. Therefore, our patient's normal renal function on presentation did not favour the diagnosis of ischaemic hepatitis.

History and examination also made aetiologies such as alcohol, prescribed medications, illicit drugs, environmental causes and congestive hepatopathy less likely. We excluded other viral causes of hepatitis, autoimmune aetiology and Wilson disease based on laboratory results. Biopsy findings in this case were non-specific and can be seen in drug-induced or toxin-induced hepatitis, and in hepatic injury related to other causes, such as autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, coeliac disease and acute viral hepatitis. Having carefully excluded the alternative processes with similar pathological findings, the diagnosis of acute hepatitis secondary to consumption of energy drinks was rendered.

Incidentally, the patient's high levels of serum folate and vitamin B 12 were also consistent with supplemental intake, likely from energy drink usage as he denied any alternative supplementation. The diagnosis was further supported by consideration of chronological and clinical data. His liver injury was directly subsequent to excessive consumption of energy drinks, and resolved on discontinuation of the product.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^115bRA4h]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination

Physical examination identifies the consequences of hypophosphatemia and features guiding the differential diagnosis. Children may have bowing of limbs, waddling gait, in-toeing, enlargement of the wrist, knees, or ankles, frontal bossing, fusion of skull sutures, expansion of the costochondral junctions, or a horizontal groove along the thoracic border. Bone pain evident on palpation, movement, or weight bearing may be secondary to osteomalacia alone, but should prompt consideration of fracture or pseudofracture. Dental abscesses are common in XLH. Muscle weakness and abnormal gait may be present. Enthesopathy often manifests as decreased range of motion at the spine or large joints due to calcification of entheses in adults with XLH. If TIO is considered, a mass may be palpated in any part of body. Skin examination may detect café au lait macules (FD and McCune–Albright syndrome) or abnormal nevi with a variety of morphologies (pink/orange hairless plaques or brown verrucous lesions that are exophytic and friable; nevi on mucous membranes, mouth, or eyes, which could represent linear sebaceous nevi). FD may result in deformities of long bones or facial asymmetry due involved craniofacial bones.

Laboratory

We recommend collecting samples before initiating treatment to avoid confounding the results. If a patient is already receiving treatment, stopping phosphate and calcitriol for a week before testing can clarify the diagnosis. Initial evaluation includes measuring serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. While secondary hyperparathyroidism often accompanies rickets, rickets is not usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia would suggest abnormal vitamin D stores or vitamin D metabolism or a tubulopathy. Alkaline phosphatase levels are typically elevated in rickets but may be only mildly high. Normal serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase values are higher in infants and young children and decrease with age gradually to adulthood; therefore, one must be certain to compare these to age-appropriate normal ranges to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Using an adult normal range for serum phosphorus could result in missing the diagnosis of hypophosphatemia.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

Investigations

At the acute presentation and after the two episodes of sudden neurological deterioration, the patient underwent urgent non-contrast head CT and brain MRI studies. Initial tests were performed and showed that haemoglobin A1c was 6.8%, low-density lipoprotein was 100 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 51 mg/dL. They also showed pancytopenia associated with the recent chemotherapy treatments and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels due to the underlying cholangiocarcinoma. Extensive workup to investigate the stroke aetiology was conducted, and the relevant findings are discussed below in relation to each differential diagnosis.

### Autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndromes and liver pathology [^116d5DAe]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) may have an atypical serum alkaline phosphatase elevation, antimitochondrial antibodies, histologic features of bile duct injury/loss, or cholangiographic findings of focal biliary strictures and dilations. These manifestations characterize the overlap syndromes. Patients can be classified as having AIH with features of primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or a cholestatic syndrome. The gold standard of diagnosis is clinical judgment. Histologic evaluation is a major diagnostic component. Treatment is based on algorithms; outcomes vary depending on the predominant disease component. Combination therapy has been the principal recommendation.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^117XpUm1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^113mzzCB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase activity is also higher in patients with parathyroid carcinoma than in those with adenoma in whom serum levels are generally close to the upper limit of the normal range. α- and β-subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in patients with parathyroid cancer but not in those with benign tumors. Urinary hCG levels were found to be elevated in a small group of subjects with parathyroid carcinomas, in contrast to a control group of patients with benign PHPT. In particular, the elevated hCG isotype was the hyperglycosolated form of hCG that is specifically associated with malignancy in trophoblastic and nontrophoblastic diseases. Moreover, elevations of hCG might be predictive of complications such as hip fracture and death.

When benign PHPT presents with markedly elevated serum calcium concentrations and overt target organ involvement, a clinical phenotype that was historically common but is now infrequently seen in most countries, the clinical distinction between benign and malignant disease may be difficult. It is preferable to have a high index of suspicion particularly when concomitant kidney and bone disease are present than to miss the opportunity for surgical cure by failing to consider cancer in the differential diagnosis.

Acute PHPT, sometimes called "parathyroid crisis", shares many clinical features with parathyroid carcinoma. In view of the marked elevations of serum calcium and PTH that are common in parathyroid crisis, parathyroid cancer should be considered in any differential diagnosis of this condition. Parathyroid cancer should also be considered in any hypercalcemic patient without a history of prior neck surgery who presents with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis presented as peripheral eosinophilia in asymptomatic women with or without elevated alkaline phosphatase [^114kxqdJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by the destruction of biliary epithelial cells, presumably by autoimmune mechanism(s). Although lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PBC, the possible involvement of eosinophils has also been suggested. Recent studies have shown that eosinophilia possibly occurs in the peripheral blood of PBC patients. We present four cases of asymptomatic middle-aged women with moderate-to-high eosinophilia observed during random investigation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased in two of them. As a result of clinical and laboratory evaluations the early stages of PBC were diagnosed in all the patients, as attested by the detection of high titres of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and the characteristic lesions on liver biopsies. Liver function tests and eosinophils returned within normal limits after 2 months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, suggesting that its potential immunomodulatory actions may extend to eosinophils. Our report further supports the possibility that eosinophilia may occur in PBC, especially in its early stages. From the clinical point of view, we believe that PBC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of eosinophilia with an otherwise unknown origin. In particular, PBC should be suspected in a patient when other causes of eosinophilia have been excluded, irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms, or the presence or absence of elevated ALP. In such cases further evaluation for anti-mitochondrial antibodies should be done. These observations might assist the development of future therapeutic concepts in the management of PBC, at least for patients in early stages of the disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111amkCs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

Studies are needed to delineate the best screening test for hepatic sarcoidosis, such as alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases, or others. In addition, little is known about the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis. Case series demonstrate a broad range of disease outcomes, from spontaneous resolution to rapid progression to cirrhosis. Future studies should use long-term longitudinal follow-up to determine the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis and consider the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Better tools are needed to: 1) detect progression from hepatitis to early fibrosis and cirrhosis, such as liver elastography ultrasound; 2) more accurately characterize disease phenotypes; and 3) identify patients who might need and respond best to therapy.

Question 6: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Who Do Not Have Symptoms or Signs of Hypercalcemia Undergo Screening for Abnormal Calcium Metabolism by Routine Serum Calcium and Vitamin D Testing?

Rationale for question

Abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and their manifestations, including kidney stones and renal failure; it is the most common cause of sarcoidosis-related renal insufficiency. Dysfunctional calcium metabolism can also result in elevated bone resorption and increased renal and intestinal absorption of calcium. The mechanisms of abnormal calcium metabolism are likely multifactorial, including increased 1α‐hydroxylase production by granulomatous macrophages, which converts 25-(OH) vitamin D to 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D, increased expression of parathyroid hormone–related protein in sarcoidosis macrophages, and cytokine and other growth factor production. Although hypercalcemia- or hypercalciuria-related symptoms may bring the problem to attention, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis without symptoms should undergo screening for abnormal calcium metabolism by baseline serum calcium and vitamin D testing.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^1126UAag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Low serum alkaline phosphatase activity and pathologic fracture: case report and brief review of hypophosphatasia diagnosed in adulthood [^111TEned]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an elderly patient with low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity detected after a pathologic fracture and to characterize hypophosphatasia in adult patients.

Methods

We present a case report of a 64-year-old woman, who was referred after sustaining an atraumatic femoral fracture treated successfully with intramedullary nailing. Clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and molecular studies explore the differential diagnosis of her hypophosphatasemia, and the features, diagnosis, and management of the adult form of hypophosphatasia are reviewed.

Results

Physical examination of our patient was revealing only for short stature. Bone mineral density evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was unremarkable. Biochemical investigations showed normal calcium, elevated inorganic phosphate, and low ALP levels in serum. In light of the hypophosphatasemia and pathologic fracture, the serum pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration was measured and found to be considerably elevated, a substantiation of the diagnosis of hypophosphatasia. Analysis of the gene encoding the "tissue-nonspecific" isoenzyme of ALP (TNSALP) demonstrated a novel, heterozygous, missense mutation causing her disorder.

Conclusion

Hypophosphatasia is a rare inborn error of metabolism due to a deactivating mutation (or mutations) of the gene encoding TNSALP, in turn leading to global deficiency of TNSALP activity and inadequate skeletal mineralization and fractures. Our patient illustrates the importance of low serum ALP activity in the assessment of patients with fractures. No established treatment exists for hypophosphatasia, but the correct diagnosis should help to avoid the use of traditional therapies for osteoporosis or osteomalacia, which would be ineffective or potentially harmful.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

How is PSC diagnosed?

Consensus diagnostic criteria for PSC have been published as a workshop summary on behalf of the American College of Gastroenterology. Consensus guidelines relating to IgG4-SC, the biliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and on PSC/AIH variant syndrome, have also been published. A summary is outlined in figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the management of suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Modes of presentation

Symptoms are rare in early disease. In more established cases, symptoms such as right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, fever and weight loss are present in 47–56% of patients. Patients usually present in one of several ways: (i) no symptoms or signs but with an incidental finding of abnormal liver biochemistry, (ii) biochemical screening of patients with newly diagnosed or pre-existing IBD, (iii) jaundice and pruritus secondary to cholestasis, (iv) cholangitis, (v) jaundice secondary to liver failure, (vi) variceal bleeding and/or ascites from portal hypertension or (vii) cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

Blood tests

Serum liver biochemistry tests are abnormal in approximately 75% of patients with PSC. The most common pattern is of a cholestatic picture with raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. An elevated serum bilirubin is reported to be present in 28–40% and is a marker of poor prognosis, but this is likely to be an overestimate with more advanced cases reported by published series. An elevated ALP is a sensitive marker for diagnosis but is not specific. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often mildly raised and do not necessarily suggest additional features of autoimmune hepatitis. As with other causes of liver disease, a raised AST > ALT may be an indicator of cirrhosis and poor prognosis. Other indicators of cirrhosis or portal hypertension include an elevated prothrombin time or international normalised ratio, low albumin and low platelets. There are no autoantibodies diagnostic of PSC. Serum perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody is positive in 33–88% of those with PSC but is not specific and is not related to disease activity or prognosis.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 × ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 × ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^116sUSJP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Cholestatic liver disease — interpretation of nutritional biomarkers and vitamins emphasizes that Vitamin K deficiency (VKD) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic bone disease in cholestatic patients, even in those with a normal INR, and that Plasma PIVKA-II (protein induced in vitamin K absence) levels may assist in determining VKD; however, this assay is not widely available in the clinical setting. For vitamin D deficiency (VDD), If VDD is suspected, further work-up including measurement of serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate levels may be indicated. For zinc status, Zinc circulates bound to albumin; therefore, low serum albumin and zinc levels are used to screen for deficiency, which may be associated with hair loss and skin desquamation, and since zinc is required for alkaline phosphatase synthesis, low alkaline phosphatase levels may be suggestive of zinc deficiency; however, Alkaline phosphatase levels should, however, be interpreted with caution in patients with cholestasis and/or bone disease, which cause elevations in this biomarker. A directive on this page states that Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the limitations of nutritional biomarkers in the context of chronic liver disease.

Diagnosis

There is no gold standard for diagnosing PMR, and unlike many other rheumatic syndromes, there are no specific clinical manifestations, serology or other laboratory findings in PMR. As a result, diagnosis of PMR can be challenging with a considerable number of conditions in the list of differential diagnoses. However, in daily practice, the diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on the following combination of principles: new‐onset symptoms of both morning stiffness and pain in the shoulder and pelvis girdle in a person aged 50 years or older, evidence of systemic inflammation with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and or CRP, no other disease that would explain the clinical presentation better and finally abrupt response to GCs. In some diagnostic criteria, there are other specific requirements, such as a 2‐week duration of symptoms or negative tests for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.

The diagnosis of PMR should be considered clinically. The typical case is an elderly woman with early morning bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness. Similar symptoms often occur in the pelvic girdle. Typically, the symptoms ease during the day. Systemic manifestations such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss may occur in about a third of the patients. In addition, there is almost always an elevation of inflammatory parameters, especially ESR and/or CRP. Other inflammatory parameters can be elevated as white blood cell or platelet count and sometimes liver enzymes or alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as a sign of systemic inflammation. On clinical examination, tenderness with deep palpation of the muscles around the shoulders and thighs is often noted. In addition, there is usually restricted mobility in the shoulders, without muscle atrophy or weakness. Occasional signs of synovitis in the shoulders, wrist joints and the knees can be seen. PMR can be diagnosed in combination with GCA, especially in those with a cranial phenotype, that is, TA. Although temporal biopsy may be positive in a minority of patients with PMR, it is not included in the currently recommended investigation of the disease, unless there are concomitant cranial GCA symptoms. Finally, in PMR, most patients will respond rapidly and dramatically to GCs and according to some criteria, this response is required for diagnosis.

Caffey disease, also known as Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis, is a rare yet significant self-limiting disorder that primarily affects infants. The condition is characterised by acute inflammation of the periosteum, cortical hyperostosis, and soft tissue swelling, often accompanied by systemic manifestations such as fever and irritability. The case describes a male infant with progressive left thigh swelling appearing 10 days post-immunisation, with no systemic symptoms. Examination revealed a bony-hard swelling with elevated inflammatory markers and alkaline phosphatase. Radiographs showed cortical thickening, and biopsy confirmed Caffey disease (Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis). Differential diagnoses like osteomyelitis and malignancy were ruled out. Conservative management with symptomatic relief led to complete resolution within 3months, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis to avoid unnecessary interventions.

### A patient with extensive cerebral calcification due to pseudohypoparathyroidism: a case report [^113c7Yye]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Differential diagnoses in this patient who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia were hypoparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism due to long standing vitamin D deficiency, PTH resistance due to magnesium deficiency and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Elevated serum intact PTH level narrowed down the differentials to the latter three diagnoses. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was considered unlikely in the absence of conditions leading to longstanding vitamin D deficiency such as chronic kidney disease, gastric or intestinal surgery and chronic diarrhoea suggestive of Chron's disease or celiac disease. Severe hypocalcaemia and high PTH level couldn't be explained solely by marginally low (insufficient) Vitamin D level. Although severe hypomagnesemia is well known to cause hypocalcaemia through a combination of defective PTH secretion and some degree of PTH resistance mild hypomagnesemia is unlikely to cause isolated PTH resistance leading to such severe hypocalcaemia. Also cerebral calcification can't be explained by hypomagnesemia alone. The presence of severe hypocalcaemia and elevated PTH with a marginally low vitamin D level and especially the basal, thalamic and dentate ganglia calcification suggests the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Although PHP presenting at 59 years of age is uncommon there have been previous reports of adults presenting with symptomatic hypocalcaemia due to PHP.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase is thought to be due to development of osteomalacia secondary to reduced conversion of 25- hydroxyvitamin D to its active form i.e. 1, 25- dihydroxyvitamin D in the absence of PTH action and concurrent vitamin D deficiency.

The radiological findings of basal ganglia calcification seen in this case are well described in PHP. However cortical calcification is a rare finding and this is the first such report from Sri Lanka. Other differential diagnoses for this presentation are familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr's disease), neoplastic, vascular, infectious, and congenital causes, as well as other endocrine/metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. However hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and increased PTH seen in this patient favor the diagnosis of PHP.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score, the UK-PSC score, and the PREsTO score. However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature. In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown. Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

Differential laboratory findings corroborate differential associations between comorbidities and delirium

We also conducted enrichment analysis for median laboratory values and vital signs collected before the inpatient admission of interest. Patients with a delirium diagnosis had significantly higher median values of certain liver function tests, such as alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transferase, compared to controls in both UCSF and UC-wide datasets, suggesting potential liver dysfunction in these patients (Fig. 3a). Elevated median vital signs included heart rate and respiratory rate (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, glomerular filtration rate and urine creatinine levels were decreased in patients with delirium compared to controls, consistent with kidney dysfunction (Fig. 3a). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte counts were also significantly decreased in patients with delirium compared to controls, consistent with the association with an anemia diagnosis in these patients (Fig. 3). The UC-wide dataset also captured certain clinical test scores, including results from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 and PHQ-9, consistent with the associations with depression in these patients (Supplementary Data 5).

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^116jVVbP]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

Paget's disease — biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget's disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Management of syphilitic hepatitis [^117XxmpS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a sexuality transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum. Liver involvement is very rarely seen and occurs in the second phase of the disease. Syphilitic hepatitis generally is mild clinical condition and is characterized by high serum alkaline phosphatase level, often with normal or only slightly abnormal transaminases. The skin eruptions are classically diffuse, symmetric maculopapular rashes involving trunk and extremities. Involvement of palms and soles is a strong clue to the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Therefore, syphilitic hepatitis should be included in the early differential diagnosis in patient with abnormal liver enzyme, especially increased alkaline phosphatase, and rashes involving palms and soles.

Case Description: A 14-year-old female presented with chronic, bilateral, activity-related knee pain persisting for over a year. Symptoms lacked inflammatory features such as swelling, warmth or morning stiffness. Initial sonography was unremarkable and MRI findings indicated tibial and femoral bone marrow edema, consistent with a stress reaction. Despite extensive workup, no rheumatologic diagnosis was established.

Over time, the patient experienced pain and swelling in her hand after minor trauma. An external X-ray identified a cystic lesion, prompting re-evaluation by a pediatric radiologist. Imaging revealed severe osteopenia, subperiosteal bone resorption and acroosteolysis, hallmark findings of hyperparathyroidism. MRI findings confirmed the presence of a brown tumor. Laboratory tests supported the diagnosis, showing elevated calcium (3.6 mmol/L; normal 2.2–2.6), low phosphate (0.8 mmol/L; normal 1.0–1.5), markedly elevated PTH (111 pmol/L; normal 1.6–6.9), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (17 µkat/L; normal 1.1–6.5). Neck ultrasound identified a parathyroid adenoma, which was histologically confirmed after surgical excision. Postoperatively, serum calcium normalized and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improved skeletal mineralization. Symptoms, including the brown tumor, resolved.

Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering metabolic disorders like primary hyperparathyroidism in the differential diagnosis of unexplained bone and joint pain. Early detection through basic laboratory tests such as serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase can significantly expedite diagnosis and treatment. Revisiting imaging studies with a focus on metabolic patterns is crucial for recognizing rare conditions. Incorporating routine metabolic assessments into the diagnostic workup for persistent bone pain is a simple yet effective strategy to prevent diagnostic delays and optimize outcomes in conditions such as osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Management of Paget's disease.

Although we have made recommendations in 12 areas and conditional recommendations in five, the GDG noted that for several outcomes of clinical importance to patients, there was insufficient evidence to answer the questions posed in this guideline due to the fact that most clinical trials in PDB had been short term and focused on biochemical markers as the primary outcome, rather than patient‐reported outcome measures. Accordingly, the GDG felt that further research into PDB is warranted and identified the following topics as areas where research would be warranted (Table 29).

### Benign prenatal hypophosphatasia: a treatable disease not to be missed [^1156azoQ]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prenatal bowing of the long bones is often associated with severe bone dysplasias. We report a child who presented marked bowing of the long bones at birth but showed a relatively benign postnatal course with spontaneous improvement of bowing. The fetal imaging showed normal skeletal mineralization and normal chest and abdominal circumferences despite the limb bowing and shortening. Decreased serum alkaline phosphatase activity and elevated urine phosphoethanolamine was biochemically evident, and compound heterozygous mutations in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene were identified, which confirmed the diagnosis of a benign form of prenatal hypophosphatasia. Benign prenatal hypophosphatasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital bowing of the long bones.

### Cholestatic phenotypes of autoimmune hepatitis [^112Gr5vu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis can have cholestatic features that are outside the codified diagnostic criteria. These features have uncertain effects on the clinical presentation and progression of disease. Patients with autoimmune hepatitis can have antimitochondrial antibodies and coincidental bile duct injury or loss (2%-13% of patients), focal biliary strictures and dilations based on cholangiography (2%-11%), or histologic changes of bile duct injury or loss in the absence of other features (5%-11%). These findings probably represent atypical manifestations of autoimmune hepatitis or variants of primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis, depending on the predominant findings. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transferase, histologic features of bile duct injury, and findings from cholangiography are associated with responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and individualized alternative treatments. Corticosteroid therapy, in combination with low-dose ursodeoxycholic acid, has been promulgated by international societies, but these recommendations are not based on strong evidence. The frequency, variable outcomes, and uncertainties in diagnosis and management of the cholestatic phenotypes must be addressed by a collaborative investigational network. This network should define the genetic and pathologic features of these disorders, standardize their nomenclature, and establish a treatment algorithm. In this review, the different cholestatic phenotypes of autoimmune hepatitis, mechanisms of pathogenesis, current management strategies and outcomes, and opportunities for improving understanding and therapy are presented.

### Transient benign hyperphophatasemia [^115XLydM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Sometimes, a temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase level is found in healthy infants and toddlers without evidence of liver or bone disease. The condition is customarily termed transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood. Most textbooks do not refer to the condition. The aim of the study was to promote broader awareness of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia.

Methods

We completed a systematic review of the literature using the principles underlying the UK Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.

Results

The 142 reports retained for analysis included 813 cases (male:female ratio 1.1:1.0): 80 in subjects older than 18 years and 733 in subjects 18 years or younger. The alkaline phosphatase ratio, calculated by dividing the measured level by the upper limit of normal, was ≥ 5.0 in ≈70% and the duration of the elevation was ≤ 4 months in 80% of the cases. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia often followed a benign infection, but available data fail to demonstrate a causal link. The prevalence of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia ranged from 1.1% to 3.5% in infants 2 to 24 months of age.

Conclusions

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is likely the most common cause of hyperphosphatasemia among healthy infants and toddlers. Sometimes it also occurs in older children and adults, indicating that the traditional term transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood may not be correct. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase persists for > 4 months in ≈20% of the cases. Recognition of this benign condition is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^114yEgau]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — clinical features and diagnostic markers: PBC is a chronic intrahepatic cholestatic disease that typically affects middle-aged women and presents with fatigue and pruritus or with asymptomatic elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), especially the M2 subtype (AMA-M2), are described as highly sensitive and specific for PBC in clinical settings, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is noted as the treatment of choice for this disease.

### Hepatitis in patients with syphilis: an overlooked association [^114sMZGn]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We present the case of a patient who sought treatment for fever and a maculopapular rash involving the trunk, limbs, palms and soles. The patient also presented with hepatomegaly and elevated levels of liver enzymes (with a higher increase of alkaline phosphatase). With the proposal of early syphilitic hepatitis, during the stage of secondary syphilis, a venereal disease research laboratory and Treponema pallidum haemagglutination tests were requested, which confirmed the diagnosis. All altered parameters improved with antibiotic treatment for secondary syphilis. Syphilitic hepatitis is an often overlooked presentation of syphilis and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes and risk factors for syphilis.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112YHG7F]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

### Generalized lymphatic anomaly and gorham-stout disease: overview and recent insights [^111TJkMp]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Characteristics of complex lymphatic anomalies and their differential features

There is a need to rule out other osteolytic diseases in the differential diagnosis of GSD. Idiopathic multicentric osteolysis, multicentric osteolysis, hereditary multicentric osteolysis, neurogenic osteolysis, and osteolysis due to neoplastic, infectious, and immunological diseases should be considered before reaching a final diagnosis. A series of laboratory investigations were carried out, but they failed to detect osteolysis secondary to pathology (cyst, tumor, and infection), metabolic and endocrinal disorders, neoplastic disease, trauma, and/or connective tissue disorders. A recent case report showed the elevation of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and serum CTX-1 in a GSD patient; the patient showed rapidly decreasing levels of BAP and CTX-1 after bisphosphonate therapy. Another report showed the elevation of serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase before bisphosphonate therapy. At initial assessment, the elevation of serum IL-6 was found, but the level of IL-6 normalized after 6 months of bisphosphonate treatment. In contrast, the levels of the osteoclastic regulators OPG, free soluble RANKL, and OPG/free RANKL ratio were increased. In GLA and KLA patients, serum angiopoietin 1 and 2 levels were found to be useful for their diagnosis and suitable as biomarkers for drug treatment. In terms of new radiological methods, Papadakis reported thatF sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT), which is used for detecting skeletal metastatic disease, is useful for GSD diagnosis and follow-up. However, the findings obtained by these methods are only speculative, preventing definitive conclusions from being drawn.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^115BjhFk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — oncologic etiologies and diagnostic considerations are outlined: Hematological malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, can rarely present with ALF, and diagnostic clues for hematological malignancies include high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood film abnormalities. A bone marrow examination may be diagnostic, and acute hepatic failure can also occur after metastatic liver infiltration due to neuroblastoma or other solid tumors. Evaluation of liver histology may be needed, despite the risk of bleeding in patients with coagulopathies, and it is essential to consider malignant infiltration of the liver given the clear contraindication of liver transplantation, which could otherwise be lifesaving in failure due to other etiologies.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^111g4yEa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### A case report of severe calciphylaxis-suggested approach for diagnosis and treatment [^112veuuk]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a serious complication in patients with chronic kidney disease associated mineral and bone disorder. It can occur in conditions with low and high bone turnover. So far, there are no definite diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines which may prevent the devastating outcome in many calciphylaxis patients. We report a case which clearly illustrates that knowledge of the underlying bone disorder is essential for a directed treatment. Based on this experience we discuss a systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in patients with calciphylaxis.

Case Presentation

We report a patient with severe calciphylaxis. Initial evaluation showed an elevated serum parathormone concentration and a bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity in the upper normal range; however, the bone biopsy clearly showed adynamic bone disease. Extended dialysis with low calcium dialysate concentration and citrate anticoagulation, and administration of teriparatide led to a further increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity and most importantly, resulted in an activated bone turnover as confirmed by a second bone biopsy 11 weeks later.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that laboratory tests cannot reliably differentiate between high and low bone turnover in calciphylaxis patients. More importantly, this case highlights the fact that specific therapies that alter bone metabolism cannot be applied without knowledge of the bone status. On this background, we suggest that bone biopsies should be an integral part in the diagnosis and therapeutic decision in these patients and should be evaluated in further studies.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112zmSbv]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases primary biliary cholangitis — diagnosis criteria and biopsy considerations state that the diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of three criteria are met: biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation, presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) or other PBC-specific autoantibodies including sp100 or gp210 if AMA is negative, and histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis with destruction of interlobular bile ducts; similarly, the diagnostic approach is generally based on at least two criteria including ALP elevation, AMA presence, and histopathologic evidence if biopsy is performed, and with a positive AMA the role of liver biopsy is described as questionable when ALP activity is at least 1.5 times the normal and aspartate aminotransferase values are less than 5 times the normal, although biopsy may be occasionally recommended in AMA-negative patients and to exclude other concomitant diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
