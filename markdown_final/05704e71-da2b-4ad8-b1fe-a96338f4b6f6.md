## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acne vulgaris management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the disease definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and burden to frame clinical urgency. Next, I will classify severity and morphology to guide therapy. After that, I need to outline first-line topical therapies and when to escalate to systemic options. I should confirm antibiotic stewardship principles and resistance mitigation. Then, I will review hormonal therapies for women and isotretinoin indications. I will also examine procedural and light-based therapies, special populations, adherence and maintenance, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm while noting evidence gaps and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and pathophysiology so I don't anchor on outdated notions. Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit driven by four interacting pillars: increased sebum production influenced by androgens, abnormal follicular keratinization with microcomedo formation, Cutibacterium acnes colonization and strain-level effects, and innate/adaptive immune-mediated inflammation; newer data also implicate neuropeptides and the skin microbiome, which helps explain heterogeneity and treatment variability [^112DMEmP] [^115z9LLV] [^115j6bjy].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and burden to calibrate treatment thresholds. Acne affects roughly 85% of adolescents and about 9% of the global population, with substantial psychosocial morbidity including anxiety, depression, and suicidality; scarring occurs in up to 20% of teenagers, and direct U.S. costs exceed $3 billion annually, underscoring the need for early, effective therapy to prevent sequelae [^112Xxf2c] [^116Va5KA] [^114htwt7].

> Hold on, I should verify severity classification because treatment choice hinges on it. There is no universally accepted grading system, but clinicians commonly categorize acne as mild, moderate, or severe based on lesion type and count, with attention to scarring and psychosocial impact; morphologies include comedonal, papulopustular, nodulocystic, and mixed, and documenting these elements improves treatment selection and monitoring of response [^112yp3ej] [^1172GXSG] [^112CYLLY].

> I will now examine first-line topical therapies, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with high-quality guidance. Topical retinoids are foundational because they normalize keratinization and are anti-inflammatory; benzoyl peroxide provides bactericidal activity and mitigates resistance; fixed-dose combinations of retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide or retinoid plus antibiotic plus benzoyl peroxide are preferred over monotherapy for faster, greater clearance; topical antibiotics should never be used alone due to resistance risk and should be paired with benzoyl peroxide when used [^115VPeci] [^113GESw5] [^115osGxh].

> Let me consider escalation to systemic therapy carefully, and I should double-check the resistance implications. For moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne, oral tetracyclines such as doxycycline or sarecycline are recommended, but never as monotherapy; they must be combined with topical retinoids and/or benzoyl peroxide, and duration should be limited to about 3 months when possible to reduce resistance; isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodulocystic disease, scarring, treatment failure, or significant psychosocial burden, and is the most effective single agent for durable remission [^1162UVfh] [^116uBu43] [^115UTVrt].

> Wait, I should verify antibiotic stewardship specifics so I don't overgeneralize. Guidelines emphasize avoiding antibiotic monotherapy, limiting oral antibiotic duration, and always pairing antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide to curb C. acnes resistance; routine microbiologic testing is not recommended except when Gram-negative folliculitis is suspected, which presents with sudden worsening after prolonged oral antibiotics and warrants culture and management adjustments [^116uBu43] [^112aBRji] [^116ThiuK].

> Next, I should review hormonal therapies for women, and I need to check where clascoterone fits. Combined oral contraceptives and spironolactone are effective anti-androgen options for women with persistent inflammatory acne; clascoterone, a first-in-class topical anti-androgen, offers a localized androgen receptor blockade and can be useful across severities, though I should confirm patient selection and counseling on onset and expectations [^1162UVfh] [^115r98L1].

> I will now examine isotretinoin optimization, and I should confirm dosing and monitoring nuances. Standard dosing is 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day to a cumulative 120–150 mg/kg, with attention to triglycerides, liver enzymes, mood screening, and strict pregnancy prevention; low-dose regimens can be considered in select scenarios but may have higher relapse, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential [^115UTVrt] [^114fZZki].

> But wait, what about procedural and light-based therapies? I should verify the certainty of evidence before recommending them. Chemical peels and combined blue-red light may help mild-to-moderate acne, while photodynamic therapy shows signals of benefit in moderate-to-severe disease; however, Cochrane and related reviews highlight low-to-very low certainty evidence, heterogeneity in devices and protocols, and limited long-term data, so these are best positioned as adjuncts or when conventional therapy is contraindicated or declined [^114iXepC] [^1153NjFm] [^115cAkoT].

> Let me think about special populations, and I should confirm pediatric and skin-of-color considerations. In pediatrics, classify by morphology and severity, avoid systemic antibiotics in young children unless clearly indicated, and consider isotretinoin for severe scarring or refractory disease. In skin of color, anticipate higher risks of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloidal scarring, and favor gentle topical regimens with early attention to dyspigmentation and scarring prevention [^113A76pN] [^116Va5KA].

> I need to ensure adherence and maintenance are addressed because nonadherence derails outcomes. Patients often stop early due to irritation or delayed response. Counseling that topicals require 6–8 weeks for visible benefit and providing written instructions improve persistence. Maintenance with topical retinoids, with or without benzoyl peroxide, is recommended after inflammatory control to prevent relapse [^111sXWYh] [^112JvwJq].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical treatment algorithm so it's actionable. For mild comedonal disease, start a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide. For mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne, use a fixed-dose retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide combination. For moderate-to-severe disease, add an oral tetracycline to topical retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide for about 3 months, then taper the antibiotic and continue topicals. For severe nodulocystic or scarring acne, proceed to isotretinoin. Throughout, tailor to lesion type, scarring risk, psychosocial impact, and patient preference [^113GESw5] [^1162UVfh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge evidence gaps and uncertainties so we don't overstate benefits. Comparative effectiveness across topical classes is limited, light therapies lack high-certainty data, and many trials focus on facial acne, leaving truncal disease underrepresented; cost-effectiveness varies by health system, and standardization of grading and outcomes remains an ongoing challenge that complicates meta-analyses and guideline synthesis [^115NR4VL] [^115cAkoT] [^111u9x2K] [^111pW6v7] [^1172GXSG].

> In summary, I should confirm that the core principles remain: acne is a chronic inflammatory disease requiring multimodal therapy targeting multiple pathogenic factors, with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide as foundational agents, judicious and time-limited antibiotic use with resistance mitigation, hormonal therapy for appropriate women, isotretinoin for severe or refractory disease, and maintenance regimens to sustain control. Aligning with contemporary AAD and international guidelines while individualizing care yields the best outcomes and minimizes scarring and psychosocial harm [^1162UVfh] [^114htwt7].

Acne vulgaris is a **chronic inflammatory skin disease** of the pilosebaceous unit [^115z9LLV], characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts, and driven by four core mechanisms: **increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes proliferation, and inflammation** [^112DMEmP] [^117DEezS]. It typically affects adolescents and young adults, with a global prevalence of about 9% [^115n7XHz] and substantial psychosocial and scarring burden [^114htwt7]. Management is **severity-based**: topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide for mild disease [^115TrYKP]; topical combinations or oral antibiotics for moderate disease [^115TrYKP]; and oral isotretinoin for severe or refractory cases [^1162UVfh]. Antibiotic stewardship is essential to limit resistance [^116uBu43], and maintenance therapy helps prevent relapse [^115TrYKP].

---

## Pathophysiology

Acne vulgaris arises from **interplay among four pathogenic factors**:

- **Increased sebum production**: Androgens stimulate sebaceous glands, causing hyperseborrhea [^112DMEmP] [^114htwt7].

- **Follicular hyperkeratinization**: Abnormal keratinization leads to microcomedones and follicular obstruction [^115Aj4Dm].

- **Cutibacterium acnes proliferation**: C. acnes colonizes lipid-rich, blocked follicles, promoting inflammation [^115j6bjy].

- **Inflammation**: Innate and adaptive immune responses drive lesion progression and scarring [^115z9LLV].

---

## Clinical presentation

Acne vulgaris presents with **lesions on the face, chest, and back** [^116Va5KA]:

| **Lesion type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Comedones | Open (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) |
| Papules | Small, red, tender inflammatory lesions |
| Pustules | Pus-filled inflammatory lesions |
| Nodules | Large, deep, painful lesions |
| Cysts | Large, fluctuant, often scarring lesions |

---

Severity is **classified as mild, moderate, or severe** based on lesion count, type, and scarring [^112yp3ej] [^112CYLLY].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Acne vulgaris affects approximately **9% of the global population** [^112DMEmP], with a peak prevalence in adolescents and young adults [^1132g3WX]. Risk factors include hormonal fluctuations, genetic predisposition, certain medications, and environmental factors [^112DMEmP].

---

## Psychological and social impact

Acne vulgaris significantly impairs **quality of life**, causing anxiety, depression, and reduced self-esteem [^116Va5KA]. It can lead to social isolation and negatively impact academic and professional performance [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment is **tailored to severity, lesion type, and patient factors**:

- **Topical therapies**: Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, and azelaic acid are first-line for mild acne [^115VPeci] [^115TrYKP].

- **Systemic therapies**: Oral antibiotics, hormonal therapies (combined oral contraceptives, spironolactone), and oral isotretinoin are used for moderate-to-severe acne [^1162UVfh] [^115n7XHz].

- **Combination therapy**: Combining topical and systemic therapies enhances efficacy and reduces resistance [^115Vfmg9] [^116uBu43].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Topical retinoids with or without benzoyl peroxide are recommended to prevent relapse [^112JvwJq].

---

## Antibiotic resistance and stewardship

Antibiotic resistance in C. acnes is a **growing concern** [^116uBu43]. Guidelines emphasize antibiotic stewardship: avoid monotherapy, limit duration, and combine with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids [^1153Zszz].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent advances include topical anti-androgens (clascoterone), novel retinoids, and biologics targeting inflammatory pathways. These therapies offer promising options for refractory acne and for minimizing antibiotic use [^115r98L1] [^1132g3WX].

---

Acne vulgaris is a **multifactorial inflammatory skin disease** with significant psychosocial impact [^112DMEmP]. Effective management requires **severity-based therapy**, antibiotic stewardship, and maintenance strategies to prevent relapse and scarring [^112ZDptp] [^115TrYKP] [^111sXWYh].

### South-east Asia study alliance guidelines on the management of acne vulgaris in south-east Asian patients [^116t5ATM]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of acne in South-East Asia is unique, as Asian skin and local variables require a clinical approach unlike that utilized in other parts of the world. There are different treatment guidelines per country in the region, and a group of leading dermatologists from these countries convened to review these guidelines, discuss current practices and recent advances, and formulate consensus guidelines to harmonize the management of acne vulgaris in the region. Emphasis has been placed on formulating recommendations to impede the development of antibiotic resistance in Propionibacterium acnes. The group adopted the Acne Consensus Conference system for grading acne severity. The group recommends that patients may be treated with topical medications including retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), salicylic acid, a combination of retinoid and BPO, or a combination of retinoids and BPO with or without antibiotics for mild acne; topical retinoid with topical BPO and a oral antibiotic for moderate acne; and oral isotretinoin if the patient fails first-line treatment (a 6- or 8-week trial of combined oral antibiotics and topical retinoids with BPO) for severe acne. Maintenance acne treatment using topical retinoids with or without BPO is recommended. To prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy or used simultaneously with oral antibiotics. Skin care, comprised of cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection, is likewise recommended. Patient education and good communication is recommended to improve adherence, and advice should be given about the characteristics of the skin care products patients should use.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HLtTy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globallyand a common presentation to dermatologists. Acne may have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. A network meta‐analysis (NMA), assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments, found that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying treatment costs, including drug acquisition, time of the healthcare professional [HCP; general practitioner (GP) or specialist dermatologist] and special equipment. Evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of acne treatments is currently lacking. Thus, our study objective was to examine the cost‐effectiveness of effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using decision–analytical economic modelling.

This economic analysis informed the development of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of acne in England.NICE considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national guidance for health and social care services. The guideline was developed by a committee of clinical academics, HCPs and service users with expertise and experience in acne. The committee contributed to the development of the economic model by providing advice on the natural history of acne and its treatment patterns in England, and on model assumptions where evidence was lacking.

Acne vulgaris is a common disorder that affects more than 17 million individuals in the United States. Knowledge of the disease is an important part of clinical practice, particularly for the pediatric practitioner. Contrary to common belief, acne is not a disease limited to adolescents and young adults but can occur at any stage of life. This article is a case-based review of acne during childhood and adolescence. Workup is based on age and concurrent physical findings, whereas therapy depends on the type of skin lesions along with patient characteristics and preferences.

### Abstract… [^115Aj4Dm]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1 Subsequent hyperkeratinization of the hair follicle prevents normal shedding of the follicular keratinocytes, which then obstruct the follicle and form an inapparent microcomedo. 2 Lipids and cellular debris soon accumulate within the blocked follicle. This microenvironment encourages colonization of Propionibacterium acnes, which provokes an immune response through the production of numerous inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is further enhanced by follicular rupture and subsequent leakage of lipids, bacteria, and fatty acids into the dermis. Diagnosis The diagnosis of acne is based on the history and physical examination. Lesions most commonly develop in areas with the greatest concentration of sebaceous glands, which include the face, neck, chest, upper arms, and back. Acne vulgaris may be defined as any disorder of the skin whose initial pathology is the microscopic microcomedo.

3 The microcomedo may evolve into visible open comedones or closed comedones. Subsequently, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules may develop. Nodulocystic acne consists of pustular lesions larger than 0. 5 cm. The presence of excoriations, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scars should be noted. Classification In 1990, the American Academy of Dermatology developed a classification scheme for primary acne vulgaris. 7 This grading scale delineates three levels of acne: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild acne is characterized by the presence of few to several papules and pustules, but no nodules. Patients with moderate acne have several to many papules and pustules, along with a few to several nodules. With severe acne, patients have numerous or extensive papules and pustules, as well as many nodules. Acne also is classified by type of lesion — comedonal, papulopustular, and nodulocystic.

Pustules and cysts are considered inflammatory acne. Referral The patient who has not responded to treatment as expected may need to be referred to a dermatologist. Gram-negative folliculitis should be suspected if inflammatory acne worsens after several months of oral antibiotic therapy. Acne fulminans is the rapid onset of severe, inflammatory acne, often accompanied by fever, arthralgia, and bone diathesis.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^115Vfmg9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### Pediatric acne: clinical presentations, evaluation, and management [^111UpEud]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris can be easy to diagnose yet difficult to evaluate and manage, especially when it presents in infancy and childhood. The differential diagnosis of acne varies by age and, in some cases, may warrant a work-up in order to rule out underlying systemic abnormalities. Likewise, treatment strategies can be influenced by the patient's age. In this article, we present an overview of the clinical presentations of acne by age, an approach to patient evaluation, and a general strategy for management of this common and important disease.

### Low-dose oral isotretinoin for the treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fZZki]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic complaints. Recently, isotretinoin has been used as an off-label indication for the treatment of mild-to-moderate grades of acne not responding to conventional treatment. Its conventional recommended dose is 0.5–1.0 mg/kg per day to the cumulative dose of 120–150mg/kg. To qualify the state of evidence and analyze the efficacy of the low-daily dose and the pulsed doses of isotretinoin in treating mild-to-moderate acne patients with regards to response and relapse rates. Systematic review and meta-analysis using an electronic literature search were performed. The 320 potentially relevant articles were included and reviewed. The level of evidence is moderate to low as conducted by the GRADE quality of evidence assessment. The pooled statistical estimate for response to treatment in the group comparing low-daily doses with conventional dose showed an overall benefit for conventional dose. On the other hand, pooled data from the group comparing the low-daily dose with the pulsed doses yielded an overall beneficial effect from using the low-daily dose compared with the pulsed doses on achieving the response. Given all of the available studies, the quality of evidence is low. It appears that conventional dose isotretinoin improves the odds of prolonged remission in adults with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris compared to the low doses.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115SANvA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0·5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### Clinical considerations in the treatment of acne vulgaris and other inflammatory skin disorders: a status report [^114Ht9GP]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the anti-inflammatory and nonantimicrobial effects of antibiotics in acne and other diseases and examines issues relating to the emergence of decreased bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics and how these issues relate to clinical practice. It includes an overview of the inflammatory activities of some antibiotic agents and their potential for use in various dermatologic and nondermatologic diseases. It demonstrates that P. acnes-resistant organisms may be associated with therapeutic failure in some patients with acne, and that the prudent use of antibiotics is necessary to ensure that we can continue to use these drugs to combat disease effectively. It concludes that there are treatment strategies that can effectively minimize the potential for development of resistant P. acnes organisms.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^115r98L1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

### Is antibiotic resistance in cutaneous propionibacteria clinically relevant? implications of resistance for acne patients and prescribers [^1116NT43]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that some patients with acne do not respond adequately to antibiotic therapy. It is important to distinguish antibiotic recalcitrant acne which we would suggest represents acne that shows a diminished response to treatment irrespective of the cause as opposed to 'antibiotic-resistant acne' which is acne that is less responsive to treatment as a direct consequence of skin colonization with resistant propionibacteria. Here we show that antibiotic-resistant acne is not just a theoretical possibility but a real phenomenon that could have important consequences for patients and prescribers. The relationship between skin colonization by antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria and treatment outcomes is a complex one that is explained at the follicular level by physiological differences affecting local drug concentrations. A systematic review of the literature on antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria revealed methodological shortcomings in studies of their prevalence and a paucity of evidence on their clinical significance. Despite the elucidation of resistance mechanisms in cutaneous propionibacteria, our continuing inability to distinguish between strains of Propionibacterium acnes means that we still do not fully understand how resistance spreads, although person-to-person transfer is most likely. Finally, we present a decision tree for acne management in an era of prudent antimicrobial prescribing that provides an alternative to existing treatment algorithms by placing topical retinoids and not antibiotics at the cornerstone of acne management.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: antibiotic stewardship in acne: 2023 update [^112aBRji]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics, topical and oral, are a cornerstone in the treatment of acnes vulgaris specifically by targeting the skin bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Billions of individuals have received antibiotics as part of their treatment resulting in a worldwide pandemic of antibiotic resistance not only for C. acnes but also many other pathogens. With the increasing prevalence of acne and exponentially increasing utilization of antibiotics, prescribers must urgently embrace the notion of antibiotic stewardship to maintain the efficacy of acne treatments while attenuating the rise of resistance. This paper serves as an update on C. acnes resistance to antibiotics commonly employed in the treatment of acne and the necessity of implementing benzoyl peroxide in the treatment&nbsp; regimen as monotherapy or combination antibiotic therapies for overcoming and preventing resistance.

### Truncal acne and scarring: a comprehensive review of current medical and cosmetic approaches to treatment and patient management [^111BkGx4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disorders worldwide. It typically affects skin areas with a high density of sebaceous glands such as the face, upper arms, chest, and/or back. Historically, the majority of research efforts have focused on facial acne vulgaris, even though approximately half of patients with facial lesions demonstrate truncal involvement. Truncal acne vulgaris is challenging to treat and poses a significant psychosocial burden on patients. Despite these characteristics, studies specifically examining truncal acne vulgaris are limited, with treatment guidelines largely derived from facial protocols. Therefore, truncal acne remains an understudied clinical problem. Here, we provide a clinically focused review on the epidemiology, evaluation, and available treatment options for truncal acne vulgaris. In doing so, we highlight knowledge gaps with the goal of spurring further investigation into the management of truncal acne vulgaris.

### Inflammatory acne treatment: review of current and new topical therapeutic options [^115aJNGH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by the presence of comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules. Consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy using different drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to best address as many acne pathogenic factors as possible at the same time. Topical acne medications exist as individual agents that may be combined in physician-recommended regimens or as pre-formulated fixed-dose combination products. In addition, there are several new and promising topical therapies currently being developed that work by different mechanisms of action from traditionally used acne therapies. The following review will cover commonly used drugs, newcomers to the market, and what the future holds for the topical treatment of AV.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^112ZDptp]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The diagnosis of acne is made on the clinical history and examination. There are no diagnostic criteria and the skin lesions seen are open comedones (whiteheads), closed comedones (blackheads), papules/nodules, cysts and scarring. There is no strong evidence base for different treatments for different acne subtypes (comedonal vs inflammatory), and NICE and most other guidelines provide different guidance on the basis of severity rather than acne subtypes. While classifications vary, the majority of acne is mild, with moderate or severe acne combined making up less than 15% of cases of acne. See table 2 for severity classifications and linked treatment choices.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116ThiuK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — microbiologic testing is addressed as follows: Routine microbiologic testing is not recommended in the evaluation and management of patients with acne, but those who exhibit acne-like lesions suggestive of Gram-negative folliculitis may benefit from microbiologic testing. Microbiologic testing of acne lesions is largely unnecessary because it does not affect management, and successful antibiotic treatment may not result from a reduction of bacterial numbers. The prime situation where microbiologic testing is useful in patients with acne is in evaluating for Gram-negative folliculitis, which is typically diagnosed via culture of the lesions, and is generally treated with isotretinoin or an antibiotic to which the bacteria are sensitive. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infections may appear similar to acne and should be considered in the differential, particularly in cases of acute eruptions; a swab culture may be helpful in these cases.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD… [^115TrYKP]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Antibiotics should be prescribed for the briefest possible time frame, and their use should be assessed after three to four months to reduce the risk of developing a resistance. As with topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics should not be used alone. To maintain results after antibiotic treatment has concluded, benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used. Severe adverse effects of systemic antibiotics in persons treated for acne are uncommon. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism.

### Acne vulgaris [^115z9LLV]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease - rather than a natural part of the life cycle as colloquially viewed - of the pilosebaceous unit (comprising the hair follicle, hair shaft and sebaceous gland) and is among the most common dermatological conditions worldwide. Some of the key mechanisms involved in the development of acne include disturbed sebaceous gland activity associated with hyperseborrhoea (that is, increased sebum production) and alterations in sebum fatty acid composition, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity. Grading of acne involves lesion counting and photographic methods. However, there is a lack of consensus on the exact grading criteria, which hampers the conduction and comparison of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating treatments. Prevention of acne relies on the successful management of modifiable risk factors, such as underlying systemic diseases and lifestyle factors. Several treatments are available, but guidelines suffer from a lack of data to make evidence-based recommendations. In addition, the complex combination treatment regimens required to target different aspects of acne pathophysiology lead to poor adherence, which undermines treatment success. Acne commonly causes scarring and reduces the quality of life of patients. New treatment options with a shift towards targeting the early processes involved in acne development instead of suppressing the effects of end products will enhance our ability to improve the outcomes for patients with acne.

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris [^112LPiES]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes.

Objective

To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004.

Study Selection

Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article.

Data Extraction

Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity.

Data Synthesis

Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.

### A microbial aetiology of acne: what is the evidence? [^114JvtrN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

A microbial aetiology of acne has been suggested since the beginning of the last century. There is considerable evidence, circumstantial at best, which suggests that micro-organisms, particularly Propionibacterium acnes, are important in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. However, it is still unclear whether P. acnes is actually a causal agent in the development of noninflamed or inflamed acne lesions. Based on a review of the microbiological data on normal and acne-affected skin, we propose that P. acnes neither initiates comedogenesis nor has a role in the initiation of inflammation in inflamed acne lesions.

### An algorithm integrating acneceuticals into the management of acne vulgaris [^116PVRne]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic cutaneous disorder with numerous efficacious prescription and procedural treatments. Therapy, however, is hampered by medication intolerability and compromised by non-adherence. The use of acneceuticals is an effective way to improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 5 dermatologists met for a consensus conference in October 2023 to identify a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating acneceuticals with prescription medications and procedures.

Results

The algorithm stratifies the use of acneceuticals first as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or maintenance therapy and then further diverges by skin phenotype (oily or dry/sensitive) and primary lesion morphology (comedonal or inflammatory). Finally, specific acneceuticals are recommended for each phenotypic description.

Conclusion

The algorithm is intended to serve as a guideline for integrating active nonprescription skin care into prescription acne therapy, improving efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, resulting in superior patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(4):376–380. doi:10.36849/JDD.8887.

### Evidence-based review: fixed-combination therapy and topical retinoids in the treatment of acne [^112kVXQf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical fixed-combination products and topical retinoid monotherapy are established first-line treatments for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, yet adequate comparative data are lacking. The following evidence-based review addresses the question: "In patients with mild-to-moderate acne, are topical fixed-combination products or topical retinoids a more efficacious choice in reducing noninflammatory, inflammatory and total lesions after 12 weeks of treatment?" To identify relevant studies, a PubMed search was performed using "acne" and search terms for adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, or erythromycin. Forty-two studies from January 1991 to November 2009 were included. The studies were evaluated using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, and all but seven received the highest level of evidence grade. To evaluate efficacy, a side-by-side comparison was made using reduction in acne lesion counts at week 12 for study groups treated with fixed-combination therapy or retinoid monotherapy. Twenty-nine studies containing relevant efficacy data for fixed-combination therapy and retinoid monotherapy are summarized here. Nine studies compared fixed-combination therapy with retinoid monotherapy; in eight of these studies, fixed-combination therapy was significantly more efficacious in reducing acne lesion counts. This evidence-based review analyzes clinical evidence to date for these therapies to provide guidance in determining appropriate treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate acne.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113KPk7C]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As knowledge of acne pathogenesis expands, novel approaches for targeting inflammation are rapidly emerging in the form of topical, systemic, procedural, and combination therapies. New or modified medications within familiar classes, the repurposing of drugs used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the development of novel treatment modalities may all be efficacious in treating acne. Some of these treatments have the added benefit of decreasing and treating acne sequelae, including atrophic scarring and dyspigmentation. The diverse mechanisms of action include direct bactericidal activity against C. acnes, inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor release, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the immune system, and modulation of the microbiome. With growing concerns over antimicrobial resistance and with certain individuals unable to tolerate well-established therapies, additional treatment options that are safe and effective in all skin types and colors are needed.

The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne published recommendations for the management of acne as a supplement to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2003. The recommendations incorporated evidence-based strategies when possible and the collective clinical experience of the group when evidence was lacking. This update reviews new information about acne pathophysiology and treatment-such as lasers and light therapy-and relevant topics where published data were sparse in 2003 but are now available including combination therapy, revision of acne scarring, and maintenance therapy. The update also includes a new way of looking at acne as a chronic disease, a discussion of the changing role of antibiotics in acne management as a result of concerns about microbial resistance, and factors that affect adherence to acne treatments. Summary statements and recommendations are provided throughout the update along with an indication of the level of evidence that currently supports each finding. As in the original supplement, the authors have based recommendations on published evidence as much as possible.

### Pathogenesis of acne vulgaris: recent advances [^116paZRa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common disorder seen in ambulatory dermatology practice. Acne causes significant morbidity and the direct costs associated with it exceed $2.2 billion per year in the United States (U.S.). The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of acne lesions has improved with time. Follicular hyperkeratinization, sebum production, presence of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), inflammatory mediators, and androgens have been identified as key components of acne pathophysiology. Recent advances have been made in this area with the discovery of P. acnes interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), vaccines targeting P. acnes or its components, antimicrobial peptides and the role of hormones.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^116WCbmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free‐text terms and study‐type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).

Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta‐analysis

A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. Reported severity levels in each study were used for study categorization into mild‐to‐moderate or moderate‐to‐severe acne. Based on the committee's expert advice, if severity was unclear or reported as 'moderate', the study was categorized as mild‐to‐moderate acne if each participant had only noninflammatory lesions, or < 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≤ 30, whereas the study was categorized as moderate‐to‐severe acne if each participant had ≥ 3 nodules (regardless of the number of other inflammatory lesions), or ≥ 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≥ 40. If this information could not be obtained or the mean number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was 31–39, the study was excluded from the review.

### Evolution of acne assessments and impact on acne medications: an evolving, imperfect paradigm [^111qEBbk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Outcomes for success in acne interventional trials include statistically significant differences from baseline between treatment arms in lesion counts (comedonal, inflammatory and/or total) and in thresholds of categorical improvement in investigator global assessments (IGA).

Objectives

We evaluated differences in outcome measures and definition of success in acne trials; and their impact on FDA approval and indications for acne medications.

Methods

Review of acne clinical trial literature, prescribing information and regulatory guidelines for currently approved acne medications in the United States.

Results

Numerous IGA scales exist with variations in specific categorical definitions. There are also differences in definitions of global success. Outcome success may not be accurately translated into corresponding terminology for indications.

Conclusions

Variability in IGA scales and definitions of success confound comparison of trial results for acne treatments. Harmonization and standardization of these factors will facilitate meta-analytics and treatment selection in patient care. Outcome measure success has not consistently been incorporated into acne medication indications.

### Photodynamic therapy for acne vulgaris: a critical review from basics to clinical practice: part I. acne vulgaris: when and why consider photodynamic therapy? [^113uubEX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral medications. However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement.

Learning Objectives

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

### Acne vulgaris: pathogenesis, treatment, and needs assessment [^114YopSY]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition with substantial cutaneous and psychologic disease burden. Studies suggest that the emotional impact of acne is comparable to that experienced by patients with systemic diseases, like diabetes and epilepsy. In conjunction with the considerable personal burden experienced by patients with acne, acne vulgaris also accounts for substantial societal and health care burden. The pathogenesis and existing treatment strategies for acne are complex. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of acne vulgaris.

### Skin microbiota in health and disease: from sequencing to biology [^115j6bjy]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne Vulgaris

Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit, which are sebaceous glands that are connected to hair follicles, and important for the secretion of sebum. Although C. acnes is highly common in healthy adults, its presence and formation of biofilms are associated with acne vulgaris. 64 The anaerobic and lipid‐rich milieu of the sebaceous gland provides the optimal environment for C. acnes to thrive, especially when the follicle shaft is blocked. Recent metagenomic studies on several C. acnes strains have shown that genetic differences can possibly explain why some C. acnes strains act as commensals and other strains act as pathogens. 65 Furthermore, it was shown that skin microbiome differences relate to the grade of acne vulgaris. 66 These studies underline the importance and added value of performing metagenomic studies to go up to strain‐level depth.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Acne vulgaris is one of the most encountered dermatologic conditions by dermatologists worldwide. Although the true prevalence is difficult to approximate, it is estimated to affect about 9% of the population. In the US alone, 5 million physician visits are attributed to acne annually, costing > 2 billion dollars. Cumulative prevalence approaches 100% in adolescence and decreases with age, affecting up to 64% of individuals aged 20–29 years and 43% of individuals aged 30–39 years, respectively. Age, oily skin, family history, and obesity are all risk factors for developing acne. While well-powered studies comparing acne in various racial and ethnic groups are lacking, acne is regarded as very common across global populations.

Clinical Presentation

Acne is classified morphologically, including comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic, and mixed phenotypes with varying severity. Acne can affect the face, chest, and back, or a combination of these areas. Scarring and pigmentary changes are frequent, with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring being more common in skin of color.

Quality of Life

Acne may profoundly impair quality of life by limiting self-esteem and self-confidence, placing individuals at a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. Acne is associated with increased risk of self-injury and suicide attempts, highlighting the concerning and significant connection between acne and mental health. The widespread presence of acne along with its effects on quality of life underscore the importance of having a broad spectrum of treatment options targeting its various pathogenetic factors.

### Optimizing isotretinoin treatment of acne: update on current recommendations for monitoring, dosing, safety, adverse effects, compliance, and outcomes [^115UTVrt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by dermatologists. It can be severe and result in permanent scars. Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne and has the potential for long-term clearance. Prescribing and monitoring protocols can vary widely among prescribers. Recent studies, reports, and consensus statements help shed light on optimizing the use of isotretinoin for acne. A recent literature review is summarized in this article to help the practitioner optimize isotretinoin use for acne. The article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of standard, high-dose, and low-dose isotretinoin regimens; discusses the current status of controversies surrounding isotretinoin (including depression/suicide, pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease); reviews monitoring recommendations and treatment for hypertriglyceridemia and elevated transaminase levels; and discusses common adverse effects seen with isotretinoin, along with their treatment and prevention.

### Practical considerations in acne treatment and the clinical impact of topical combination therapy [^113jUK2G]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent, multifactorial disease process affecting the pilosebaceous units of the dermis. The effects of acne are profound both physically and psychosocially across all age groups and ethnicities; therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches range from simple monotherapy to multimodal treatments with a variety of topical and systemic agents. Optimal patient outcomes in acne management, however, are based both on treatment efficacy as well as overall patient satisfaction. In an effort to comprehensively address these key clinical considerations in acne management, we examine the diverse nature of acne patients, the factors in optimizing treatment outcomes, and the clinical impact of current medications, particularly topical combination therapy.

### Light therapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^115iQHGi]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, lasers and light-based systems have become a common modality to treat a wide variety of skin-related conditions, including acne vulgaris. In spite of the various oral and topical treatments available for the treatment of acne, many patients fail to respond adequately or may develop side effects. Therefore, there is a growing demand by patients for a fast, safe, and side-effect-free novel therapy.

Objectives

To address the role of light therapy in the armamentarium of treatments for acne vulgaris, to discuss photobiology aspects and biomedical optics, to review current technologies of laser/light-based devices, to review the clinical experience and results, and to outline clinical guidelines and treatment considerations.

Results

Clinical trials show that 85% of the patients demonstrate a significant quantitative reduction in at least 50% of the lesions after four biweekly treatments. In approximately 20% of the cases, acne eradication may reach 90%. At 3 months after the last treatment, clearance is approximately 70% to 80%. The nonrespondent rate is 15% to 20%.

Conclusions

Laser and light-based therapy is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. Amelioration of acne by light therapy, although comparable to the effects of oral antibiotics, offers faster resolution and fewer side effects and leads to patient satisfaction.

### Acne vaccines: therapeutic option for the treatment of acne vulgaris? [^112CzuKP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne, one of the most common skin diseases, is caused by multiple factors, including Propionibacterium acnes. Studies suggest that responses to P. acnes by host immunity play important roles in its pathogenesis. Identifying immune modulators that attenuate inflammatory responses against P. acnes and the inhibition of bacterial growth may lead to novel avenues of immunologic intervention.

### Topical, light-based, and complementary interventions for acne: an overview of systematic reviews [^115cAkoT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease of the pilosebaceous unit (the skin structure consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland). It is characterised by non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). Lesions may be present on the face, thorax, and back, with variable severity. Acne exhibits a global distribution and has a growing prevalence. Acne vulgaris is the most common form. Acne gives rise to complications such as scars and can seriously affect people's mental health, especially those with severe acne. Acne has a huge impact on the quality of life and self-esteem of those affected.

Objectives

To synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-systemic pharmacological interventions and non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy and complementary therapies) in the treatment of acne vulgaris and related skin complications.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, and Embase to 2 December 2021, and checked the reference lists of included reviews. At least two authors were responsible for screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. We excluded reviews with high risk of bias as assessed with the ROBIS tool. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence according to GRADE (as carried out by the authors of the included reviews or ourselves). We provide comprehensive evidence from the review data, including summary of findings tables, summary of results tables, and evidence maps.

Main Results

We retrieved and assessed a total of 733 records; however, only six reviews (five Cochrane reviews and one non-Cochrane review) with low risk of bias met the overview inclusion criteria. The six reviews involved 40,910 people with acne from 275 trials and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 trials. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with an average age range from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. Main results for clinically important comparisons: Benzoyl peroxide versus placebo or no treatment: In two trials involving 1012 participants over 12 weeks, benzoyl peroxide may reduce the total (mean difference (MD) -16.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.51 to -5.78), inflammatory (MD -6.12, 95% CI -11.02 to -1.22), and non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -9.69, 95% CI -15.08 to -4.29) when compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials including 1073 participants (time point: 10 and 12 weeks) suggested benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect in improving participants' global self-assessment compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.22; very low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggested that benzoyl peroxide may improve investigators' global assessment (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28; 6 trials, 4110 participants, long-term treatment (12 weeks)) compared to placebo. Thirteen trials including 4287 participants over 10 to 12 weeks suggested benzoyl peroxide may increase the risk of a less serious adverse event compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical retinoids: Benzoyl peroxide may increase the percentage change in total lesion count compared to adapalene (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 10.8, 95% CI 3.38 to 18.22; 1 trial, 205 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). When compared to adapalene, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts (MD -7.7, 95% CI -16.46 to 1.06; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), percentage change in non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -3.9, 95% CI -13.31 to 5.51; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 4 trials, 1123 participants, 11 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigators' global assessment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37; 3 trials, 1965 participants, 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, 1573 participants, 5 trials, 11 to 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical antibiotics: When compared to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): total lesion counts (MD -3.50, 95% CI -7.54 to 0.54; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), inflammatory lesion counts (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.99 to 0.59; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -2.4, 95% CI -5.3 to 0.5; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 trial, 240 participants, 10 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigator's global assessment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45; 2 trials, 2277 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.64; 5 trials, 2842 participants, 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). For these clinically important comparisons, no review collected data for the following outcomes: frequency of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event or quality of life. No review collected data for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids versus placebo or no treatment, or topical retinoids versus topical antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarises the evidence for topical therapy, phototherapy, and complementary therapy for acne and acne scars. We found no high-certainty evidence for the effects of any therapy included. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews related to acne and acne scars had limitations (low methodological quality). We could not summarise the evidence for topical retinoids and topical antibiotics due to insufficient high-quality systematic reviews. Future research should consider pooled analysis of data on new emerging drugs for acne treatment (e.g. clascoterone) and focus more on acne complications.

### Adolescent acne vulgaris: current and emerging treatments [^1132g3WX]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the commonest inflammatory skin diseases seen worldwide, affecting all ethnicities and races, with a peak prevalence between age 15 years and 20 years. The burden of this condition, and the resulting clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently results in psychological and social morbidity because of concerns about appearance. As understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving the optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge. In the past few years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid receptors and androgen receptors. This Review considers the management approaches of an adolescent with acne vulgaris and reviews treatment options from the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting current treatments and novel and emerging treatment regimens are discussed.

### Toward evidence-based practice in acne: consensus of an Asian working group [^114Bi71V]. The Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is common throughout the world and often perceived by both patients and clinicians as an inconsequential disease of adolescence. In reality, however, acne is a chronic medical disease that lasts for years and causes a considerable impact on quality of life. Many patients with acne experience emotional problems due to their disease, which can lead to reduced social interactions and even a lower likelihood of employment. Little has been written specifically about acne in Asian patients in the English-language medical published work, perhaps due to an assumption that the management of acne is the same in all populations. A group of acne experts from nine Asian countries and the USA met to review and discuss acne care within the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on evidence-based medicine. This group developed a care algorithm using results of clinical trials as well as knowledge of practice patterns.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111pW6v7]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This economic analysis allowed estimation of the relative cost‐effectiveness of a range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. The results informed the NICE national guidance on the management of acne vulgaris. There remains a need for well‐conducted studies that examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Phototherapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris: what is its role? [^112bDhK3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date, different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the current management of acne vulgaris.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^115LPGJW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with significant negative impact on quality of life and mental health. Acne is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, with long-lasting sequelae including scarring and dyspigmentation, the latter of which is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alteration of sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Newer research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiologic categories. This greater understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These modalities include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article will provide an overview of emerging treatments of acne and their link to our current and improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.

### Japanese Dermatological Association guidelines: guidelines for the treatment of acne vulgaris 2017 [^1153Zszz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The Guidelines for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris of the Japanese Dermatological Association was first published in Japanese in 2008 and revised in 2016 and 2017. These guidelines (GL) indicate the standard acne treatments in Japan and address pharmaceutical drugs and treatments applicable or in use in Japan. In these GL, the strength of the recommendation is based on clinical evidences as well as availability in Japanese medical institutions. In the 2016 and 2017 GL, some of the clinical questions were revised, and other questions were added in accordance with approval of topical medicines containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Rather than monotherapies of antibiotics, the 2017 GL more strongly recommend combination therapies, especially fixed-dose combination gels including BPO in the aspects of pharmacological actions and compliance in the acute inflammatory phase to achieve earlier and better improvements. The 2017 GL also indicate to limit the antimicrobial treatments for the acute inflammatory phase up to approximately 3 months and recommend BPO, adapalene, and a fixed-dose combination gel of 0.1% adapalene and 2.5% BPO for the maintenance phase to avoid the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. The 2017 GL also discuss rosacea, which requires discrimination from acne and a different treatment plan.

### Acne vulgaris [^114htwt7]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinisation, inflammation, and bacterial colonisation of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes. Although early colonisation with P acnes and family history might have important roles in the disease, exactly what triggers acne and how treatment affects the course of the disease remain unclear. Other factors such as diet have been implicated, but not proven. Facial scarring due to acne affects up to 20% of teenagers. Acne can persist into adulthood, with detrimental effects on self-esteem. There is no ideal treatment for acne, although a suitable regimen for reducing lesions can be found for most patients. Good quality evidence on comparative effectiveness of common topical and systemic acne therapies is scarce. Topical therapies including benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antibiotics when used in combination usually improve control of mild to moderate acne. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives can help women with acne. Patients with more severe inflammatory acne usually need oral antibiotics combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease antibiotic-resistant organisms. Oral isotretinoin is the most effective therapy and is used early in severe disease, although its use is limited by teratogenicity and other side-effects. Availability, adverse effects, and cost, limit the use of photodynamic therapy. New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.

### Management of acne vulgaris… [^115n7XHz]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide. Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Observations Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology, distribution, and severity. Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted.

Topical therapies such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0. 025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years.

First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.

### Adolescent female acne: etiology and management [^112xsB7s]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a multifactorial condition often conferring significant psychosocial morbidity, affects an estimated 40 million people in the United States. The majority of these individuals are adolescents and young adults. The pathophysiology of the condition is still not fully known, but it is believed to be related in part to excess sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization by P acnes, and inflammation. Prior to initiating treatment in a female patient, a hyperandrogenic state must be considered and ruled out through history, physical exam, and laboratory evaluation if necessary. Treatment options are vast and include hormonal therapy among others. Hormonal therapies have long been noted to reduce acne lesions and offer a valuable adjuvant to standard therapy. Hormonal agents are thought to improve acne by blocking the androgen receptor and/or decreasing circulating androgens which leads to decreased sebum production. Hormonal treatment options include spironolactone, other antiandrogens, and oral contraceptives. The use of these agents to effectively treat acne has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Optimal results are often achieved with combination therapy with the goal of targeting multiple pathogenic pathways in acne development.

### Light therapies for acne [^1153NjFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for light therapies.

Objectives

To explore the effects of light treatment of different wavelengths for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 71 studies, randomising a total of 4211 participants. Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly. Selection and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear. Comparisons of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies, including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light) concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of 20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively. For our second primary outcome 'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360 participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51 to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical difference between these two interventions for lesion counts. Studies comparing the effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects. Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light therapies. Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking. There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne. Carefully planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26·16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16·75–35·36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39·70%, 95% CrI 12·54–66·78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35·36%, 95% CrI 17·75–53·08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44·43%, 95% CrI 29·20–60·02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg −1 per single course (58·09%, 95% CrI 36·99–79·29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40·45%, 95% CrI 26·17–54·11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43·53%, 95% CrI 29·49–57·70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Antibiotic resistance in acne treatment [^116uBu43]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the evidence for antibiotic resistance in acne, and how does resistance affect treatment?

Bottom Line

Use of topical and systemic antibiotics for acne is associated with formation of resistance in Propionibacterium acnes and other bacteria, with clinical consequences. Guidelines recommend resistance reduction strategies including avoidance of antibiotic monotherapy, combination treatment with topical modalities, and limiting the duration of oral antibiotic use.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

Acne vulgaris, a disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, is one of the most commonly encountered conditions in dermatology practice. Effective treatment of acne vulgaris is important in that it can prevent psychosocial distress and physical scarring. Systemic therapeutic options are available for moderate to severe acne. It is imperative that the safe and effective treatment revolves around the health care provider's familiarity of side effects of various treatments. In this article, the side effects and monitoring guide for the most commonly prescribed systemic agents for acne vulgaris are reviewed.

### Management of acne vulgaris: a review [^112DMEmP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acne vulgaris:

- Definition: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects late adolescents and young adults.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of acne vulgaris is multifaceted, which includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity leading to hyperseborrhea or increased sebum production, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation, and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity.
- Epidemiology: The worldwide prevalence of acne vulgaris is estimated at 1,585 per 100,000 population.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for acne vulgaris include hormonal influences, particularly androgens that enhance sebum production, most notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome, genetic predisposition with identified susceptibility loci, the use of specific medications, obesity, family history, and environmental factors. The precise etiological triggers of acne, however, remain unclear.
- Disease course: Clinically, acne vulgaris presents with a variety of lesions, including open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules and cysts in severe cases. It typically resolves in the late teens or early adulthood, but for some patients, it can persist into later life. Scarring, a potential consequence, can reduce the QoL of patients.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Acne vulgaris is not a life-threatening condition. However, it can have significant physical and psychological effects.

### The development of antimicrobial resistance due to the antibiotic treatment of acne vulgaris: a review [^112WgxKL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Data Sources

Sources for this article were identified by searching the English literature by Medline for the period 1960 to March 2009.

Study Selection

The following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection.

Data Synthesis

Both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. The development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids.

Conclusion

Long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. These findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.
