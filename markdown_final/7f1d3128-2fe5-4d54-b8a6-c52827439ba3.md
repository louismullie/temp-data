## Question

Smoking in Crohns

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how smoking affects Crohn's disease, including its impact on risk, disease phenotype, treatment response, and outcomes, as well as practical counseling and management recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and direction of epidemiologic associations between smoking and Crohn's disease. Then, I should verify how smoking modifies disease phenotype and natural history. Next, I will examine treatment response and postoperative recurrence, including dose-response and passive smoking effects. After that, I need to review mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based counseling and cessation strategies, and close with a concise clinical takeaway that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the core epidemiology before drawing conclusions. Multiple high-quality cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show that current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease by roughly 1.5–2-fold, with a dose–response by pack-years, and twin and population-based datasets reinforce a causal interpretation despite observational designs, whereas smoking does not increase ulcerative colitis incidence and may even be protective in some contexts, underscoring a disease-specific effect in Crohn's disease [^111Mr4yu] [^113Kw24g] [^1159YBhZ].

> Wait, let me verify how smoking shapes phenotype and complications, because this drives prognosis. Smokers with Crohn's disease are more likely to have ileal or ileocolonic disease, stricturing or penetrating behavior, perianal complications, and earlier progression to complicated disease, and smoking is associated with higher risks of corticosteroid use, steroid dependency, and intestinal surgery, with meta-analytic data showing a 27% higher hazard of first intestinal resection in current smokers compared with never smokers, while former smokers approximate never smokers in surgical risk, suggesting reversibility after cessation [^113n6kFo] [^112zShzy] [^114qvkUv] [^116avSw9].

> Hold on, I should double-check treatment response, since modern therapy could theoretically blunt smoking's impact. Observational and pooled analyses suggest current smokers have lower odds of clinical response and remission with anti-TNF therapy, particularly when smoking exposure is clearly defined, and smokers demonstrate attenuated response to episodic infliximab and higher re-intervention needs after endoscopic balloon dilation, whereas randomized data are less consistent, likely reflecting selection and confounding; intriguingly, thiopurines may mitigate postoperative recurrence more in smokers, highlighting a potential pharmacologic countermeasure while cessation remains foundational [^113JGJxE] [^115tmHYC] [^113YVFgQ].

> I need to ensure I capture postoperative outcomes accurately, because this is where smoking exerts a pronounced effect. Active smoking is among the strongest modifiable predictors of postoperative recurrence after ileocolic resection, with smokers experiencing earlier and more frequent clinical and surgical recurrence, and smoking cessation after surgery substantially reduces long-term surgical recurrence and the need for maintenance immunomodulation, reinforcing cessation as a core postoperative intervention alongside early endoscopic surveillance and risk-stratified prophylaxis [^116Ate5z] [^115xHHZ2] [^116avSw9].

> But wait, what about dose and passive exposure; do low-intensity smokers escape harm. Light smoking still worsens disease activity and increases hospitalizations compared with nonsmokers, indicating no safe threshold, and passive smoke exposure independently increases the risk of intestinal surgery in never-active smokers, with childhood passive exposure also predicting later active smoking, so counseling must extend beyond active smokers to household smoke exposure [^113VxZQj] [^111pqY1F].

> Let me consider mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility. Smoking impairs mucosal barrier function, alters gut microbiota with reduced diversity and shifts in Bacteroides–Prevotella, and exerts oxidative stress with dysregulated cytokine signaling in Crohn's disease, while gene–environment interactions, including NOD2 and HLA-region variants, modify smoking-related risk, and functional studies show mononuclear cell dysfunction in smokers with Crohn's disease, supporting a direct pathogenic role rather than mere confounding [^114gdkjY] [^116ExJpf] [^11618hxd] [^111TGXRR].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to anchor practice. Contemporary ACG guidelines issue a strong recommendation to counsel all patients with Crohn's disease who smoke to quit, citing exacerbation of disease activity, acceleration of recurrence, and worse medical and surgical outcomes, and preventive care updates reiterate that smoking cessation is among the most effective disease-modifying strategies in Crohn's disease, with supportive data on reduced flares and steroid needs after quitting [^114iM1uR] [^1178wa7V] [^115pAcgp].

> I will now examine practical cessation counseling, because implementation matters. Despite high awareness among gastroenterologists, counseling rates and comfort with prescribing cessation therapy remain suboptimal, yet patients with Crohn's disease are not inherently refractory to quitting and often have moderate nicotine dependence, so structured cessation support, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up should be embedded in routine IBD care, ideally using a team-based approach and addressing psychosocial stressors that impede quit success [^112FKyXx] [^112UPwGP] [^115pAcgp].

> Hold on, I should verify whether personalized risk communication helps. A randomized trial in high-risk relatives found that adding DNA-based risk information to standard counseling did not improve quit rates compared with standard risk communication, so clinicians should prioritize clear, behaviorally actionable counseling about disease-specific harms and benefits of quitting rather than genetic testing to motivate cessation [^116Tbrza] [^115Jroyy].

> Let me synthesize a clinical takeaway and ensure it aligns with the evidence. Smoking is a major, modifiable driver of worse outcomes in Crohn's disease, increasing susceptibility, accelerating complicated phenotypes, impairing response to biologics, and doubling postoperative recurrence risk, with benefits of cessation evident across relapse, steroid exposure, and surgical recurrence; therefore, every patient with Crohn's disease who smokes should receive repeated, structured cessation counseling as a core disease-modifying therapy integrated with medical and surgical management plans [^114iM1uR] [^116avSw9] [^116Ate5z].

Smoking is a major modifiable risk factor in Crohn's disease, with **current smokers having higher risks** of developing CD, experiencing more severe disease, and requiring more steroids, immunomodulators, biologics, and surgery [^114iM1uR] [^113LXbvM]. Smoking increases relapse and postoperative recurrence, and is linked to stricturing and penetrating complications [^116Ate5z] [^116avSw9]. Smoking cessation **improves disease course**, reducing flares, steroid use, and surgery; even light smoking is harmful, and passive smoking also worsens outcomes [^115pAcgp] [^111pqY1F]. Clinicians should **routinely counsel cessation**, provide support, and monitor adherence, as quitting is one of the most effective interventions in CD [^1178wa7V] [^11312ckz].

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking smoking and Crohn's disease

- **Increased risk of developing CD**: Current smokers have a 1.76-fold higher risk of developing CD than never smokers (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.40–2.22) [^113LXbvM] [^111Mr4yu].

- **Dose-response relationship**: Higher pack-years correlate with greater CD risk (Ptrend < 0.0001) [^113Kw24g].

- **Familial aggregation**: In twin/sibling studies, smoking is strongly associated with CD (OR 10.5, 95% CI 2.6–92) [^113LXbvM] [^114HFQPC].

---

## Clinical course and severity of Crohn's disease in smokers

- **Increased disease activity**: Smokers have more frequent and severe flares than nonsmokers [^114iM1uR] [^114yrBx7].

- **Higher relapse rates**: Continuing smokers relapse more often (IRR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10–2.17) [^114yrBx7].

- **Greater need for corticosteroids**: Smokers require more steroids and have higher steroid dependency [^112zShzy].

- **Increased immunomodulator and biologic use**: Smokers need more thiopurines and biologics, reflecting more aggressive disease [^116BQx5P] [^115tmHYC].

- **Higher surgery risk**: Current smokers have more intestinal resections (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.49) [^114qvkUv] [^117AkwPE].

- **Postoperative recurrence**: Smoking increases clinical and surgical recurrence after resection [^114vuuE7] [^116dfW4F].

---

## Smoking and Crohn's disease phenotype

Smoking is associated with **stricturing and penetrating disease**, with higher risks of strictures, fistulas, and abscesses [^1152TB1D] [^114HZuXx]. It is also linked to **perianal complications**, including increased rates of perianal fistulas and abscesses [^116avSw9] [^115tmHYC].

---

## Mechanisms underlying smoking's impact on Crohn's disease

Several plausible mechanisms underlie smoking's harm in CD:

- **Immune modulation**: Smoking alters cytokines and immune responses, promoting inflammation [^116i55wd] [^11618hxd].

- **Microbiome alterations**: Smoking reduces gut microbial diversity, worsening dysbiosis [^114gdkjY].

- **Oxidative stress**: Cigarette smoke increases oxidative stress, damaging the mucosa [^116i55wd].

- **Nicotine effects**: Nicotine may impair mucosal healing and increase permeability [^116i55wd].

---

## Benefits of smoking cessation in Crohn's disease

Smoking cessation **improves disease outcomes**:

- **Reduced relapse**: Quitters have fewer flares than continuing smokers [^114yrBx7] [^1143VCdq].

- **Lower steroid use**: Quitters need fewer steroids and have less steroid dependency [^112zShzy].

- **Reduced surgery risk**: Quitting lowers the need for intestinal resection [^notfound].

- **Improved postoperative outcomes**: Cessation reduces postoperative recurrence and reoperation [^115xHHZ2] [^115pAcgp].

---

## Passive smoking and Crohn's disease

Passive smoking also **harms patients with CD**, increasing the risk of intestinal surgery (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.04–2.9) [^111pqY1F].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines **strongly recommend cessation**:

- **Routine counseling**: Clinicians should counsel all smokers with CD to quit [^114iM1uR] [^1178wa7V].

- **Structured cessation programs**: Use behavioral support and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement, bupropion, varenicline) [^113SpnGc].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Track cessation and relapse at each visit [^notfound].

---

## Patient awareness and adherence

Awareness of smoking's harms is **often limited**, with only about half of patients fully informed; informed patients are more likely to intend to quit [^111CSBkb]. Adherence to cessation is challenging, with **relapse common**; ongoing support improves success [^11312ckz].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Current smokers** | **Former smokers** | **Never smokers** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Risk of developing CD | Increased | Slightly increased | Baseline |
| Disease activity | Higher | Lower | Baseline |
| Relapse rates | Higher | Lower | Baseline |
| Steroid use | Higher | Lower | Baseline |
| Immunomodulator/biologic use | Higher | Lower | Baseline |
| Surgery risk | Higher | Similar to never | Baseline |
| Postoperative recurrence | Higher | Lower | Baseline |

---

Smoking **worsens CD across the disease course**, increasing risk, severity, relapse, and surgery, while cessation improves outcomes. Clinicians should prioritize cessation counseling and support as a core disease-modifying strategy.

### Smoking cessation and the course of Crohn's disease: an intervention study [^1143VCdq]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

To evaluate the benefit of smoking cessation in individuals with Crohn's disease, we performed an intervention study in a large cohort of smokers with the disease.

Methods

Repeated counseling to stop smoking, with easy access to a smoking cessation program, was given to 474 consecutive smokers with Crohn's disease. Patients who stopped smoking for more than 1 year (quitters) were included in a prospective follow-up study, which compared disease course and therapeutic needs with 2 control groups, continuing smokers and nonsmokers, paired for age, gender, disease location, and activity.

Results

There were 59 quitters (12%). Predictors of quitting were the physician, previous intestinal surgery, high socioeconomic status, and in women, oral contraceptive use. During a median follow-up of 29 months (1–54 months), the risk of flare-up in quitters did not differ from that in nonsmokers and was less than in continuing smokers (P < 0.001). Need for steroids and for introduction or reinforcement of immunosuppressive therapy, respectively, were similar in quitters and nonsmokers and increased in continuing smokers. The risk of surgery was not significantly different in the 3 groups.

Conclusions

Patients with Crohn's disease who stop smoking for more than 1 year have a more benign disease course than if they had never smoked.

### Impact of smoking cessation on the clinical course of Crohn's disease under current therapeutic algorithms: a multicenter prospective study [^114yrBx7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Given the importance of tobacco smoking (TS) as the only environmental factor repeatedly linked to the development of the Crohn's disease (CD), it is surprising that very few prospective studies have assessed whether TS is associated with an increased frequency of clinical relapse. Our aim was to evaluate the current impact of TS on disease relapse and the clinical benefit of quitting smoking in the present era of widespread use of anti-TNF drugs and immunosuppressants.

Methods

This was a multicenter prospective cohort study, which included 573 CD patients in clinical remission with various smoking habits. All smokers were advised to quit. Patients not exposed to tobacco before inclusion (non- and former smokers), continuing smokers, and quitters were compared regarding differences in disease outcomes during a follow-up of 4 years.

Results

A total of 148 continuing smokers, 190 nonsmokers, 160 former smokers, and 75 quitters were included. In comparison with nonsmokers, continuing smokers relapsed more frequently with an incidence rate ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–2.17). Former smokers and quitters had similar relapse incidences compared with nonsmokers. Smoking was an independent predictor for disease relapse in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.20–2.09). In the time-dependent analysis, continuing smokers had earlier relapse, regardless of anti-TNF or immunosuppressant use.

Conclusions

Continuing smokers have more disease relapses, and patients who quit smoking have a similar relapse incidence compared with nonsmokers.

### Association of intestinal granulomas with smoking, phenotype, and serology in Chinese patients with Crohn's disease [^115cEifF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a heterogenous disease characterized by variable manifestations and outcomes, and increasing in incidence in China. Phenotypic classification has been proposed to assist in subtyping of disease. Non-caseating intestinal granulomas are a hallmark of CD, but whether intestinal granulomas help predict Chinese CD phenotypes or determine severity, is not known.

Aims

To determine the association between intestinal granulomas with CD phenotype, severity, risk factors, and serological markers.

Methods

This was a single-centre study of consecutive definite Chinese CD cases. Granulomas were diagnosed by an experienced GI pathologist. Correlation with the Vienna Classification and other parameters was performed.

Results

Eighty Chinese CD patients were recruited, 40 (50%) of whom had intestinal granulomas. Intestinal granulomas were independently associated with the stricturing behavior (OR: 4.71; 95% CI: 1.41–15.72), colonic location of disease (OR: 26.96; 95% CI: 2.68–271.14), but not with age of CD diagnosis. Current or previous smoking protected against the development of granulomas (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04–0.59). Granulomas were not associated with peri-anal involvement, extra-intestinal manifestations, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody or anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody serology, or severity of CD gauged by the requirement of major intestinal surgery or immunomodulating therapy.

Conclusions

Intestinal granulomas in the setting of CD may be helpful in determining phenotypic subtypes of CD, but is unhelpful in predicting disease severity. Smoking impairs the formation of granulomas in CD.

Smoking cessation — may reduce postoperative morbidity in patients with Crohn's disease (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). In a retrospective National Surgical Quality Improvement Program study of patients with Crohn's disease who underwent resection, active smokers (n = 2047) had increased postoperative infectious complications (OR, 1.30; p < 0.001), pulmonary complications (OR, 1.87; p < 0.001), and readmissions (OR, 1.58; p = 0.004) compared with nonsmokers (n = 5584), whereas a single-institution retrospective review of 691 patients found smoking was not significantly associated with postoperative complications.

### Lifestyle, behaviour, and environmental modification for the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases: an international organization for study of inflammatory bowel diseases consensus [^113rZj2R]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

### Influence of Crohn's disease risk alleles and smoking on disease location [^113n6kFo]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective is to assess the effect of genetic and environmental factors on Crohn's disease location.

Design

We identified 628 patients with Crohn's disease within the Washington University database (April 2005 through February 2010) that had complete information on 31 Crohn's disease-associated genotypes and clinical information on disease location (L1 to L4), smoking, sex, race, and age at diagnosis. For statistical reasons, the 3 major NOD2 alleles (rs2066844, rs2066845, and rs2066847) were grouped together. Logistic regression incorporating all of the genotypes and clinical covariates, including smoking, was performed with stepwise variable selection and by best subset selection.

Results

Stepwise variable selection selected 3 major covariates, composite NOD2 genotype, smoking, and TNFSF15 genotype, which are also the 3 covariates selected by the best subset method. Whereas the NOD2 genotype and smoking are positively associated with ileal (L1 + L3) disease, the TNFSF15 genotype is positively associated with isolated colonic (L2) disease.

Limitations

The ability to detect disease site associations in this single-center study may be limited by the population size, low allelic frequency, and/or low odds ratio of certain Crohn's disease risk alleles.

Conclusion

These results indicate that NOD2 genotype, smoking status, and TNFSF15 genotype should be included as covariates in assessing the effect of genetic and environmental factors on Crohn's disease site location.

### Preventive therapy in postoperative Crohn's disease [^116Va5zr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrence of Crohn's disease following surgical resection is common, but the optimal strategy to assess, prevent, and treat postoperative recurrence remains unclear. Recent developments in the prevention and management of postoperative recurrence have provided additional information.

Recent Findings

Predictors of Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery include cigarette smoking, disease behavior, number of prior resections, family history, anastomotic type, and time to first surgery. Only penetrating disease behavior and continued cigarette smoking after surgery remain clear predictors of postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. Ileocolonoscopy is the only modality to detect mucosal recurrence after surgery; however, surrogate markers of inflammation, specifically stool lactoferrin and calprotectin as well as small intestine contrast ultrasound, are promising. Due to the high rate of surgery for the treatment of complications of Crohn's disease, prevention of postoperative disease has received considerable attention. Recent studies of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, nitroimidazole antibiotics, and infliximab have broadened the spectrum of medication options postoperatively.

Summary

Smoking cessation and ileocolonoscopy for early detection of Crohn's disease recurrence should be part of any postoperative management strategy. The selection of medication and optimal time to initiate treatment after surgery is less certain. Postoperative immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis factor agents may prevent Crohn's disease in those at high risk for recurrence. Treatment of patients by predictors of recurrence and personalization of management based on genotypes/phenotypes will be the focus of future study.

### Estimating causal effects on a disease progression trait using bivariate mendelian randomisation [^116pPe98]. Genetic Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Estimates of the causal effect of smoking initiation on Crohn's disease prognosis (binary phenotype, good/poor). Standard errors are shown in parentheses.

We then estimated the causal association between smoking cessation and Crohn's disease prognosis. Firstly, we needed to correct for collider bias in the smoking cessation effects, as the cessation phenotype is only defined on ever smokers (Liu et al.). As previously discussed (Cai et al.), we adjusted smoking cessation using smoking initiation in instrument effect regression to correct for collider bias and apply CWLS/MR‐RAPS to remove weak instrument bias, based on the same pruned set of SNPs as above. The adjusted summary statistics for smoking cessation were then used to estimate the causal association with Crohn's disease prognosis. Estimates of causal effects are given in Table 6. It is clear that there is little difference whether collider bias adjustment for smoking cessation is performed by CWLS or MR‐RAPS. All estimates from bias‐adjusted methods are positive, suggesting that given Crohn's disease incidence, the log odds of good prognosis increases by approximately 0.9, when the log odds of quitting smoking increases by 1. This suggests that quitters are more likely to achieve good prognosis. However, the standard errors are relatively large and indicate no robust evidence for a causal effect of smoking cessation. Again, the standard error from MV‐LIML appears to be under‐estimated.

### Effect of communicating DNA based risk assessments for Crohn's disease on smoking cessation: randomised controlled trial [^115Jroyy]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that communicating risk of developing Crohn's disease based on genotype and that stopping smoking can reduce this risk, motivates behaviour change among smokers at familial risk.

Design

Parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Families with Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom.

Participants

497 smokers (mean age 42.6 (SD 14.4) years) who were first degree relatives of probands with Crohn's disease, with outcomes assessed on 209/251 (based on DNA analysis) and 217/246 (standard risk assessment).

Intervention

Communication of risk assessment for Crohn's disease by postal booklet based on family history of the disease and smoking status alone, or with additional DNA analysis for the NOD2 genotype. Participants were then telephoned by a National Health Service Stop Smoking counsellor to review the booklet and deliver brief standard smoking cessation intervention. Calls were tape recorded and a random subsample selected to assess fidelity to the clinical protocol.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was smoking cessation for 24 hours or longer, assessed at six months.

Results

The proportion of participants stopping smoking for 24 hours or longer did not differ between arms: 35% (73/209) in the DNA arm versus 36% (78/217) in the non-DNA arm (difference -1%, 95% confidence interval -10% to 8%, P = 0.83). The proportion making a quit attempt within the DNA arm did not differ between those who were told they had mutations putting them at increased risk (36%), those told they had none (35%), and those in the non-DNA arm (36%).

Conclusion

Among relatives of patients with Crohn's disease, feedback of DNA based risk assessments does not motivate behaviour change to reduce risk any more or less than standard risk assessment. These findings accord with those across a range of populations and behaviours. They do not support the promulgation of commercial DNA based tests nor the search for gene variants that confer increased risk of common complex diseases on the basis that they effectively motivate health related behaviour change.

### Crohn's disease [^112G6Vvm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 60 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^115NUai4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Smoking and first surgical resection in Crohn's disease

The risk of first surgery was significantly increased in current smokers as compared to never smokers (pooled HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.49, 9 studies; heterogeneity: I² = 24%, p = 0.23) (Fig. 1). However, former smokers were not at an increased risk of surgery relative to never smokers (pooled HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30, 9 studies; heterogeneity: I² = 0%, p = 0.60) (Fig. 1). Findings remained consistent when substituting the HR for patients diagnosed between the ages of 17 and 40 and the HR for patients diagnosed after age 40 in the pooled analysis (Additional file 6: Table S5).

Fig. 1
Forest plot depicting the association between smoking and the need for first surgery in patients with Crohn's disease comparing current to never smokers and former to never smokers

One study differentiated between light and heavy current smokers. When the HR comparing light smokers to never smokers was substituted into the meta-analysis, current smoking remained significantly associated with an increased risk of surgery (pooled HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.40, 9 studies; heterogeneity: I² = 18%, p = 0.28) (Additional file 7: Figure S2).

Subgroup analysis based on patient recruitment indicated that current smoking increased the risk of surgery in population-based studies (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.90, 4 studies), but not in patients recruited from tertiary-care centres (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.46, 4 studies) (Additional file 8: Table S6). Former smokers were not at increased risk of surgery relative to never smokers regardless of the method of patient recruitment.

### Is the personality characteristic "impulsive sensation seeking" correlated to differences in current smoking between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients? [^117ATsCq]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with smoking, while ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely a disease of nonsmokers. We aimed to test whether the smoking-linked personality characteristic "impulsive sensation seeking" (ImpSS) is correlated to the differences in smoking in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

In 185 IBD patients, the General Health Questionnaire and the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) were administered. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence was used to assess smokers' nicotine dependence.

Results

CD patients were twice as likely to be active smokers than UC patients. CD patients presented higher ImpSS scores than UC patients, but the differences became nonsignificant after adjustment for age, gender, education and psychological distress. Multivariate analyses, however, showed that the relationship of ImpSS with current smoking was stronger in CD patients. Moderator analysis showed that the relationship of ImpSS with nicotine dependence was also greater in smokers with CD than in those with UC. No other ZKPQ subscale was correlated to disease type, current smoking or nicotine dependence.

Conclusion

ImpSS is associated with current smoking and nicotine dependence in IBD, and these associations are stronger in CD. These findings might be relevant to more effective interventions aiming at smoking cessation in CD patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^116mSxqj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) — disease modifiers emphasize that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may exacerbate disease activity and routine use should be viewed with caution among patients with CD. Cigarette smoking exacerbates disease activity and accelerates disease recurrence, and active smokers should be counseled regarding smoking cessation. Assessment and management of stress, depression, and anxiety is recommended as part of the comprehensive care of the CD patient due to increased risks of disease activity and health care utilization among patients with these comorbidities.

Crohn's disease (CD) can be classified by site of involvement and by clinical behavior. Claims for stability of behavior are based on patients who have had surgery, usually within 8 yr of diagnosis. Disease during this period may begin as inflammatory and may evolve into stricturing or fistulizing behavior. Our aim was to determine the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the prevalence of inflammatory behavior among patients who have had CD for < 8 yr.

Methods

Disease type (inflammatory, stricturing, or fistulizing), site, and duration were determined in 311 consecutive patients with CD. The analysis was then restricted to those with a disease duration of < 8 yr, and influences on the prevalence of inflammatory type disease were compared with those of the complicated type (fistulizing and stricturing), including disease site, family history, Jewish ethnicity, and pack-years of cigarette smoking after diagnosis were determined through univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

The prevalence of inflammatory type disease was 0.63 and 0.3 (p < 0.0001) in patients with a disease duration of < 8 yr and ≥ 8 yr, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a 91% decrease in the odds of inflammatory disease among those with ≥ 1 pack-year of smoking after diagnosis among individuals with disease < 8 yr. This was not influenced by disease location, family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or Jewish ethnicity.

Conclusions

The prevalence of inflammatory CD decreased with time. Tobacco consumption was associated with this decline during the early phase of disease, suggesting that tobacco may influence the progression of inflammatory to stricturing or fistulizing type disease.

### Effect of communicating DNA based risk assessments for Crohn's disease on smoking cessation: randomised controlled trial [^112QN79r]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To test the hypothesis that communicating risk of developing Crohn's disease based on genotype and that stopping smoking can reduce this risk, motivates behaviour change among smokers at familial risk.

Design Parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial.

Setting Families with Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom.

Participants 497 smokers (mean age 42.6 (SD 14.4) years) who were first degree relatives of probands with Crohn's disease, with outcomes assessed on 209/251 (based on DNA analysis) and 217/246 (standard risk assessment).

Intervention Communication of risk assessment for Crohn's disease by postal booklet based on family history of the disease and smoking status alone, or with additional DNA analysis for the NOD2 genotype. Participants were then telephoned by a National Health Service Stop Smoking counsellor to review the booklet and deliver brief standard smoking cessation intervention. Calls were tape recorded and a random subsample selected to assess fidelity to the clinical protocol.

Main outcome measure The primary outcome was smoking cessation for 24 hours or longer, assessed at six months.

Results The proportion of participants stopping smoking for 24 hours or longer did not differ between arms: 35% (73/209) in the DNA arm versus 36% (78/217) in the non-DNA arm (difference −1%, 95% confidence interval −10% to 8%, P = 0.83). The proportion making a quit attempt within the DNA arm did not differ between those who were told they had mutations putting them at increased risk (36%), those told they had none (35%), and those in the non-DNA arm (36%).

Conclusion Among relatives of patients with Crohn's disease, feedback of DNA based risk assessments does not motivate behaviour change to reduce risk any more or less than standard risk assessment. These findings accord with those across a range of populations and behaviours. They do not support the promulgation of commercial DNA based tests nor the search for gene variants that confer increased risk of common complex diseases on the basis that they effectively motivate health related behaviour change.

Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN21633644.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^114mPmk8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Description of included studies

The database search identified 2437 records; 2025 records remained after removing duplicates (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The full-text of 327 records were reviewed, including 96 conference abstracts. Eleven studies were eligible for inclusion: seven reported on Crohn's disease, three reported on ulcerative colitis, and one study reported on both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One included study was published as a conference abstract. One additional study, reporting on the association between smoking and surgery in Crohn's disease, was identified after reviewing references of review articles and included studies. Fair agreement was observed between reviewers for assessment of abstracts (κ = 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.41), and full-text articles (κ = 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.60). Table 1 (Crohn's disease) and Table 2 (ulcerative colitis) outline the characteristics of included studies. A list of excluded peer-reviewed manuscripts and reasons for exclusion are provided in Additional file 3: Table S2.

### Estimating causal effects on a disease progression trait using bivariate mendelian randomisation [^111SUpUo]. Genetic Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

While we have focussed on disease progression, any factor associated with the selection of study participants can potentially introduce collider bias (Paternoster et al.). As in previous work for observational associations (Cai et al.), our approach for MR can be applied more generally when subjects are selected or covariates are conditioned upon. The latter has been previously demonstrated in simulations, but without theoretical justification or consideration of weak instruments (Gilbody et al.).

By working with the marginal genetic effects on exposure, as usually obtained from GWAS, we allow the genetic effect on exposure to depend on disease status. However we have only considered the specific form, and in general different SNPs may modify their effects on exposure in different ways in the presence of disease. This could be encoded with SNP‐specific interaction terms, but they would not be identifiable in the two‐sample scenarios that usually pertain. We can view ourparameter as modelling an average effect of gene‐disease interaction on exposure.

We showed the feasibility of applying our methods to real data by studying the effects of smoking behaviour on Crohn's disease prognosis. Although we did not observe robust evidence for causal effects, the point estimates for smoking cessation were strong, which may encourage current smokers to quit on the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. We have found similar results regarding various types of Crohn's disease progression in other studies, supporting our interpretation (Song et al; Cosnes et al; Lunney et al; Hua et al.).

In conclusion, we use bivariable MR to represent the relationship between risk factors and a disease progression outcome. To deal with weak instrument bias a generalised instrument effect regression model combined with CWBLS adjustment is an effective method to estimate the causal effect, subject to the independence assumptions discussed. These assumptions may be varied by using other MR methods in the bivariate approach.

### Assessing progression of biologic therapies based on smoking status in patients with Crohn's disease [^113neM8h]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Active smoking is a well-established risk factor for developing Crohn's disease (CD) and negatively impacts overall disease progression. Patients who start or continue smoking after CD diagnosis are at risk for poor outcomes, higher therapeutic requirements, and have higher rates of relapse. However, it remains unclear if the exposure to smoking leads to increased sequencing through treatment therapies, especially biologics.

Methods

The Study of Prospective Adult Research Cohort with IBD (SPARC IBD) registry has been collecting patient-reported outcomes data in real-time, as well as laboratory, endoscopic, and pathologic samples from 17 tertiary referral centers since 2016. In this study, we conducted a retrospective review of the SPARC clinical registry collected between December 2016 and January 2021 from 1 participating site, the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program. A total of 619 patients were enrolled in the SPARC IBD database. Four hundred twenty-five patients with CD were included for initial review of completeness of data; of these, 144 patients were excluded due to missing data on smoking status and/or biologic treatment, resulting in a final cohort of 281 patients. We collected and analyzed baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The final cohort was categorized into 3 exposure groups: current, former, and never smokers. Our outcome of interest was number biologics used, categorized into 3 groups: 0, 1, or ≥ 2 biologics.

Results

One hundred seventy-two never smokers, 70 former smokers, and 39 current smokers were identified. Current, former, and never smokers had no statistically significant differences in number of biologics used (ie, biologic sequencing). However, statistically significant independent risk factors for increased sequencing of biologics were identified. These risk factors included female sex, ileocolonic disease location, younger age at diagnosis, and prolonged disease duration; none of these factors remained significant in adjusted analyses.

Conclusion

To date, this is the first study assessing the association of smoking and sequencing of biologics. Although current or former smokers were not found to sequence through more biologics when compared with never smokers, smoking is a well-established risk factor for poor health outcomes, and efforts should be made to counsel patients to quit. Further, additional research must be done to stratify risk to patients based on amount of tobacco exposure.

### Smoking cessation strategies in Crohn's disease [^11312ckz]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although smoking cessation is one of the most effective interventions in patients with Crohn's disease, the prevalence of smoking in these patients is higher than in the general population, and much higher than in patients with other smoking-related diseases. There is a lack of awareness of the benefits of cessation among patients and general practitioners, and a lack of engagement in smoking cessation by specialists. This article discusses the strategies that practitioners can use to motivate patients to quit and how the success of a quitting attempt can be maximised.

### Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease [^116oqFGm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the apparent continuous increase of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in some populations, or some sections of populations such as British children, the origin of these conditions remains obscure. Epidemiological studies of specific risk factors continue to yield contradictory and inconclusive results. However, studies of exposure and comorbidity, coupled with genetic and molecular studies, expand our knowledge and will facilitate more sophisticated research in the near future. Our understanding of the genetic basis of IBD is improving, but genetic anticipation as an explanation for increasing incidence rates appears less probable. The benefit of giving up smoking has been demonstrated in Crohn's disease patients, because smoking influences disease activity. The increased cancer risk in IBD is a concern, but despite this, the overall mortality in IBD is no higher than that of the general population.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^116avSw9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — smoking and disease course and treatment response: In a Spanish national IBD registry (ENEIDA), smoking was associated with decreased survival free of stricturing disease (HR 1.5, 1.18–1.90), perianal complications (HR 1.59, 1.01–2.48), and more complications including surgery (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03–1.40). A meta-analysis reported greater need for surgery (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33–2.12) and endoscopic treatment after surgery (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.63–2.89) among smokers. Anti-TNF data showed lower infliximab response in smokers (22% vs 74%), and at 4 weeks smokers had reduced odds of response (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08–0.41). After endoscopic balloon dilation of strictures, current smoking was linked to further interventions (adjusted HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.11–5.50) and a 5-year cumulative probability of new intervention of 0.81 vs 0.52, difference 0.29 (95% CI 0.07–0.52).

### Effects of light smoking consumption on the clinical course of Crohn's disease [^113VxZQj]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cigarette smoking is associated with a more severe Crohn's disease (CD) course. However, the effect of light consumption is not known. Our aim was to characterize the effect of a light tobacco consumption on the course of CD.

Methods

We analyzed the course of CD during the period 1995–2007 from data collected in 2795 consecutive patients in whom smoking habits were recorded. Patients were classified as nonsmokers (n = 1420), light smokers (1–10 cigarettes/day; n = 385), heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes/day; n = 638), and intermittent smokers (change in smoking habits; n = 352). Patient-years while smoking were compared to patient-years without smoking. The analyses considered patient-years regarding annual disease activity and therapeutic requirements.

Results

The percentage of years with active disease was 37% in nonsmokers versus 46% in light smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.30 [1.19–1.43]) and 48% in heavy smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.68 [1.57–1.81]), despite an increased use of immunosuppressants in smokers. Hospitalization rates were also increased in both groups of smokers, with 12% in nonsmokers versus 15% in both groups of smokers (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The annual rate of intestinal resection was 4.5% in nonsmokers, 5.1% in light smokers, and 5.5% in heavy smokers, with a significant difference observed between nonsmokers and heavy smokers only (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Light smokers are doing worse than nonsmokers regarding disease activity and the need for immunosuppressants. Complete smoking cessation should be advised in all smokers with CD.

### Effect of communicating DNA based risk assessments for Crohn's disease on smoking cessation: randomised controlled trial [^116J7kJ1]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Implications for public health and policy

The results of the current trial provide strong additional support for the hypothesis that communicating risk assessments based on genotype is not effective at motivating smoking cessation over and above communicating phenotype risks such as residual familial risk and smoking status. The results also provide further evidence that communicating DNA based risk assessments does not induce false reassurance. The existing evidence provides no support for the claim that the receipt of results from DNA based tests for gene variants that confer increased risk of common, complex diseases motivates behaviour change. DNA based risk estimates therefore have no role at present in risk reduction strategies aimed at improving population health by motivating behaviour change. This study provides at individual level and regardless of genotype a feasible intervention model based on postal communication of risks and telephone counselling that generalists and specialists might consider to complement the wide range of effective tobacco control interventions delivered at population and individual levels.

Unanswered questions and future research

Research on the behavioural impact of communicating genetic risk information is limited in quantity and quality. Given ongoing advances in genetics, further research may reveal whether patterns of findings observed thus far are consistently replicated across the range of common chronic diseases of middle life and also the contribution of genetic characterisation to the effectiveness of treatment for cessation rather than for increasing quit attempts. Such research should consider carefully for each disease and behaviour the health service context and the appropriate involvement of primary and secondary care practitioners. The use of face-to-face or distance delivery of the risk communication and behaviour change approach should also be evaluated.

Conclusion

The feedback of DNA based risk assessments in smoking relatives of patients with Crohn's disease did not motivate behaviour change to reduce risk any more or less than other types of risk assessments. The results of this trial are in accordance with those carried out in other populations and targeting a range of behaviours besides smoking.

### The effect of early-life environmental exposures on disease phenotype and clinical course of Crohn's disease in children [^112U6DWL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease (CD). In particular, by virtue of the instability of the microbiome and development of immunologic tolerance, early life factors may exert the strongest influence on disease risk and phenotype.

Methods

We used data from 1119 CD subjects recruited from RISK inception cohort to examine the impact of early life environment on disease progression. Our primary exposures of interest were breastfeeding in infancy and exposure to maternal, active, or passive smoke. Our primary outcomes were development of complicated (stricturing or penetrating) disease, and need for CD-related hospitalization, and surgery. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to define independent associations, adjusting for relevant covariates.

Results

Our study cohort included 1119 patients with CD among whom 15% had stricturing (B2) or penetrating disease (B3) by 3 years. 331 patients (35%) and 95 patients (10.6%) required CD-related hospitalizations and surgery respectively. 74.5% were breastfed in infancy and 31% were exposed to smoking among whom 7% were exposed to maternal smoke. On multivariable analysis, a history of breastfeeding was inversely associated with complicated (B2/B3 disease) 0.65, CI 95% 0.44–96; P = 0.03) in pediatric CD. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of hospitalization during the 3-year follow-up period (OR 1.75, CI 95% 1.05–2.89; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Early life environmental factors influence the eventual phenotypes and disease course in CD.

### Effect of communicating DNA based risk assessments for Crohn's disease on smoking cessation: randomised controlled trial [^113QB3tR]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We carried out a parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial in the United Kingdom with 1:1 allocation of participants in family clusters to receive one of two types of risk assessment for Crohn's disease: DNA risk communication or non-DNA risk communication. The former was based on DNA analysis for NOD2 genotype, family history of Crohn's disease, and smoking status. The latter was based on family history of Crohn's disease and smoking status only.

Eligible participants were first degree relatives of probands with Crohn's disease who were aged more than 18 years, did not have a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and smoked five or more cigarettes daily.

### The impact of smoking in Crohn's disease: no smoke without fire [^115QZ8p7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Smoking habit is the most widely accepted environmental factor affecting the incidence and disease progression in the inflammatory bowel diseases. The contrasting effects in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis are unexplained. The purpose of this review is to summarise the existing data on the effects of smoking in CD on disease history, recurrence after surgery, effects on drug responses and to review available evidence that carriage of some of the known susceptibility genes may be disproportionate in smokers with CD. The review also highlights potential mechanisms involved and factors that might affect patients' smoking habits. The clinical and scientific implications of the data are discussed.

### Mercaptopurine versus placebo to prevent recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgical resection (TOPPIC): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^113YVFgQ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of mercaptopurine in the prevention of postoperative Crohn's disease. The primary outcome of clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index > 150 plus 100-point increase in score) and the need for anti-inflammatory rescue treatment or primary surgical intervention, occurred in 13% of patients in the mercaptopurine group versus 23% in the placebo group (adjusted p = 0.07); however, clinical recurrence was significantly more common in smokers, in whom mercaptopurine proved beneficial, with an NNT of three. The secondary outcome of endoscopic recurrence was recorded in a third of patients in each group, with no significant difference between groups; however, in a post-hoc analysis, mercaptopurine was significantly more effective than placebo at maintaining complete endoscopic remission. Although there was no significant difference in the prespecified primary clinical efficacy endpoint, the subgroup analyses provide relevant insights in terms of clinical prediction of response and outcome, and in terms of the challenges in assessing outcome by endoscopic or clinical criteria.

Findings from this study confirm that smoking affects the clinical course of Crohn's disease, as well as response to treatment. Of the factors assessed, the primary endpoint was only significantly different between smokers and non-smokers, whereas no differences were reported by age, sex, a history of previous surgery, duration of disease, previous treatments, or thiopurine status. The data highlight the importance of smoking cessation in disease management and support findings from previous studies, that showed that surgical recurrence increases with the number of cigarettes smoked each day, and that smoking cessation reduces clinical and surgical recurrence. In the present study, treatment with mercaptopurine to delay or prevent postoperative recurrence was particularly effective in people who continue to smoke; thus, in smokers, thiopurine treatment seems to be justified in the early postoperative period. In non-smokers, the data do not provide a sufficiently strong rationale for immediate initiation of treatment in the postoperative period. A considered approach involving colonoscopy in the first 6–12 months is likely to be beneficial in this group.

### Clinical predictors of Crohn's disease course [^115TD4j8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

A modern approach to Crohn's disease (CD) should be influenced by the patient's underlying prognosis. Here, I analyse the clinical factors predicting CD course on the basis of information obtained at diagnosis and in the year following diagnosis. Perianal disease at diagnosis appears to be a strong predictor of unfavourable outcome and has been associated with a more frequent use of immunosuppressive treatment. Early age at diagnosis, ileocolonic disease and extraintestinal manifestations are characteristics of patients at risk for more complicated disease. Otherwise, patients subjected to surgery at diagnosis or during the first year of follow-up appear to have a relatively benign outcome. Disease activity in the year after diagnosis appears to be a good predictor of future disease activity as about two-third of the patients who remain in remission tend to remain unchanged thereafter, whereas those patients treated with steroids have, manifestly, an unfavourable subsequent clinical course. Moreover, there is consistent evidence that active smoking is associated with a complicated disease course. The results of the studies reviewed suggest that the combination of 'phenotype at diagnosis' and 'comportment follow-up classification' in the year following diagnosis can be potentially useful prognostic factors in clinical practice. With the development of newer therapies in CD, there is a growing need to predict disease outcome, despite the difficult challenge in anticipating the future clinical course in a given patient.

### Significance of granulomas in the outcomes of Crohn's disease patients [^114XgpyP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the interesting findings of this study was the inverse relationship between smoking and the presence of granulomas. It has been noted that smoking has a negative association on granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis. Tobacco glycoprotein (TGP) is an immunostimulatory substance that has been isolated from cigarette smoke and is responsible for lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. There has been speculation that granulomas may have a decreased TGP-induced lymphocyte proliferation, hence lower rates of granuloma formation in the smoking population.

This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study limited our ability to elucidate a cause–effect relationship between the different variables. Another limitation was the inconsistency in the number of years of patient follow up. Lack of standardization in the endoscopic (i.e. simple endoscopic score for CD) and pathology reports made it difficult to further analyze associations between the degree of histologic disease activity and the presence of granuloma. Additionally, our study included a combination of endoscopic and surgical specimens; this may have introduced a detection bias, as surgical specimens tend to have higher granuloma detection rates, given the larger surface area resected, and patients undergoing surgery are generally more ill. More studies including only pinch biopsies are needed to uncover such differences. The strengths of this study include the relatively large number of patients from a single institution.

Our study shows that the presence of granulomas in the GI tract of CD patients could be associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype. Even though a cause–effect relationship could not be established, the authors of this study believe that identifying granulomas on endoscopic and/or surgical biopsies should be considered when determining prognosis and used in the risk stratification of CD patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Crohn's disease (CD) has an unpredictable relapsing and remitting course
Non-caseating granulomas are a hallmark histologic finding for the diagnosis of CD
The significance of granulomas in tissue of patients with CD remains controversial in terms of disease prognosis and disease severity

What the new findings are:

The presence of granulomas was significantly associated with the development of intra-abdominal abscesses and/or fistulas
The presence of granulomas was significantly associated with a greater utilization of immunomodulators and immunosuppressive medications
Granulomas may serve as a prognostic biomarker for predicting disease severity in patients with CD

### The truth about cigarette smoking and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease [^114pM7Nv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is generally believed to be multifactorial in nature involving both genetic and environmental factors. Cigarette smoking has been shown through previous retrospective observational studies to be an environmental factor with both positive and negative influences in IBD. Smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) but not the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC). Meanwhile smoking cessation increases the risk of a UC flare while CD patients are more likely to show a decrease in disease severity. Unfortunately, these observational studies cannot control for bias the way a randomized controlled trial can, however, they still reveal meaningful truths about smoking and IBD. The study by Higuchi et al. (1) adds to our understanding of the impact of smoking on IBD in several ways. They showed that increasing exposure to smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing CD. They also showed that the risk of UC is highest in the first 2–5 years after smoking cessation but remains elevated for > 20 years. This research also raises several new issues regarding the association between smoking and IBD, which hopefully will be answered through future well-designed observational studies.

### New studies on the role of smoking in inflammatory bowel disease: are we not beating a dead horse? [^1153u6g7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The role of smoking in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has drawn more interest as our understanding of these diseases has moved beyond the simple designations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In this issue of the journal, Aldous et al. present two papers on the role of smoking in the heterogeneity of IBD. They confirm the findings of many, are at odds with the findings of some, and provide novel observations for us all as we try to understand this complex interaction. Do these studies provide more clarity or just add to the noise? As always, the devil is in the details.

### Tobacco use is associated with accelerated clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission [^114vuuE7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Goals

To study the association between tobacco exposure and postoperative clinical recurrence in Crohn's disease patients and quantify the time to clinical relapse following surgical resection.

Background

It is well accepted that cigarette smoking has a negative impact on postoperative course in Crohn's disease. However, the effect of smoking to hasten clinical recurrence has not been clearly delineated.

Study

We reviewed medical records of patients undergoing surgical resection for medication-refractory disease within a 5-year period. Patients were followed for a period of 250 weeks. Outcomes were compared between smokers and nonsmokers and stratified by gender.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were studied. Sixty-nine percent of smokers versus 23% of nonsmokers had recurrent symptoms (P = 0.02) by the end of the observation period. There was no difference in the mean ages, gender, disease location, use of postoperative medications, or number of postoperative visits (P > 0.09). Smoking was associated with an increased risk of clinical recurrence [odds ratio 2.96 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.5–5.6)]. The time to clinical relapse for smokers was 130 weeks versus 234 weeks in nonsmokers (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Smoking is associated with clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease, and the time to clinical recurrence in smokers is shorter. Strategies for smoking cessation are warranted.

### Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are unaware of the impact of smoking on their disease [^111CSBkb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Backgound

Tobacco is one of the most significant risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Goals

The main objective was to assess the knowledge of patients with IBD regarding the effects of tobacco on their disease. Secondary objectives were to determine the source of their knowledge, the influence of their knowledge on their intent to quit smoking, and the association between patients' characteristics and their knowledge.

Study

Patients with IBD completed a self-administered questionnaire on demographic data, severity of disease, and effects of tobacco on their disease.

Results

In total 259 patients [182 with Crohn's disease, 77 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] participated. The prevalence of current smokers, exsmokers, and nonsmokers was 19.6%, 40.2%, and 40.2%, respectively. Patients with Crohn's disease were more aware of the effects of tobacco on their disease compared with those with UC (57.7% vs. 13.0%, P < 0.0001). In informed patients, the main source of information was the gastroenterologist (56.9%). The intent to quit smoking was superior in informed patients compared with those uninformed (78.6% vs. 47.8%, P = 0.046). Older patients (odds ratio = 0.97, P = 0.01) and patients with UC (odds ratio = 0.11, P < 0.0001) were less likely to be informed.

Conclusions

Only half of patients with IBD are aware of the risks of smoking associated with their disease, whereas their intent to quit smoking is directly related to their awareness. In the scope of IBD's treatment, management of smoking cessation should be undertaken in all smokers.

### Practices, attitudes, and knowledge about Crohn's disease and smoking cessation among gastroenterologists [^112FKyXx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Cigarette smoking is one of the most important, modifiable environmental factors in Crohn's disease (CD) and screening for tobacco use is an official recommendation and quality measure in the care of CD patients. The objective of this study was to learn more about gastroenterologists' practices, opinions, and knowledge in this area.

Patients and Methods

A 15 question survey was sent through email to two national gastroenterology distribution lists. Questions were written in multiple choice formats and were designed to collect information about gastroenterologists' practices, attitudes, and knowledge regarding smoking cessation in CD patients. Responses were stratified by practice setting, experience, and inflammatory bowel disease-focus. Responses were anonymous and were collected in a secure, online database.

Results

A total of 141 respondents completed the survey. Overall, 89% of participants screened their CD patients for smoking more than 75% of the time. In all, 62% provided smoking cessation counseling more than 75% of the time. Overall, 94% of respondents felt comfortable discussing the benefits of smoking cessation with their patients. In all, 56% felt comfortable discussing smoking cessation strategies with their patients. Overall, 88% of respondents agreed that gastroenterologists should provide smoking cessation counseling; however, 43 and 11% agreed that the gastroenterologist should be the primary counselor and primary prescriber of cessation-related pharmacotherapy, respectively.

Conclusion

Surveyed gastroenterologists agree that smoking cessation is an important part of the care of CD patients and this is reflected in their screening practices. Counseling occurs irregularly and many gastroenterologists do not feel comfortable discussing cessation strategies. Future guidelines should provide further guidance on the gastroenterologist's role in smoking cessation counseling for CD patients.

### Antibiotic use and the development of Crohn's disease [^115gu8Rp]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Few environmental determinants of Crohn's disease are well established. Some observational data exist to implicate antibiotic use as a risk factor but these are derived from studies using questionnaires to assess reported antibiotic use that were susceptible to recall bias. We have therefore explored this relationship in prospectively gathered data.

Methods

We selected incident cases of Crohn's disease from the General Practice Research Database with at least five years of data prior to diagnosis. Controls with five years of complete data were randomly selected. Data were extracted on smoking, drug prescriptions, age, sex, and a variety of symptoms and diagnoses that might be indicative of occult Crohn's disease. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between antibiotic use and Crohn's disease.

Results

A total of 587 Crohn's disease cases and 1460 controls were available for analysis. We found that antibiotic use 2–5 years pre-diagnosis occurred in 71% of cases compared with 58% of controls (p < 0.001), and the median number of courses was two in the cases and one in the controls (p < 0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and use of other drugs, antibiotic use had an odds ratio of 1.32 (1.05–1.65). We were unable to show specificity to any subgroup of antibacterials. Associations similar to that with antibiotics were also found with oral contraceptive, cardiovascular, and neurological drugs.

Conclusions

We found a statistically significant association between Crohn's disease and prior antibiotic use. This cannot be explained by recall bias, but due to lack of specificity it is unclear whether it is causal.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^114WyB18]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Although our study provides a comprehensive summary of studies that have investigated the association between smoking and surgery in patients with IBD, it is not without limitations. Firstly, with the exception of disease duration, we did not account for confounding and effect measure modification. The association between smoking and surgery could be influenced by age at diagnosis, disease location, disease behaviour, and/or medications used to treat IBD. Further, ethnic differences may play an additional role on this association, with recent evidence suggesting that the impact of smoking on the development of Crohn's disease varies across ethnicities. Secondly, selection bias in defining the study populations may have introduced bias in our analyses. For example, the association between time to surgery and current smoking in patients with Crohn's disease was significant in population-based studies, but not in tertiary-care centres. Patients followed in the community may be at decreased risk of surgery and possibly less likely to be smokers. Thirdly, while we accounted for disease duration, we were unable to analyze the impact of smoking on the need for surgery at a specific time point in the disease course such as at diagnosis or three years following diagnosis.

### Prevention of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease: what does the evidence support? [^1117bb7x]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients who have undergone intestinal resection for Crohn's disease frequently develop endoscopic and clinical recurrence of their disease. Active smokers and those with perforating disease appear to be at a higher risk of this development. A number of agents have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce the risk of endoscopic and clinical recurrence, but international guidelines are currently ambiguous on which agent should be used. Because there are wide-ranging efficacy estimates, safety profiles, and costs for the various proven prophylactic agents, physicians should personalize the management of individual patients based on their estimated probability of clinical recurrence (low/high). Such risk stratification could be based on the patient's clinical profile with or without early postoperative endoscopic surveillance. Ongoing trials using this "tailored" strategy should provide answers on whether this approach allows optimal selection of proven therapies.

### Mercaptopurine versus placebo to prevent recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgical resection (TOPPIC): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^1173uLLT]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

TOPPIC is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised controlled study of thiopurines for postoperative prevention of Crohn's disease, and the largest interventional study of any kind for this indication, with 240 patients enrolled. We found no significant difference between mercaptopurine and placebo for the primary endpoint of clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index > 150 plus 100-point increase in score) and the need for anti-inflammatory rescue treatment or primary surgical intervention. Smoking was confirmed as the only factor predictive of disease recurrence. A subgroup analysis revealed that mercaptopurine was effective at reducing the incidence of clinical recurrence within 3 years of surgery in smokers, but not in non-smokers (p interaction = 0.018).

Implications of all the available evidence

Combining our data with those included in the previous Cochrane meta-analyses derives a risk ratio of 0.57 (0.38–0.85) in favour of mercaptopurine for the prevention of post-operative Crohn's disease (appendix p 11). We confirm that smoking affects the clinical course of Crohn's disease, as well as response to treatment, whereas no differences were reported by age, sex, or a history of previous surgery. Smoking cessation should be a priority in patients with Crohn's disease after surgery.

### Factors affecting outcomes in Crohn's disease over 15 years [^116WESyd]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The long-term harmful effect of smoking in CD was once again confirmed in our cohort. Of note, smoking was associated with increased disease activity but not with a need for a second operation (table 6). The beneficial effect of a higher educational level was somewhat unexpected, particularly because, in France, level of education has no impact on access to health resources. However, educational level may inadvertently affect complianceand, indeed, non-adherence has been reported in over one-third of patients taking maintenance therapies for inflammatory bowel disease which may negatively contribute to CD management. Better compliance may be achieved in patients with CD with a lower educational level through enrolment in a patient association. Furthermore, a high educational level may be linked to a more cautious lifestyle behaviour and somehow protect patients with CD from environmental triggers.

### Influential factors on disease activity in Crohn's disease and their roc curve evaluation: a cross-sectional study [^114pKTKu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Other influencing factors

In addition to the factors considered in this study, there are other well-recognized factors worth noting that impact the progression of CD. Previous research suggests a correlation between smoking and the deterioration of CD course, with significantly increased clinical relapse rates and repeat surgery rates in persistent smokers compared to non-smokers or those who quit smoking. Therefore, clinicians should pay special attention to patients' smoking status and consider this factor comprehensively when formulating treatment plans. Additionally, studies have found that anxiety, depression, and psychological stress are associated with the disease activity in CD patients. Thus, in clinical practice, assessing and providing support for patients' mental health is crucial. A comprehensive understanding of patients' physical and mental well-being contributes to addressing the multifaceted impacts of CD, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of treatment.

Moreover, the ECCO consensus and the Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease also indicate that factors such as younger age at onset, extensive involvement of the intestine, penetrating or narrowing disease phenotype, perianal lesions, and infections may induce or exacerbate CD. In summary, there are numerous influencing factors in the disease activity of CD, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, considering patients' lifestyles, mental health, diet, and other potential factors is crucial for effectively managing the disease activity in CD patients. Future research can further explore the complex relationships among these factors to provide more evidence for personalized and comprehensive treatment strategies.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^113LXbvM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Smoking cessation in patients with Crohn's disease — 14. Patients with CD who smoke should be counseled to quit. Strong recommendation with low level evidence. Evidence cited includes multiple cohorts and meta-analyses associating smoking with CD risk and progression: a UK population-based cohort showed more than a threefold risk compared with healthy controls (RR, 3.5, 1.8–6.6), a New Zealand cohort reported OR 1.99; 95% CI, 1.48–2.68, twin studies found the smoker twin had CD in 91% of cases with an OR of 10.5 (95% CI, 2.6–92) and discordant pairs demonstrated an OR of 2.9 (95% CI, 1.2–7.1), a meta-analysis reported an OR of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.40–2.22) for current smoking and CD development, and progression data in 1,420 incident patients showed associations with change in disease behavior (P = 0.02), arthritis/arthropathy (P = 0.002), and need for steroids (P = 0.06) or thiopurine therapy (P = 0.038).

### Smoking status and response to thiopurines in steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease [^111QJSVv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The influence of smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility and on its clinical course is well known, but not its impact on drug efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to thiopurines in patients with steroid-dependent IBD according to their smoking habits.

Methods

The medical records of 163 IBD patients (103 Crohn's disease [CD], 60 ulcerative colitis [UC]) in whom thiopurines were started because of steroid-dependency were reviewed. Therapeutic response was defined by steroid-free clinical remission for at least 6 months after 12 months of starting thiopurines. Clinical data and smoking status at diagnosis, at the time thiopurines were started, and during the follow-up were registered.

Results

A therapeutic response was obtained in 72% of CD and 61% of UC patients. Smoking habits did not influence the rate of response to thiopurines, the need for rescue therapies, or the development of penetrating/stricturing complications (CD) or proximal progression (UC). However, CD responders who continued smoking required new courses of steroids more often during follow-up. No influence of smoking was found when these outcomes were analyzed depending on gender or disease location. In the multivariate analysis, smoking status was the only predictive factor of drug tolerance.

Conclusions

Active smoking does not influence the response to thiopurines in steroid-dependent IBD, but may decrease the likelihood of drug tolerance.

### Tobacco dependence and awareness of health risks of smoking in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117RcNz4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Smoking is a risk factor for developing Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its outcome. Conversely, in ulcerative colitis (UC), the onset may be triggered by the smoking cessation and smoking may be beneficial. To help to ascertain whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) would benefit from attending a smoking cessation clinic, we assessed: first, the prevalence of smoking; second, patients' awareness of the effects of smoking, and finally nicotine dependence in IBD patients compared with the healthy and disease-matched controls.

Methods

A total of 246 consecutive IBD outpatients (173 patients with CD, 73 patients with UC) completed a questionnaire on smoking habits and its effect on IBD. Smokers were assessed for dependence using the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) score and their results were compared with those of age, sex, and ethnicity-matched healthy (five controls for each IBD patient) and asthma controls (one control for each IBD patient) attending a smoking cessation clinic.

Results

Thirty five out of 173 patients (20%) with CD and nine out of 73 patients (12%) with UC were current smokers, with 52 out of 173 patients (30%) with CD and 28 out of 73 patients (38%) with UC being ex-smokers. Ninety out of 173 patients (52%) with CD knew that smoking worsens CD, whereas only 15 out of 73 patients (21%) with UC knew of the beneficial effects of smoking on their disease (P = 0.032). Knowledge was unrelated to smoking status. In patients with CD, the median (range) FTND score was 3 (0–8) compared with 7 (2–10) in healthy (P < 0.001) and 6 (2–9) in asthma controls (P < 0.0001). Only seven of the 35 (20%) smoking patients with CD were highly dependent (FTND score ≥ 6). Similarly, in the patients with UC, the FTND score was 1 (0–4), lower than in healthy, [6 (2–10)], and asthma controls, [7 (4–10); (P < 0.004 for both groups)].

Conclusion

Patients with CD were better informed about the effects of smoking on their own disease than the patients with UC. Nicotine dependence in IBD patients is lower than in smokers' clinic clients and comparable with that of the general population. Their low nicotine dependence suggests that most IBD patients could be weaned off the smoking habit successfully in the IBD clinic and referral to a smoking cessation clinic was offered to the highly dependent minority and others expressing interest in attending.

### Current smoking differentially affects blood mononuclear cells from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: relevance to its adverse role in the disease [^11618hxd]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic data suggest that smoking increases the risk and the severity of Crohn's disease (CD), although it may protect patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). To investigate this paradox, we evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke in the function of blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and patients with CD or UC in flare up.

Methods

The production of mediators associated with inflammation but also with protective functions was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), following either in vivo or in vitro exposure to cigarette smoke.

Results

We found that mononuclear cells from smokers with CD were functionally impaired. These cells secreted lower levels of chemokines and cytokines as compared with nonsmoker counterparts, whereas healthy smokers or smokers with UC were not affected. Similar findings were noted after in vitro exposure to cigarette smoke extract. In addition, cells from patients with CD who smoke presented a defective sensitivity to antiinflammatory or antioxidant protection, and particularly synthesized lower levels of cytoprotective Hsp70. The effects observed were not due to diminished cell viability. Our experiments suggest that cigarette smoke-related responses were largely dependent on oxidative stress generated, and not on the nicotine component.

Conclusions

Overall, our data point out the presence of biological differences between blood mononuclear cells from patients with CD and UC toward cigarette smoke that might support its opposite role in both diseases.

### Passive smoking and inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis [^116kvMph]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Active smoking has a well-documented role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the role of passive smoking has been unclear. This meta-analysis examined the relationship between prenatal smoke exposure and childhood passive smoke exposure and the development of IBD.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify observational studies regarding the relationship between prenatal and/or childhood passive smoke exposure and the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and/or ulcerative colitis (UC). Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each relationship.

Results

A total of 534 and 699 potential studies were identified from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, respectively, of which 13 met all of our inclusion criteria. Overall, we did not observe a positive relationship between childhood passive smoke exposure and CD (OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.30) or UC (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85–1.20). Likewise, we did not observe an association between prenatal smoke exposure and CD (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.67–1.80), or prenatal smoke exposure and UC (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.63–1.97).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis suggests that there is not a strong association between childhood passive smoke exposure and the development of CD. We found no evidence that childhood passive smoke exposure exerts a protective effect against UC, as is the case in active smoke exposure. The heterogeneity among the small number of studies limited the ability to draw conclusions about prenatal smoke exposure.

### Does smoking influence Crohn's disease in the biologic era? The TABACROHN study [^116BQx5P]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

While most studies have found a negative effect of smoking on Crohn's disease (CD) phenotype, more recent data have failed to reproduce this association, which might be due to a current wider use of thiopurines and biologic therapy. The TABACROHN study aimed at defining the impact of smoking on CD in the largest published series.

Methods

This multicenter cross-sectional study included 1170 CD patients. Patients were classified as nonsmokers, current smokers, or former smokers according to their present smoking status. Clinical data regarding disease characteristics, treatment, and complications were collected.

Results

Smokers were more frequently under maintenance treatment when compared to nonsmokers. In addition, current smokers presented higher use of biologic drugs compared to nonsmokers. Tobacco exposure and a higher tobacco load were independent predictors of need for maintenance treatment and stenosing phenotype, respectively.

Conclusions

In the era of early and widespread use of immunosuppressants and biologics, tobacco exposure is an independent predictor of need for maintenance treatment, specifically biologic therapy. The wider use of biologics and immunosuppressants could account for the existence of no major differences in disease behavior and complications between nonsmokers and current smokers.

### Clinical epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: incidence, prevalence, and environmental influences [^112ya9E5]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although the incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are beginning to stabilize in high-incidence areas such as northern Europe and North America, they continue to rise in low-incidence areas such as southern Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. As many as 1.4 million persons in the United States and 2.2 million persons in Europe suffer from these diseases. Previously noted racial and ethnic differences seem to be narrowing. Differences in incidence across age, time, and geographic region suggest that environmental factors significantly modify the expression of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The strongest environmental factors identified are cigarette smoking and appendectomy. Whether other factors such as diet, oral contraceptives, perinatal/childhood infections, or atypical mycobacterial infections play a role in expression of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Additional epidemiologic studies to define better the burden of illness, explore the mechanism of association with environmental factors, and identify new risk factors are needed.

### NOD2 and Crohn's disease clinical practice: from epidemiology to diagnosis and therapy, rewired [^1126oi4K]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Correlation Between NOD2 and Other Risk Factors for CD

The main risk factors for the development of CD are smoking, family history, and previous gastrointestinal infections. While the latter's intersection with genetic traits has not been investigated, several studies have focused on the relationship between NOD2, smoking habits, and family history. As should be expected, a 2017 meta-analysis confirmed an equal distribution of NOD2 variants among smokers and nonsmokers. Considering that smoking increases the risk of CD by up to 2 times, the interaction between NOD2 SVs and smoke remains controversial. It was not significant in the works carried out by Mardini et aland Mendoza et al, while a negative interplay was found by de Diego et aland Helbig et al. Noteworthy, the disease history of patients with NOD2 SVs is not influenced by smoking habits regarding the development of complications or the need for surgery. In this respect, Laghi et alshowed that in patients with ileal involvement and without NOD2 variants, smoking accelerates the need for resective surgery. However, this effect was not observed in individuals carrying NOD2 SVs, as smoking had no additional impact. Significantly, concerning the relationship with family history, the presence of at least 1 out of the 3 main NOD2 SVs increases the risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–1.87) of developing CD in first-degree relatives.

### Gender differences in the response of colitis to smoking [^112FdCfE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

The aim of this study was to examine in parallel the effect of smoking on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis and assess the effect of gender on the response of colitis to smoking.

Methods

Medical charts of 1784 adult consecutive patients (978 patients, ulcerative colitis; 118 patients, indeterminate colitis; and 688 patients, Crohn's colitis), whose smoking habits were specified by direct interview, were reviewed.

Results

The proportion of ever smokers was 42% in ulcerative colitis, 43% in indeterminate colitis, and 61% in Crohn's colitis. Smoking cessation preceded the onset of colitis in 279 patients with ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis (61%) and only 52 patients (12%) with Crohn's colitis. In ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis, current smoking delayed mean age at disease onset in men (from 32 to 41 yr; P < 0.001), but not women (from 33 to 33 yr), and decreased the need for immunosuppressants in men (10-yr cumulative risk, 26% ± 4% in nonsmokers vs. 8% ± 4% in smokers; P < 0.01), but not significantly in women. Conversely, in Crohn's colitis, current smoking hastened disease onset in women (from 35 to 29 yr; P < 0.001), but not men (from 32 to 31 yr), and increased the need for immunosuppressants in women (10-yr cumulative risk, 48% ± 5% in nonsmokers vs. 58% ± 4% in smokers; P < 0.01), but not men.

Conclusions

The dual effects of smoking in colitis, beneficial in ulcerative colitis and harmful in Crohn's colitis, are modulated importantly by gender, with women having more disadvantage than men.

### Smoking status at diagnosis and subsequent smoking cessation: associations with corticosteroid use and intestinal resection in Crohn's disease [^112zShzy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of smoking at diagnosis and subsequent smoking cessation on clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been evaluated in a population-based cohort.

Methods

Using a nationally representative clinical research database, we identified incident cases of CD between 2005 and 2014. We compared the following outcomes: overall corticosteroid (CS) use; flares requiring CS; CS dependency and intestinal surgery between smokers and non-smokers at time of CD diagnosis. Differences in these outcomes were also compared between persistent smokers and smokers who quit within 2 years of diagnosis.

Results

We identified 3553 patients with a new CD diagnosis over the study period of whom 1121 (32%) were smokers. Smokers at CD diagnosis had significantly higher CS-use (56 versus 47%, p < 0.0001), proportionally more CS flares (> 1 CS flare/year: 9 versus 6%, p < 0.0001), and higher CS dependency (27 versus 21%, p < 0.0001) than non-smokers. Regression analysis identified smoking at diagnosis to be associated with a higher risk of intestinal surgery (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16–2.52). There was a significantly higher proportion of 'quitters' who remained steroid-free through follow-up in comparison to 'persistent smokers' (45.4 versus 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.02). 'Quitters' also had lower rates of CS dependency compared to 'persistent smokers' (24 versus 33%, p = 0.008).

Conclusions

Smokers at CD diagnosis have higher CS-use, CS dependency and higher risk of intestinal surgery. Quitting smoking appears to have beneficial effects on disease related outcomes, including reducing CS dependency highlighting the importance of offering early smoking cessation support.

### Estimating causal effects on a disease progression trait using bivariate mendelian randomisation [^116ViJ5r]. Genetic Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 Crohn's Disease

Crohn's disease is one of the main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting more than 2.5 million people in Europe (Liu et al.), with increasing prevalence in other countries. GWAS of Crohn's disease susceptibility has been published by the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (Liu et al.). Lee et al. performed a subsequent study of Crohn's disease prognosis, defined as a binary phenotype consisting of good prognosis (indolent disease that requires no surgery or immunomodulators after a minimum of 4‐year follow‐up) and poor prognosis (frequently flaring, treatment‐refractory disease that requires at least 2 immunomodulators, or at least 2 surgeries, or both). Smoking behaviour has been shown to be a critical risk factor for developing Crohn's disease but the association with progression is unclear, varying from positive, negative or no relationship in different studies, due to a lack of uniformity in the definition of smoking status (Parkes, Whelan, and Lindsay). For instance, Aldhous et al. demonstrated that smoking habit was associated with the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, but had little effect on progression to various severe outcomes such as perianal penetrating disease, or time taken to surgery.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the management of Crohn's disease after surgical resection [^116Ate5z]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline — postoperative Crohn's disease (CD) management highlights high recurrence risk and scope: Nearly one-half of patients with CD will require bowel resection within the first 10 years of disease, and one-fourth will require at least another resection within 5 years of index surgery; clinical and endoscopic recurrence can occur in the neoterminal ileum in as many as 90% of patients within 12 months of surgical resection. Endoscopic recurrence is defined as a Rutgeerts' score of ≥ i2 on ileocolonoscopy and the presence and severity of endoscopic recurrence is a strong predictor of clinical and surgical recurrence. Recommendations address postoperative pharmacological prophylaxis and endoscopic monitoring in patients with an ileocolonic anastomosis who are asymptomatic without macroscopic evidence of CD after surgical resection, and they are not applicable to patients with small-bowel anastomoses not accessible by colonoscopy, those with residual disease following surgical resection, or those with perianal disease. The AGA process for developing these guidelines follows the standards set by the US Institute of Medicine and used the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, with quality of evidence a key factor alongside the balance between benefit and harm, patients' values and preferences, and resource utilization; risk factors for postoperative recurrence include penetrating disease, cigarette smoking, and multiple prior resections.

### Gut microbial diversity is reduced in smokers with Crohn's disease [^114gdkjY]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is marked by recurrent episodes of intestinal inflammation and may lead to significant complications and disability. The pathogenesis of this chronic disorder is complex and thought to involve an interaction between host and environmental factors, in which the gut microbiota is considered to play an important role. Smoking is one of the strongest environmental risk factors for CD. It is consistently associated with an increased risk of developing CD. Moreover, smoking has adverse effects on the clinical course with an increased number of relapses and need for medications and surgical interventions among smokers with CD. – Although deleterious effects of smoking on intestinal permeability, the immune system, and epigenetic susceptibility have been reported, the biological mechanisms by which smoking influences the pathogenesis of CD remain unclear.

With the advent of culture-independent techniques for characterizing microbial communities, the role of the microbiota in health and disease has regained interest. Next-generation sequencing methods have provided powerful tools with regard to in-depth analysis of the microbiome. – Accumulating data highlight the potential impact of environmental factors, such as antibiotic use or diet, on the gut microbiota. – Accordingly, it has been suggested that intestinal microbes could be an important link between smoking and CD. Only few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between smoking and gut microbiota in humans. – In a recent interventional study, using different techniques, significant changes were observed in the fecal microbiota of healthy individuals undergoing smoking cessation, including an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum subgroup) and Actinobacteria (high guanine and cytosine content bacteria and Bifidobacteria) and a reduction of Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and Proteobacteria (b- and g-subgroup). A cross-sectional study using fluorescent in situ hybridization targeting selected bacterial groups reported that smoking patients with active CD exhibited different microbial profiles, with higher Bacteroides – Prevotella, compared with nonsmoking patients with CD. Similar results were found in healthy smoking controls, suggesting that the association may not be due to intestinal inflammation but may reflect a direct impact of smoking on the microbiota. These studies were mostly based on the abundance of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. However, it has been shown that quantifying microbial species with 16S rRNA is biased and depending on the region that is being sequenced, conflicting results can be generated, whereas microbiome shotgun sequencing uses all DNA fragments found in a sample to quantify relative abundances of bacteria as well as other organisms. In view of these considerations and the paucity of previous data, this study aimed to compare the gut microbiota composition of smoking with nonsmoking patients with CD, using whole-metagenome sequencing.

### Factors affecting outcomes in Crohn's disease over 15 years [^114kFayv]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Finally, long-term evolution of CD is weakly predictable. New approaches using biomarkers to predict disease course are needed. Moreover, about one-half of the patients from a referral centre will have a mild-to-moderate, long-term evolution and this proportion should be kept in mind when considering treatment strategies. In addition, among factors associated with a severe evolution of CD, smoking remains the most challenging factor for patients to overcome. Lastly, rectal disease should receive major attention in order to decrease permanent stoma, and, moreover, efforts should be attempted to better understand CD progression.

### Passive smoking increases the risk for intestinal surgeries in patients with Crohn's disease [^111pqY1F]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite substantial evidence on the negative effect of active smoking, the impact of passive smoking on the course of Crohn's disease (CD) remains largely unclear. Our aim was to assess passive smoking as a risk factor for intestinal surgeries in CD.

Methods

The study was conducted in a university-based, monocentric cohort of 563 patients with CD. Patients underwent a structured interview on exposure to passive and active smoking. For clinical data, chart review was performed. Response rate was 84%, leaving 471 cases available for analysis. For evaluation of the primary objective, which was the impact of exposure to passive smoking on the risk for intestinal surgery, only never actively smoking patients were included.

Results

Of 169 patients who never smoked actively, 91 patients (54%) were exposed to passive smoking. Exposed patients were more likely to undergo intestinal surgery than nonexposed patients (67% vs 30%; P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that passive smoking was an independent risk factor for intestinal surgeries (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.04–2.9; P = 0.034) after adjustment for ileal disease at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9–4.5; P < 0.001) and stricturing or penetrating behavior at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.1; P = 0.01). Passive smoking during childhood was a risk factor for becoming an active smoker in later life (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5–3.2; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Passive smoking increases the risk for intestinal surgeries in patients with CD.

### Risk factors for surgery in patients with Crohn's disease… [^112rMB2Q]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of Crohn's disease varies from mild disease to frequent, severe exacerbations that require resection. In some patients, symptoms recur even after surgery. Only 12 percent of patients are relapse-free 10 years after diagnosis. Patients who require surgical resection most commonly have medical intractability, internal fistulas, intestinal obstruction, hemorrhage, toxic dilatation or acute perforation. A number of risk factors for postoperative recurrence have been implicated, including age, gender, disease location, preoperative duration of history and presence of granulomas. However, only smoking has been definitively associated with an increased risk of postoperative recurrence. Bernell and associates conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the probability of intestinal resection and the risk of recurrence in a population-based cohort.

Charts of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease were reviewed, and the primary localization of disease was classified into one of six groups. Surgery was defined as any operation leading to intestinal resection. Postoperative recurrence was defined as the first day a patient presented with bowel symptoms consistent with Crohn's disease in which the condition was subsequently verified objectively by a diagnostic procedure, was actively treated, or both. Of 1, 936 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease between 1955 and 1989, 1, 424 required at least one intestinal resection. Disease localization had the greatest impact on the probability for surgery. Patients whose disease was localized to the small bowel or ileocecal area had the highest relative risk for surgery. Those with orojejunal or continuous ileocolonic disease had a relative risk of 1.
8. Patients with perianal fistulas had a relative probability of surgery of

1.

2 compared with patients without fistulas. A patient age between 45 and 59 years at diagnosis was associated with a higher probability of surgery. The authors conclude that three of four patients with Crohn's disease ultimately require intestinal resection, and one half of these patients experience a relapse. Crohn's disease involving any part of the small intestine and the presence of perianal fistulas increase the risk of postoperative relapse. Patients with ileocecal or colorectal disease appear to have a more favorable disease course. A relapse-free period of 10 years following the first resection implies remission maintenance.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^1178wa7V]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease — smoking and counseling: "For CD, there are data to suggest that smoking is associated with (i) development of disease and (ii) disease progression with worse medical and surgical outcomes". Recommendation: "In adults with IBD who smoke, we suggest that they should be counseled to quit (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)".

### Risk factors for postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease with emphasis on surgical predictors [^111rCssC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

The natural history of CD teaches us that surgical intervention cannot cure the disease. The proper management postoperatively is defined by risk stratification. Smoking, prior resection, penetrating behavior, perianal disease, extensive resections, granulomas and myenteric plexitis are well-established risk factors. Patients should be strongly encouraged to quit smoking at the onset of the disease, while a multidisciplinary approach (gastroenterologists, surgeons, pathologists, radiologists) is mandatory. Early endoscopic diagnosis of POR is another key point; therefore, patients should be aware of the intense postoperative follow up that is always necessary. In the future, further details from the genotype-phenotype correlation are expected to clarify the pathophysiology of recurrence, as well as allowing the development of new, more efficient therapeutic protocols.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: the role of environmental factors [^114GMFG3]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Environmental factors are essential components of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primarily responsible for its growing incidence around the globe. Epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence support an association between IBD and a large number of seemingly unrelated environmental factors, which include smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, stress, microbial agents, intestinal permeability and appendectomy. Data supporting the involvement of each of these factors in predisposing to, triggering, or modulating the course or outcome of IBD vary from strong to tenuous. Smoking and the enteric bacterial flora are the ones for which the most solid evidence is currently available. Smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its clinical course, but has a protective effect in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presence of enteric bacteria is indispensable to develop gut inflammation in most animal models of IBD, and modulation of the quantity or quality of the flora can be beneficial in patients with IBD. Surprisingly, evidence for a major role of the diet in inducing or modifying IBD is limited, while that for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is more convincing than for oral contraceptives. Northern geographic location, and a high social, economical, educational or occupational status increase the risk of IBD, an observation fitting the hygiene hypothesis for allergic and autoimmune diseases. Stress is also associated with IBD, but more as a modifier than an inducing factor, and its contribution is more obvious in IBD animal models than human IBD. Finally, an increased intestinal permeability may increase the risk for developing CD, whereas an appendectomy lowers the risk of developing UC.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^114HZuXx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cigarette smoking exhibits a paradoxical relationship with the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with smokers being at increased risk of developing Crohn's disease and at decreased risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Smoking also worsens the prognosis of Crohn's disease by increasing the risk of penetrating and fibrostenotic complications, as well as the risk of disease recurrence following intestinal resection. Quitting smoking after the diagnosis of Crohn's disease is associated with a decrease in the risk of a disease flare. However, studies assessing the association between smoking and the need for intestinal resection in patients with Crohn's disease have reached different conclusions with some demonstrating that smoking increases the risk of intestinal resection and others showing no association. Similarly, studies examining the association between smoking and colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis have demonstrated inconsistent results; some studies suggest that former smokers are more likely to require surgery, while others dispute this association.

A potential explanation for the heterogeneous results between studies may be the time lapse between diagnosis and first surgery. The need for intestinal resection in patients with Crohn's disease increases from 16% in the first year following diagnosis to nearly 50% within a decade of diagnosis. Similarly, the proportion of patients with ulcerative colitis requiring colectomy triples from 5% within a year of diagnosis to 16% after 10 years. Thus, accounting for disease duration may be important when studying associations between smoking and surgery in IBD. Disease duration was not evaluated in previous meta-analyses exploring the association between smoking and surgery in IBD. Heterogeneity may also result from differences in the definition of smoking across studies. Many studies dichotomize exposure to smoking, grouping former smokers with current smokers and comparing them to lifetime never smokers. However, due to the differential effects between former and current smokers observed in many observational studies in IBD, combining groups of smokers may introduce misclassification bias that could mask important differences between current and former smokers.

Thus, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the associations between smoking status (current, former, and never) and first intestinal resection, accounting for disease duration in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

### Is current smoking still an important environmental factor in inflammatory bowel diseases? Results from a population-based incident cohort [^112aUaQv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggest that smoking is an important environmental factor in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), with dichotomous effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between smoking and IBD risk in a population-based database from Veszprem Province, which included incident cases diagnosed between January 1, 1977, and December 31, 2008.

Methods

Data from 1420 incident patients were analyzed (UC: 914, age at diagnosis: 38.9 years; CD: 506, age at diagnosis: 31.5 years). Both inpatient and outpatient records were collected and comprehensively reviewed. Overall, smoking frequency in the adult general population was 36.1%.

Results

Of patients with CD, 47.2% were current smokers at diagnosis. Smoking was more frequent in male patients (P = 0.002) and was associated with an increased risk of CD (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.63–2.37; P < 0.001). In contrast, current smoking was protective against UC (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.41). The effect of smoking was linked to gender (in CD, more deleterious in male patients) and age at diagnosis and was most prominent in young adults, with a difference already being seen in 18- to 19-year-olds. In CD, a change in disease behavior (P = 0.02), location from ileal or colonic to ileocolonic (P = 0.003), arthritis/arthropathy (P = 0.002), need for steroids (P = 0.06), or AZA (P = 0.038) was more common in current smokers. Smoking in UC was associated with more extensive disease (P = 0.01) and a tendency for decreased need for colectomy (P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Current smoking was associated with the risk of IBD. This effect was linked to gender and age at diagnosis and was most prominent in young adults. No association was observed in pediatric or elderly patients. The deleterious and protective effects of smoking on the course in CD and UC were partially confirmed.

### Does nicotine influence cytokine profile and subsequent cell cycling / apoptotic responses in inflammatory bowel disease? [^112z2yHq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking differentially influences susceptibility to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effects of nicotine on cytokine, cell cycle, and apoptotic responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from IBD patients and healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

PBMCs from IBD patients and HC were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 microg/mL) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 5 or 0.5 microg/mL), ± nicotine (1, 10, 100 microg/mL). Cytokines (IL1beta, IL2, IL10, IL12/IL23p40, TGFbeta, TNFalpha) were measured in supernatants at 24 hours. After 72 hours cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis. Statistical modeling was used to identify interactions between cytokines and cell cycle / apoptosis and minimize confounding effects.

Results

Stimulation by LPS and PHA (5 microg/mL) increased IL12/IL23p40 production from CD and UC versus HC (P < 0.05); PHA (0.5 microg/mL) increased IL1beta in UC and decreased TGFbeta from CD and UC (P < 0.01). In all groups, nicotine reduced LPS- and PHA (0.5 microg/mL)-stimulated production of IL1beta, IL10, TGFbeta, and TNFalpha (P < 0.001). Cell cycle analysis showed that PHA, but not LPS, induced proliferation and decreased G(0)/G(1) resting cells in CD and UC versus HC (P < 0.001). Nicotine decreased PHA-stimulated S-phase proliferation and increased G(0)/G(1) resting cells (P < 0.01). Modeling showed independent associations between IL12/IL23p40 and apoptosis (P = 0.01), IL1beta and resting cells (P = 0.006), TNFalpha and proliferating cells (P < 0.001). Disease activity and smoking habit had no effect.

Conclusions

Dysregulated cytokine profiles in UC and CD are associated with specific alterations in cell cycle responses; these effects may be modified by nicotine, and potentially by anticytokine therapies.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and smoking: a review of epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic implications [^116i55wd]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between smoking behavior and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex. While Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with smoking and smoking has detrimental effects on the clinical course of the disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely a disease of nonsmokers and former smokers. Furthermore, cigarette smoking may even result in a beneficial influence on the course of ulcerative colitis. The potential mechanisms involved in this dual relationship include changes in humoral and cellular immunity, cytokine and eicosanoid levels, gut motility, permeability, and blood flow, colonic mucus, and oxygen free radicals. Nicotine is assumed to be the active moiety. The differential therapeutic consequences comprise the cessation of smoking in CD and, so far, clinical trials using nicotine in different forms of application for UC. In this article, we review the relationship between cigarette smoking and IBD, considering epidemiological, pathogenetic, and clinical aspects.

### A prospective study of cigarette smoking and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease in women [^113Kw24g]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of CD or UC confirmed by medical record review.

Results

Over 32 years in NHS and 18 years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was 1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42–2.53) among current smokers and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05–1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61–1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26–1.93) among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2–5 years of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00–4.67) and remained persistently elevated over 20 years.

Conclusions

Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.

### In siblings with similar genetic susceptibility for inflammatory bowel disease, smokers tend to develop Crohn's disease and non-smokers develop ulcerative colitis [^114HFQPC]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Smoking tobacco has opposite effects on the different forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It predisposes to the development of Crohn's disease (CD) yet is associated with a reduced incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC). We have studied sib pairs discordant for both smoking and IBD phenotype (UC or CD) to investigate whether smoking determines the type of IBD that develops in individuals with very similar genetic susceptibility.

Patients

Smoking habits and disease characteristics were analysed in 242 IBD pedigrees (658 patients). Within this group there were 339 affected sibling pairs of whom 89 were discordant for smoking when diagnosed.

Results

Smoking at diagnosis was associated with development of CD (odds ratio (OR) 3.55; 95% confidence limits 2.50–5.02; p < 0.001) in all of the familial patients, with increases when analysed for ileocaecal disease, fibrostenosis, and intestinal resection. Smokers were also protected from UC (OR 0.28; 0.2–0.4; p < 0.001). Of 89 sibling pairs discordant for smoking at diagnosis, 23 were also discordant for disease type-in 21 of these, CD occurred in the smoker and UC in the non-smoker (OR 10.5; 2.6–92; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Smoking is a strong environmental risk factor for Crohn's disease and increases the likelihood of needing surgery. However, sib pairs who are discordant for both smoking and IBD type almost always show CD in the smoker and UC in the non-smoker, and so in some cases tobacco consumption acts on IBD genetic predisposition to shift the phenotype from UC towards CD. The explanation of part of the apparent "protective" effect of smoking on sporadic UC may be that the form of IBD that develops in a proportion of smokers is not UC but CD.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^1141mpPD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was based on a previously published protocol and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Study identification and selection

A structured literature search was performed using MEDLINE (1946 – April 29, 2016) and EMBASE (1974 – April 29, 2016) databases to identify observational studies examining the association between cigarette smoking and the requirement for first surgery in patients with IBD (Additional file 1: Table S1). We did not restrict the search by language, date of publication, or region of study. We hand searched references of included studies and relevant review articles. The following conference proceedings from gastroenterology meetings are indexed in EMBASE and were included in the search: Digestive Diseases Week 2009–2015; American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting 2010–2015; and Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization 2011–2015. Two study authors (MEK and SML) independently screened the full-text abstracts. The kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between reviewers. A third author (GGK) resolved disagreements.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were: (1) an observational epidemiological study; (2) reported on patients with Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis; (3) assessed cigarette smoking and separately analyzed current, former, and never smokers; (4) reported on first abdominal surgery (i.e. first intestinal resection) in Crohn's disease or colectomy in ulcerative colitis; and (5) incorporated disease duration in the analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and/or hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI).

Studies were excluded if (1) they were case series or case reports; (2) assessed the association between smoking and surgery in patients with IBD undetermined (IBD-U) only; (3) reported only on perianal surgeries in patients with Crohn's disease; (4) were unable to differentiate between first surgery and later surgeries in patients with Crohn's disease; and (5) reported only on surgeries required for dysplasia or cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis. We additionally excluded studies where current smoking was used as the reference group to ensure the smoking-surgery association was reported consistently across all included studies. When the same cohort of patients was reported in more than one manuscript, we selected the study with the most complete data.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^113ZLUwH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

After accounting for disease duration, our meta-analysis confirms that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for surgery in patients with IBD, with current smoking increasing the risk of intestinal resection among patients with Crohn's disease and former smoking increasing the risk of colectomy among patients with ulcerative colitis. Additionally, our systematic review identified important gaps in the literature. In addition to accounting for disease duration, future studies examining smoking as a risk factor for surgery in patients with IBD should capture detailed smoking information such as dose and duration, and evaluate potential effect measure modification by factors such as age at diagnosis.

### Attitudes toward smoking and smoking behaviors of patients with Crohn's disease [^112UPwGP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the smoking behaviors of people with Crohn's disease. In active smokers, we measured their willingness to quit, their degree of nicotine dependence, and the proportion that made a quit attempt within 6 months to determine if they were refractory to smoking cessation in comparison to the general population. We also examined factors that were important in their decision to smoke.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of out-patients, supplemented by telephone interviews and a 6-month follow-up questionnaire of active smokers. Measures included disease activity, current smoking behaviors, intentions (stage of change), Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and factors related to their decision to smoke (decisional balance).

Results

The questionnaire was completed by 115 patients (78% response rate). Forty percent were active smokers. Of active smokers, 59% were considering quitting within the next 6 months, and of these, 15% were planning on quitting within the next 30 days. Those with moderate disease activity were more likely to be considering quitting than those with mild or severe activity. Nicotine dependence was rated as high in 33% and as moderate in 43%. Factors unrelated to Crohn's disease were more important in their decision to smoke than were Crohn's disease-related factors. After 6 months, 23% had made an attempt to quit and this attempt was strongly associated with their stated intentions at the baseline questionnaire. Two of three patients who had recently quit at baseline had resumed smoking.

Conclusion

When compared to similar data for the general population, patients with Crohn's disease are no more refractory to smoking cessation.

### Estimating causal effects on a disease progression trait using bivariate mendelian randomisation [^114QpyUR]. Genetic Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

To investigate the causal relationship between smoking behaviour and Crohn's disease progression, we utilised GWAS for smoking initiation and smoking cessation as two different exposures of interest (Liu et al.), including up to 1.2 million individuals. Total numbers of 11,802,365 and 12,197,133 SNPs are recorded in the two GWAS summary statistics datasets respectively. We also used summary statistics for Crohn's disease incidence (5956 cases and 14,927 controls) (Liu et al.) and prognosis (2734 cases) (Lee et al.) that include 7,908,787 SNPs, which were combined and analysed for index event bias in (Dudbridge et al.). To estimate the causal effects, we used a pruned set (≤ 0.1, 250 SNP window) of 131,121 well‐imputed SNPs. This forms a two‐sample bivariate MR, with smoking initiation or smoking cessation as our exposure of interest, Crohn's disease incidence as a disease trait and Crohn's disease prognosis as disease progression trait. The directed acyclic graph is as Figure 2, as smoking initiation and cessation both have potential direct effects on Crohn's disease susceptibility (Parkes, Whelan, and Lindsay; Aldhous et al; Song et al.).

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^114qvkUv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Studies examining the association between smoking and the need for surgery in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have reached inconsistent conclusions. These studies often do not differentiate between patients undergoing early surgery and patients having surgery later in their disease course. Our study examined the association between smoking status and time to first bowel resection in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies (n = 12) reporting on the association between smoking status (current, former, and never) and surgery in IBD, and incorporated disease duration in the analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled across studies using random effects models.

Results

Current smokers with Crohn's disease were at increased risk of intestinal resection compared to never smokers (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.49); however, there was no difference in the need for surgery when comparing former and never smokers (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30). In patients with ulcerative colitis, there was no difference in the need for colectomy when comparing current smokers to never smokers (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.44). Former smokers with ulcerative colitis were at increased risk of colectomy (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.83) compared to never smokers.

Conclusions

Current smokers with Crohn's disease are at increased risk of surgery, while former smokers with ulcerative colitis have increased risk of colectomy.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^113MdiZb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction and study quality

Two study authors (MEK and SML) used a standardized data extraction form to independently extract data from eligible studies, including: study design (e.g. source of patients); definitions and source of exposure to cigarette smoke; time to surgery; study location; sample size; and the association between smoking and surgery (e.g. HRs and CIs). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of individual studies. The scale was adapted to include components of study quality specific to surgical outcomes in IBD (e.g. combining abdominal and perianal surgeries in the definition of surgery in patients with Crohn's disease) and the assessment of proportional hazards assumption in the statistical analysis.

Study design and outcomes

Our primary outcomes were: (1) requirement for first intestinal resection in patients with Crohn's disease; and (2) need for colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis. Both outcomes were compared for current, former, and never smokers.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^115tmHYC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — smoking and Crohn's disease (CD) outcomes — In time-dependent multivariate analysis, smokers had decreased survival free of stricturing disease (HR 1.5, 1.18–1.90), higher perianal complications (HR 1.50; 95% CI, 1.01–1.46), and a higher risk for requiring thiopurine therapy (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.30). A meta-analysis reported in smokers a 56% higher risk of a flare of disease activity and a twofold risk of flare after surgery, with increased need for first surgery (OR 1.68; 95% CI, 1.33–2.12) and second surgery (OR 2.17; CI, 1.63–2.89). Compared with nonsmokers, response to episodic infliximab was lower in smokers (22% vs. 74%) with response (OR 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08–0.41). After endoscopic balloon dilatation, current smokers more often required another intervention than never smokers (79% vs 55%; adjusted HR 2.50; 95% CI, 1.14–5.50), and after 5 years the cumulative probability of a new intervention was 0.81 vs 0.52, difference 0.29 (95% CI, 0.07–0.52).

### Crohn's disease [^113j3Q4q]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

### Risk factors for postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease with emphasis on surgical predictors [^116dfW4F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Patient-related factors

Smoking

Tobacco smoking is, for many reasons, aggravating for CD patients: it is a factor that could trigger the disease in genetically predisposed individuals, accelerate the progression of the disease (shortening the interval between diagnosis and need for treatment with biological/immunomodulators/steroids or surgery), as well as increasing the risk of complications and causing frequent relapses and extraintestinal manifestations.

Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for POR and the only modifiable one; several studies have assessed the effect of smoking on recurrence. Cottone et al, evaluating several variables as potential risk factors for POR in a study of 182 patients, demonstrated smoking (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2–3.8) along with extent of disease (OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.0–6.7) as the only predictive factors for endoscopic POR. As for clinical recurrence, smoking (Hazzard Ratio [HR] 1.46, 95%CI 1.1–1.8), extraintestinal manifestations (HR 1.61, 95%CI 1.0–2.5) and extent of disease (HR 1.57, 95%CI 1.0–2.4) were independent predictive factors, whereas surgical recurrence was associated with smoking only (HR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2–2.3). Unkart et al, in a retrospective observational study of 176 patients who underwent ileocolonic resection, demonstrated an increased risk for a second ileocolectomy (HR 2.08, 95%CI 1.11–3.91, P = 0.023) for smokers at the time of first operation.

### Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes modifying the association between smoking and inflammatory bowel diseases [^113YruYn]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cigarette smoking is a well-established environmental risk factor for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The exact mechanism of its effect remains unexplained. Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes may influence susceptibility to the effect of smoking and shed light on its mechanism of action.

Methods

We used a prospective cohort of patients with CD, UC, and healthy controls. Smoking status was defined as current, former, or never smoking. Patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in CYP2A6, glutathione transferase enzymes (GSTP1 and GSTM1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), and heme oxygenase 1 using a Sequenom platform. Multivariate logistic regression models with CD or UC as the outcome, stratified by genotype, were developed and interaction P-values calculated.

Results

Our study included 634 patients with CD, 401 with UC, and 337 healthy controls. Ever smokers had an increased risk of CD (odds ratio = 3.88, 95% confidence interval = 2.35–6.39) compared with nonsmokers among patients with AG/AA genotypes at CYP2A6. However, ever smoking was not associated with CD among patients with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.001). Former smoking was associated with an increased risk for UC only in the presence of GG/AG genotypes for GSTP1 but not in those with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.012). Polymorphisms at the NQO and HMOX loci did not demonstrate a statistically significant interaction with smoking and risk of CD or UC.

Conclusions

Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes may influence the association between smoking and CD and UC. Further studies of gene-environment interaction in inflammatory bowel disease are warranted.

### Epidemiology and risk factors for IBD [^1159YBhZ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

IBD, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, populations previously considered 'low risk' (such as in Japan and India) are witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn's disease whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.

### Mechanisms of disease: nicotine – a review of its actions in the context of gastrointestinal disease [^111TGXRR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Smoking tobacco is associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders. In some, such as Crohn's disease and peptic ulcer disease, it increases the risk of disease and has a detrimental effect on their course. In others, such as ulcerative colitis, it decreases the risk of disease and can have a favorable effect on disease course and severity. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, nicotine was used as a 'panacea' for various ailments, including abdominal symptoms — it is now under investigation to elucidate its role in gastrointestinal diseases that are associated with smoking. The actions of nicotine are complex; it is likely that its effects on the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and immune system interact with other risk factors, such as genetic susceptibility, to influence disease outcomes. This review focuses on the mechanisms of action of nicotine that might be relevant in gastrointestinal disease.

### Disease-related knowledge and smoking behavior of patients with Crohn's disease [^1115MLWo]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients' knowledge poses effects on quality of life, treatment adherence and coping skills in the management of Crohn's disease. Smoking is the most established risk factor and associated with a more severe course.

Aims

We aimed to investigate the status of patients' knowledge on Crohn's disease in China, and explore the relationship between patients' knowledge and smoking behavior.

Methods

Web-based questionnaires were created including a validated Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge Score applied to all participants and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence to smokers. The sociodemographic data, disease characteristics and smoking status were recorded. Patients were enrolled through invitation emails and Internet advertising. Current and ex-smokers were re-visited 6 months after enrollment.

Results

923 patients completed valid questionnaires with the knowledge score of 12.18 ± 4.61. Disease duration and educational status were independent predictors of the knowledge score by multiple linear regression analysis. The smoking rate was 8.2%. Low knowledge score was related with smoking behavior but not nicotine dependence, and smoking relapse during 6 months after enrollment.

Conclusions

Patients' education should be a priority considering its impacts on many factors including smoking. Extra attention should be given to those from countryside area or having low family income and educational achievement.

### Does smoking cessation reduce surgical recurrence after primary ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease? [^115xHHZ2]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgical resection.

Objective

This study assessed the effect of smoking cessation on long-term surgical recurrence after primary ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease.

Design

A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was conducted.

Settings

Patient demographic data and medical and surgical details were combined from 2 specialist centers. After ethical approval, patients were contacted in case of missing data regarding smoking habit.

Patients

All patients undergoing ileocolic resection between 2000 and 2012 for histologically confirmed Crohn's disease were included. Those with previous intestinal resection, strictureplasty for Crohn's disease, leak after ileocolic resection, or who were never reversed were excluded.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was surgical recurrence measured by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and secondary medical therapy at time of follow-up.

Results

Over a 12-year period, 290 patients underwent ileocolic resection. Full smoking data were available for 242 (83%) of 290 patients. There were 169 nonsmokers (70%; group 1), 42 active smokers at the time of ileocolic resection who continued smoking up to last follow-up (17%; group 2), and 31 (13%) who quit smoking after ileocolic resection (group 3). The median time of smoking exposure after ileocolic resection for group 3 was 3 years (interquartile range, 0–6 y), and median follow-up time for the whole group was 112 months (9 mo; interquartile range, 84–148 mo). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significantly higher surgical recurrence rate for group 2 compared with group 3 (16/42 (38%) vs 3/31 (10%); p = 0.02; risk ratio = 3.9 (95% CI, 1–12)). In addition, significantly more patients in group 2 without surgical recurrence received immunomodulatory maintenance therapy compared with group 3 (12/26 (46%) vs 4/28 (14%); p = 0.01; risk ratio = 3.2 (95% CI, 1–9)).

Limitations

The study was limited by its retrospective design and small number of patients.

Conclusions

Smoking cessation after primary ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease may significantly reduce long-term risk of surgical recurrence and is associated with less use of maintenance therapy.

Fumar tabaco es un factor de riesgo conocido para la recurrencia de la enfermedad de Crohn después de la resección quirúrgica. Evaluar el efecto de dejar de fumar en la recurrencia quirúrgica a largo plazo después de la resección ileocólica primaria para la enfermedad de Crohn. Revisión retrospectiva de una base de datos mantenida prospectivamente. Se combinaron datos demográficos del paciente, así como detalles médicos y quirúrgicos de dos centros especializados. Después de la aprobación ética, se contactó a los pacientes en caso de falta de datos sobre el hábito de fumar. Todos los pacientes sometidos a resección ileocólica entre 2000 y 2012 por enfermedad de Crohn confirmada histológicamente. Se excluyeron aquellos con resección intestinal previa, estenosis por enfermedad de Crohn, fuga después de resección ileocólica o que nunca se revirtieron. La principal variable fue la recurrencia quirúrgica medida por análisis de supervivencia de Kaplan-Meier, terapia médica secundaria en el momento del seguimiento. Durante un período de 12 años, 290 pacientes fueron sometidos a resección ileocólica. Se dispuso de datos completos sobre el tabaquismo para 242/290 (83%). Hubo 169 no fumadores (70%) (grupo 1), 42 (17%) fumadores activos en el momento de la resección ileocólica que continuaron fumando hasta el último seguimiento (grupo 2) y 31 (13%) que dejaron de fumar después de resección ileocólica (grupo 3). La mediana del tiempo de exposición al tabaquismo después de la resección ileocólica para el grupo 3 fue de 3 años (IQR 0–6) y la mediana del tiempo de seguimiento para todo el grupo fue de 112 meses (9 años) (IQR 84–148). El análisis de supervivencia de Kaplan-Meier mostró una tasa de recurrencia quirúrgica significativamente mayor para el grupo 2 en comparación con el grupo 3 (16/42 (38%) frente a 3/31 (10%), p = 0.02; razón de riesgo 3.9 (IC 95% 1–12)). Además, un número significativamente mayor de pacientes del grupo 2 sin recurrencia quirúrgica recibieron terapia de mantenimiento inmunomoduladora en comparación con el grupo 3 (12/26 (46%) frente a 4/28 (14%), p = 0.01; razón de riesgo 3.2 (IC 95% 1–9)). Diseño retrospectivo y pequeño número de pacientes. Dejar de fumar después de la resección ileocólica primaria para la enfermedad de Crohn puede reducir significativamente el riesgo a largo plazo de recurrencia quirúrgica y se asocia con un menor uso del tratamiento de mantenimiento.

### Does cigarette smoking influence the phenotype of Crohn's disease? Analysis using the Montreal classification [^111yfz1z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The clinical subclassification of Crohn's disease by phenotype has recently been reevaluated. We have investigated the relationships between smoking habit, age at diagnosis, disease location, and progression to stricturing or penetrating complications using the Montreal classification.

Methods

408 patients (157 male, median age 29.4 yr) were assessed. Data were collected on smoking habit, age at diagnosis, anatomical distribution, and disease behavior. Follow-up data were available on all patients (median 10 yr).

Results

At diagnosis, ex-smokers (N = 53) were older than nonsmokers (N = 177) or current smokers (N = 178, medians 43.2 vs 28.3 or 28.9 yr, respectively, P < 0.001). Disease location differed according to smoking habit at diagnosis (chi(2) = 24.1, P = 0.02) as current smokers had less colonic (L2) disease than nonsmokers or ex-smokers (30%vs 45%, 50%, respectively). In univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, smoking habit at diagnosis was not associated with time to development of stricturing disease, internal penetrating disease, perianal penetrating disease, or time to first surgery. Patients with isolated colonic (L2) disease were slower to develop strictures (P < 0.001) or internal penetrating disease (P = 0.001) and to require surgery (P < 0.001). Cox models with smoking habit as time-dependent covariates showed that, relative to ileal (L1) location of disease, progression to stricturing disease was less rapid for patients with colonic (L2) disease (HR 0.140, P < 0.001), but not independently affected by smoking habit. Progression to surgery was also slower for colonic (L2) than ileal (L1) disease location (HR 0.273, P < 0.001), but was independent of smoking habit.

Conclusions

Smoking habit was associated with age at diagnosis and disease location in Crohn's disease, while disease location was associated with the rate of development of stricturing complications and requirement for surgery. The pathogenic basis of these observations needs to be explained.

### Genetic factors interact with tobacco smoke to modify risk for inflammatory bowel disease in humans and mice [^116ExJpf]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The role of tobacco smoke in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We investigated interactions between genes and smoking (gene-smoking interactions) that affect risk for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a case-only study of patients and in mouse models of IBD.

Methods

We used 55 Immunochip-wide datasets that included 19,735 IBD cases (10,856 CD cases and 8879 UC cases) of known smoking status. We performed 3 meta-analyses each for CD, UC, and IBD (CD and UC combined), comparing data for never vs ever smokers, never vs current smokers, and never vs former smokers. We studied the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in Il10 -/- and Nod2 -/- mice, as well as in Balb/c mice without disruption of these genes (wild-type mice). Mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 cigarettes per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks, in a ventilated smoking chamber, or ambient air (controls). Intestines were collected and analyzed histologically and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

Results

We identified 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which the association between the SNP and IBD were modified by smoking behavior (meta-analysis Wald test P < 5.0 × 10–5; heterogeneity Cochrane Q test P > .05). Twenty of these variants were located within the HLA region at 6p21. Analysis of classical HLA alleles (imputed from SNP genotypes) revealed an interaction with smoking. We replicated the interaction of a variant in NOD2 with current smoking in relation to the risk for CD (frameshift variant fs1007insC; rs5743293). We identified 2 variants in the same genomic region (rs2270368 and rs17221417) that interact with smoking in relation to CD risk. Approximately 45% of the SNPs that interact with smoking were in close vicinity (≤ 1 Mb) to SNPs previously associated with IBD; many were located near or within genes that regulate mucosal barrier function and immune tolerance. Smoking modified the disease risk of some variants in opposite directions for CD vs UC. Exposure of Interleukin 10 (il10)-deficient mice to cigarette smoke accelerated development of colitis and increased expression of interferon gamma in the small intestine compared to wild-type mice exposed to smoke. NOD2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed ileitis, characterized by increased expression of interferon gamma, compared to wild-type mice exposed to smoke.

Conclusions

In an analysis of 55 Immunochip-wide datasets, we identified 64 SNPs whose association with risk for IBD is modified by tobacco smoking. Gene-smoking interactions were confirmed in mice with disruption of Il10 and Nod2-variants of these genes have been associated with risk for IBD. Our findings from mice and humans revealed that the effects of smoking on risk for IBD depend on genetic variants.

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^117AkwPE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the smoking-surgery association in patients with IBD to incorporate disease duration by including only studies that used time-to-event analyses (Additional file 9). Patients with Crohn's disease who are current smokers are at increased risk of requiring a first intestinal resection as compared to those who never smoked. In contrast, former smokers were not more likely to need surgery for Crohn's disease. Patients with ulcerative colitis who were former smokers were at increased risk of colectomy as compared to never smokers. Current smokers were not more likely to require colectomy for ulcerative colitis.

Similar to our findings, a previous meta-analysis assessing the smoking-surgery association in patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated the increased risk of first surgery among current smokers, but not among former smokers. However, our findings contradict a previous meta-analysis that showed when current and former smokers were combined, smoking decreased the need for colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis. This dichotomization of smoking status (i.e. combining current and former smokers) occurs in the majority of studies examining the association between smoking and the need for surgery in patients with IBD. However, our study suggests that treating current and former smokers as the same introduces a misclassification bias that blurs the separate effects of current and former smoking on the need for surgery.

### Cigarette smoking, coffee consumption, alcohol intake, and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a mendelian randomization study [^116A9bQt]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are widely associated with smoking in epidemiological studies, whereas there are conflicting results for the association between CD and UC for both coffee and alcohol consumption. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether cigarette smoking and alcohol and coffee consumption are causally associated with either CD or UC.

Methods

We utilized 540 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms for 3 potentially addictive substances-nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine-to assess the association of smoking, coffee, and alcohol consumption with CD and UC (12,194 CD cases, 12,366 UC cases, and 25,042 controls of European ancestry), using Mendelian randomization analysis. Mendelian randomization estimates were used to evaluate the effect of the exposure factors on CD and UC risk. Sensitivity analysis was employed to test for any directional pleiotropy.

Results

We found evidence for a positive causal association between the age of smoking initiation and UC risk and between alcohol consumption and CD risk, which disappeared after sensitivity analysis for both associations (P > 0.05). No evidence for a causal association between cigarettes per day, smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and coffee consumption variables and UC or CD was found.

Conclusions

We found no clear evidence that either genetically predicted smoking, coffee consumption, or alcohol consumption are causally associated with the risk for CD or UC, although our findings indicate a potential positive association between the age of smoking and UC and between alcohol consumption and CD.

### Smoking interacts with CHRNA5, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene, to influence the risk of IBD-related surgery [^114tSjfE]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic luminal disease with genetic and environmental factors affecting phenotype. This study evaluated the relationship between CHRNA5, a nicotinic receptor subunit gene, and smoking in predicting IBD-related surgery as well as the relationship between CHRNA5 and nicotine dependence.

Methods

Participants completed a smoking questionnaire and were genotyped for CHRNA5 rs16969968. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records. Wilcoxon, ANOVA, Chi square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for comparisons. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of clinical and genetic predictors on surgery, stratified by disease subtype given paradoxical effects of smoking. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine the effect of smoking and genotype on time to surgery. (Significance: P < 0.05 for main effects; P < 0.2 for interaction terms).

Results

400 (65.8%) patients had Crohn's disease (CD) and 208 (34.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC). 298 (49%) underwent an IBD-related surgery. There was a trend towards significance between rs16969968 and smoking behavior (smoking status [P = 0.05], nicotine dependence [AA > AG > GG; P = 0.08]). Smoking and genotype were not independently associated with surgery in UC or CD. However, interaction between rs16969968 and smoking in predicting surgery was observed for both UC (OR = 2.72; P = 0.05) and CD (OR = 2.88; P = 0.1). CHRNA5 genotype, but not smoking, predicted time to surgery in patients with UC (P = 0.007) but not in patients with CD. The interaction between smoking and genotype was not significantly associated with time to surgery in UC or CD.

Conclusions

The CHRNA5 rs16969968 A variant interacts with smoking to influence IBD-related surgery. 10.1093/ibd/izx094_video1izx094.video15775248538001.

### Risk factors for endoscopic postoperative recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kJMYg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Smoking

15 studies mentioned smoking. Due to low heterogeneity (I 2 = 0, P = 0.902), a fixed-effects model was applied, and the result suggested that smoking was a risk factor for ePOR [OR = 2.06, 95% CI (1.65, 2.57), P = 0.0001] (Fig. 2 A; Table 3).

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^115pAcgp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — smoking cessation outcomes: Smoking cessation was associated with fewer reoperations compared with continued smoking, as those quitting were less likely to have undergone 1, 2, and 3 reoperations for recurrence at any site and less likely to have undergone 1 reoperation for recurrent ileocolic CD. In a controlled trial, 474 consecutive smokers with CD were counseled; patients who quit for more than 1 year were compared with continuing smokers and nonsmokers, with 59 quitters (12%). During a median follow-up of 29 months (8–54 months), the risk of flare-up in quitters did not differ from nonsmokers and was less than in continuing smokers (P < 0.001), while need for steroids and immunosuppressive therapy was similar in quitters and nonsmokers and increased in continuing smokers.

### Effects of active and passive smoking on disease course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^111CfnZw]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking is a remarkable risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), aggravating Crohn's disease (CD) while having beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis (UC). We studied the effects of active and passive smoking in Dutch IBD patients.

Methods

A questionnaire focusing on cigarette smoke exposure was sent to 820 IBD patients. Returned questionnaires were incorporated into a retrospective chart review, containing details about disease behavior and received therapy.

Results

In all, 675 IBD patients (380 [56%] CD and 295 [44%] UC) responded. At diagnosis there were 52% smokers in CD, 41% in the general population, and 28% in UC. The number of present smokers in CD is lower than in the general population (26% versus 35%). No detrimental effects of active smoking on CD were observed, but passive smokers needed immunosuppressants and infliximab more frequently than nonpassive smokers. Active smoking had beneficial effects on UC, indicated by reduced rates of colectomy, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and backwash-ileitis in active smokers compared to never smokers, and higher daily cigarette dose correlated with less extensive colitis and a lower need for therapy. Furthermore, smoking cessation after diagnosis was detrimental for UC patients, indicated by increased needs for steroids and hospitalizations for patients that stopped smoking after compared to before the diagnosis.

Conclusions

Active smoking is a risk factor for CD, but does not affect the outcome; passive smoking is detrimental for the outcome of CD patients. In UC, active smoking shows dose-dependent beneficial effects. Our data suggest that passive smoking is a novel risk factor for CD.

### Effect of communicating DNA based risk assessments for Crohn's disease on smoking cessation: randomised controlled trial [^116Tbrza]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Among relatives of patients with Crohn's disease, feedback of DNA based risk assessments did not motivate behaviour change to reduce the risk of Crohn's disease any more or less than standard risk assessments. DNA based risk assessments had no significant effects on either primary or secondary outcomes and none of the trial hypotheses was supported. There was little evidence that the intervention caused harm, with only one individual reporting concern, which was readily alleviated.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

The paradigm of Crohn's disease offers several distinct advantages in relation to previous studies on the effects of information about genetic risk on health behaviour, concerning precision of information and generalisation to other disorders. Recent advances make it possible to offer people relatively precise information about their risk of developing Crohn's disease. Importantly, the specific effects of smoking on this baseline risk are well estimated. Furthermore, the risks of Crohn's disease conferred by common sequence variantswere in the range expected and observed for other common, complex conditions, with most participants being at relatively low risk. This increased the possibility of our findings being generalisable beyond the example of Crohn's disease, to include the wide range of common, complex conditions for which testing is now being offered inside and outside of healthcare settings.

### Smoking cessation for Crohn's disease: clearing the haze [^113SpnGc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The TABACROHN Study Group conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study, demonstrating that smoking cessation improved the prognosis of Crohn's disease. Patients who continued to smoke were 50% more likely to relapse compared with non-smokers. Smoking cessation reduced the risk of flaring, regardless of exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. Despite the evidence that smoking cessation is beneficial, many patients do not quit smoking after their diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Lack of awareness, physical addiction, and social context of smoking inhibit smoking cessation. In spite of this, comprehensive smoking cessation programs have been shown to be effective and reduce costs.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^113JGJxE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — smoking and anti-TNF therapy response: In a meta-analysis including 18 observational studies and three RCTs, current smokers and nonsmokers (never or former) had similar rates of clinical response in observational studies (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88–1.05) and in RCTs (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84–1.41); when smoking exposure was clearly defined (≥ 5 cigarettes per day for ≥ 6 months), smokers treated with anti-TNF were less likely to achieve clinical response (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48–0.83), and lifetime never smokers vs ever smokers excluding former smokers was protective of clinical response (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71–0.93). Current smokers were also less likely to achieve clinical remission in observational studies (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57–0.98), although this association was not seen in RCTs (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89–1.21).

### Smoking influences the need for surgery in patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating disease duration [^113Ca7nB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

We restricted our analysis to studies that accounted for disease duration in order to allow for the potential differential effects of smoking on surgery over time. Studies that do not incorporate disease duration treat patients with IBD who undergo surgery three years following diagnosis in the same fashion as those who will require surgery 15 years after diagnosis. When incorporating time, our meta-analysis showed that former smokers with ulcerative colitis were at increased risk of colectomy compared to never smokers. In contrast, a prior meta-analysis that did not use a time-to-event analysis showed no difference in the odds of colectomy for former and never smokers.

Our systematic review identified a paucity of primary studies that examined the effect of more refined definitions of smoking (e.g. dose, duration, and cumulative exposure) or treated smoking as a time-varying covariate. Consequently, we were not able to meaningfully incorporate these elements of smoking into our meta-analysis. These are important considerations because prognosis improves after quitting smoking and the risk of a negative outcome (e.g. disease flare) decreases with time among patients with Crohn's disease. Future primary studies should consider potential differences between light, moderate, and heavy smokers, as well as potential differences in duration of smoking and cumulative exposure to cigarette smoke (e.g. pack years).

Our systematic review identified one study that stratified the smoking-surgery association by age at diagnosis. This study showed that smoking at diagnosis increased the risk of surgery for Crohn's disease patients diagnosed after the age of 40, but not for those diagnosed before age 40. In contrast, ulcerative colitis patients diagnosed between the ages of 17 and 40 years and who quit smoking prior to their diagnosis were more likely to undergo a colectomy, but this association was not observed among patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis after the age of 40 years. In our sensitivity analysis, smoking remained associated with surgery for Crohn's disease when we included the age-specific risk estimates. In contrast, smoking was only associated with the need for colectomy when we included the risk estimate for patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis before 40 years of age. Future studies may need to account for age at diagnosis when exploring a relationship between smoking and surgery for IBD.

### Results and risk factors of side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty in Crohn disease… [^115yM8Ps]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Oral informed consent was obtained from the study participants. At the time of first surgery, 34 patients were smokers, 23 were former smokers, and 34 had never smoked. The main indication for surgery was bowel obstruction in 68 cases, malnutrition in 11 patients, and fistula and/or abscess in 12 patients. Twelve patients of 24 experienced recurrence after more than 5 years, during which they experienced well-being and good condition. The postoperative global recurrence and the surgical or medical recurrence at the SSIS site were analyzed. The frequency of global recurrence was lower in former smokers compared with active smokers or those who had never smoked. Those with recurrence also had a significantly shorter time between diagnosis and surgery. Instead, patients with surgical recurrence in SSIS had a significantly shorter time between diagnosis and surgery.

Moreover, former smokers had a significantly lower risk for recurrence compared with smokers and those patients who had never smoked. When analyzing the risk factors associated with surgical recurrence in SSIS alone, we found a reduced risk in patients without a family history of CD and with a disease localization in the distal part of the small bowel. It is of interest that former smokers had a significantly lower recurrence rate.
