## Question

Amphetamine antidote

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a specific antidote for amphetamine overdose and, if not, what the evidence-based management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any authoritative sources list a true antidote. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for why an antidote might not exist. Next, I will review the recommended symptomatic management, including benzodiazepines, antihypertensives, and decontamination. After that, I need to check special scenarios like serotonin syndrome and co-ingestions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and practical guidance, making sure I double-check any historical or controversial therapies before recommending them.

> Let me first confirm the core question: is there a specific antidote for amphetamine overdose. Multiple FDA labeling documents consistently state that management of amphetamine overdose is supportive and symptomatic, and they explicitly note that d-amphetamine is not dialyzable, with no mention of any antidote, which strongly implies there is no specific reversal agent for amphetamines [^111tkzbs] [^114bzQBe] [^111ZENaz] [^112Z1CZR] [^112avuKU] [^1138ZwmZ] [^114M3uTz] [^1111dbH1] [^11228muy] [^114UjWK7] [^116564hd] [^111VEALK] [^114QDbha].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale before concluding. Amphetamines exert toxicity via indirect sympathomimetic effects: releasing norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and inhibiting reuptake, producing a hyperadrenergic toxidrome; there is no single receptor or pathway amenable to a simple competitive antagonist like naloxone for opioids, which explains the absence of a specific antidote and the reliance on supportive care to blunt sympathetic overactivity and prevent complications [^113iu7sM].

> I will now examine the recommended first-line symptomatic therapy. Hold on, I should verify whether benzodiazepines are truly first-line for agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms. The ASAM/AAAP guideline recommends GABAergic agents, with benzodiazepines as first-line, to control hyperadrenergic symptoms and agitation; this aligns with broader toxicology principles for sympathomimetic toxicity and is supported by clinical experience and pediatric data showing benzodiazepines control agitation and reduce seizure risk, though high-quality randomized trials are limited [^116Fw7z6] [^114g5Kzi].

> Next, I should review blood pressure management. For severe hypertension or hypertensive emergency in stimulant toxicity, phentolamine, a nonselective alpha-blocker, is an accepted option. The ACC/AHA guidance includes phentolamine for hypertensive emergencies induced by catecholamine excess, including amphetamine overdose, and case literature supports its use in mixed toxicities with delayed hypertensive complications, while labetalol or nitroprusside are reasonable alternatives when alpha-blockade is insufficient or contraindicated [^114MkXtK] [^113eniaH].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal decontamination. Activated charcoal may be used if the patient presents within about 1 hour of ingestion and is protecting their airway. I need to ensure I don't overstate its role, as modern labeling emphasizes supportive care and notes amphetamine is not dialyzable, and older literature mentioning gastric lavage and cathartics reflects outdated practice and should be interpreted cautiously [^114bzQBe] [^111ZENaz] [^111tkzbs].

> I should double-check hyperthermia and metabolic complications. Active cooling, aggressive IV fluids, and monitoring for rhabdomyolysis with urine output goals and renal function checks are essential; this is consistent with the pathophysiology of life-threatening hyperthermia and muscle breakdown reported in amphetamine overdose, and aligns with general critical care principles for stimulant toxicity [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there is serotonin syndrome. If serotonin syndrome is suspected, supportive care remains foundational. Cyproheptadine can be considered as a serotonergic antagonist, and case reports describe dexmedetomidine as an adjunct for severe agitation in serotonin toxicity, though evidence is limited and benzodiazepines are still a mainstay. I need to ensure I distinguish serotonin syndrome from pure sympathomimetic toxicity by looking for neuromuscular features such as clonus and hyperreflexia [^115xUHcX] [^116mrEar] [^117RKxiD].

> Hold on, I should verify co-ingestion considerations. Given the high prevalence of opioid–stimulant co-use, always consider and treat suspected opioid involvement with naloxone; naloxone will not reverse amphetamine effects, but it addresses the opioid component that may contribute to respiratory depression and death, so it is appropriate to administer when opioid co-ingestion is possible or suspected [^116dBGZ9] [^112HJmqE] [^112QGmLm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if antipsychotics might serve as an antidote because older labeling mentions chlorpromazine for amphetamine poisoning. Let me reconsider that. While chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics can mitigate stimulant-induced psychosis and agitation, they are not true antidotes and carry risks such as QT prolongation, lowered seizure threshold, and impaired heat dissipation; a systematic review shows no clear benefit over benzodiazepines and signals of potential harm, so benzodiazepines remain preferred first-line for agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms, with antipsychotics reserved for refractory cases and with caution [^111tkzbs] [^1124cJWT] [^115xV5kB].

> Next, I should review setting of care and disposition. Severe intoxication with complications such as hyperthermia, severe hypertension, seizures, or hemodynamic instability warrants acute care, while carefully selected patients with mild symptoms and reliable follow-up may be managed in lower-acuity settings. Ongoing monitoring of vital signs and suicidality is crucial as intoxication wanes and withdrawal or psychiatric symptoms emerge [^114iBZQm] [^115YJ492] [^111R1ixZ].

> I need to ensure I close the loop on the original question. Conclusion: there is no specific antidote for amphetamine overdose. Management is supportive and symptomatic, anchored by benzodiazepines for agitation and hyperadrenergic symptoms, antihypertensives such as phentolamine for severe hypertension, active cooling and fluids for hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, and early consideration of co-ingestants including opioids, with early toxicology consultation and decontamination when appropriate and safe [^111tkzbs] [^116Fw7z6] [^114MkXtK] [^112HJmqE].

---

There is **no specific antidote** for amphetamine overdose; management is **supportive care** with benzodiazepines for agitation and seizures, antihypertensives for severe hypertension, and aggressive cooling for hyperthermia. Urinary acidification is **not recommended** due to risk of renal failure from myoglobinuria. Early toxicology consultation and continuous monitoring are essential to guide care and detect complications [^114bzQBe] [^1164aXZ9].

---

## Clinical presentation of amphetamine overdose

Amphetamine overdose presents with a characteristic **sympathomimetic toxidrome**, including:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Tachyarrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, vasospasm, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^114bzQBe] [^114QDbha].

- **Central nervous system effects**: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations, serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma [^114bzQBe] [^112avuKU].

- **Metabolic effects**: Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures > 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis [^114bzQBe] [^112avuKU].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Amphetamines increase synaptic concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin by promoting release and inhibiting reuptake, leading to **sympathomimetic toxicity**. There is **no specific pharmacological antagonist** that reverses these effects, and no antidote has been identified.

---

## Current management strategies

Management of amphetamine overdose is primarily **supportive**, targeting symptom control and complication prevention:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Agitation, seizures | Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam) [^116Fw7z6] [^114g5Kzi] |
| Severe hypertension | - Antihypertensives (phentolamine, nitroprusside, nicardipine) [^114MkXtK] [^113eniaH] |
| Hyperthermia | - Aggressive cooling <br/> - Supportive care [^1172ozHJ] |
| Rhabdomyolysis | - Intravenous fluids <br/> - Urine alkalinization (not urinary acidification) [^1172ozHJ] [^111tkzbs] |
| Serotonin syndrome | - Supportive care <br/> - Benzodiazepines <br/> - Cyproheptadine if indicated [^115xUHcX] [^116mrEar] |

---

## Historical and experimental antidotes

Historically, **urinary acidification** was considered to enhance amphetamine elimination, but it is no longer recommended due to the risk of acute renal failure from myoglobinuria. Experimental approaches, such as nano-antidotes, remain in preclinical stages and are not available for clinical use [^115ahdfW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **supportive care** and symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are **first-line** for agitation and seizures; antihypertensives are indicated for severe hypertension; and aggressive cooling is essential for hyperthermia. Early toxicology consultation and continuous monitoring are recommended to guide care and detect complications [^116Fw7z6] [^1164aXZ9] [^114bzQBe].

---

## Potential risks and complications of antidotal therapy

Given the absence of a specific antidote, **risks arise from inappropriate management strategies**, such as urinary acidification, which can precipitate renal failure. Antipsychotics should be used cautiously due to risks of QT prolongation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and impaired heat dissipation [^115xV5kB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no specific antidote** for amphetamine overdose. Management is supportive and symptom-targeted, with benzodiazepines, antihypertensives, and aggressive cooling as mainstays. Urinary acidification is not recommended, and experimental therapies remain investigational. Early toxicology consultation and continuous monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes [^114bzQBe] [^116Fw7z6].

### Nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in emergency departments-29 States, 2018–2019 [^116dBGZ9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The U.S. drug overdose epidemic continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality. In 2017, 967,615 nonfatal drug overdoses were treated in emergency departments (EDs), a 4.3% increase from 2016 in all overdoses and a 3.1% increase in opioid-involved overdoses (1). During 2017 and 2018, syndromic surveillance revealed that 37.2% of overdoses treated in EDs in 18 states involved multiple drugs (2). To describe changes in rates and proportions of suspected nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in EDs, CDC analyzed syndromic surveillance data from 2018 to 2019 in 29 states. Rates of overdoses involving opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines increased 9.7%, 11.0%, and 18.3%, respectively, and the rate of benzodiazepine-involved overdoses decreased 3.0%. Overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines increased from 2018 to 2019, overall, in both sexes, and in most age groups. In 2019, 23.6%, 17.1%, and 18.7% of overdoses involving cocaine, amphetamine, and benzodiazepines, respectively, also involved opioids. Expanding overdose prevention, treatment, and response efforts is needed to reduce the number of drug and polydrug overdoses. This includes linkage into treatment, harm reduction services, and community-based programs for persons who use drugs; expanding overdose prevention efforts, including increased naloxone provision, to persons who use stimulants; addressing the illicit drug supply; and identifying specific risk factors for populations using these drugs. Continued surveillance with expanded coverage of additional jurisdictions of the evolving drug overdose epidemic is important to the success of these efforts.

### Drug overdose deaths involving stimulants-United States, January 2018-June 2024 [^111TdGcR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data Sources

SUDORS † funds 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) to report data on unintentional and undetermined intent drug overdose deaths from death certificates, postmortem toxicology reports, and medical examiner or coroner reports under CDC's Overdose Data to Action in States program. § SUDORS defines stimulants as cocaine, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, synthetic cathinones, prescription stimulants, and any other central nervous system stimulants.

NVSS †† collects death certificate data for all deaths in the United States and can be used to assess national trends in overdose death rates. In NVSS, overdose deaths were identified through International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unintentional) and Y10–14 (undetermined intent) and multiple cause-of-death codes for cocaine (T40.5); psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43.6 [psychostimulants]), which primarily includes methamphetamine and other amphetamines; and opioids (T40.0–T40.4 and T40.6). In NVSS, the categories of cocaine and psychostimulants with abuse potential combined are referred to as stimulants.

Statistical Analysis

For SUDORS data, percentages of overdose deaths during January 2021–June 2024 involving §§ any stimulant, and methamphetamine and cocaine as specific stimulants, were calculated and stratified by opioid co-involvement. Within strata, percentages by demographic characteristics and circumstances were calculated.

For NVSS data, annual age-adjusted rates (rates) of stimulant-involved overdose deaths during 2018–2023 were calculated overall and by race and ethnicity. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. *

### Naloxone use during pregnancy-data from 26 US jurisdictions, 2019–2020 [^113jFyr5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the prevalence of self-reported naloxone use during pregnancy among people in the United States with a recent live birth. A secondary objective was to characterize people at increased risk of overdose who did and did not use naloxone.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from 26 US jurisdictions that conducted an opioid supplement survey from 2019 to 2020. Respondents with increased risk of experiencing an opioid overdose were identified based on self-reported use of illicit amphetamines, heroin, cocaine, or receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy. Weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for reported naloxone use at any point during pregnancy among people with an increased risk of overdose.

Results

Naloxone use during pregnancy was reported by < 1% of the overall study population (unweighted N = 88/34,528). Prevalence of naloxone use was 5.0% (95% CI: 0.0–10.6) among respondents who reported illicit amphetamine use, 15.2% (1.8–28.6) among those who reported heroin use, and 17.6% (0.0–38.1) among those who reported cocaine use. Naloxone use was 14.5% (8.4–20.6) among those who reported taking MOUD. Among people with increased risk of overdose, no significant differences in naloxone use were observed by age, race/ethnicity, education level, residential metropolitan status, or insurance status.

Conclusions

Prevalence of naloxone use among people with an increased risk of overdose during pregnancy ranged from 5.0% to 17.6%. Access to naloxone, overdose prevention education, and treatment for substance use disorders may help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Serotonin syndrome associated with vilazodone overdose in a 22-month-old treated with dexmedetomidine [^117RKxiD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vilazodone was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 as a treatment for major depression disorder. Vilazodone is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A agonist used in the treatment of depression in adults. Vilazodone increases the availability and activity of serotonin and its neural pathways. Vilazodone blocks the serotonin reuptake pump and desensitizes serotonin receptors (especially 5HT1A autoreceptors), therefore increasing serotonergic neurotransmission. Its partial agonist actions at presynaptic somatodendritic 5HT1A autoreceptors theoretically enhance serotonergic activity, contributing to antidepressant actions. There are limited reports exploring its effects in children after unintentional ingestion. Typical adult dosing is titrated from an initial dose of 10 mg up to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily. Serotonin syndrome classically manifests with restlessness, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mydriasis, and increased tone, and is typically treated with benzodiazepines, cyproheptadine, and supportive care. Dexmedetomidine has also been used in case reports to treat serotonin syndrome.

Case Report

We report the case of a toddler with a laboratory-confirmed vilazodone overdose exhibiting symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including restlessness, hyperthermia, mydriasis, dystonia, agitation, seizure-like activity, roving eye movement, tachycardia, and elevated creatine kinase. The patient was admitted and initially treated with supportive care and lorazepam per recommendations of the poison center, which did not recommend cyproheptadine use. On decompensation with suspected serotonin syndrome, the patient was treated with dexmedetomidine. In addition, urine toxicology screening (Amphetamines II assay; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was positive for amphetamines; however, confirmatory testing (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) was negative. The patient improved and was discharged after returning to her baseline status at 74 h post ingestion. Importantly, this patient did not require intubation and mechanical intubation, in spite of the large amount of vilazodone ingested. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With increasing prescription of vilazodone, emergency physicians should have a high level of suspicion so as not to miss this toxidrome. The possibility of false-positive amphetamine screenings when an overdose of vilazodone is suspected should be investigated. Finally, systematic evaluation of the use of dexmedetomidine as treatment for serotonin syndrome or vilazodone ingestion should be done to confirm efficacy.

### Evaluation of amphetamine-related hospitalizations and associated clinical outcomes and costs in the United States [^114Zy28F]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Sample

The sample included hospitalizations between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2015, of US adults (aged 18 years or older). We identified amphetamine-related hospitalizations using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for amphetamine dependence or abuse (304.40–304.42, 305.70–305.72) or amphetamine poisoning (969.72). We excluded diagnostic codes for amphetamine dependence or abuse in remission (304.43 and 305.73) to limit the sample to individuals who were currently using amphetamines. Hospitalizations were defined as amphetamine-related if a diagnosis code for amphetamine dependence or abuse or amphetamine poisoning was listed in any diagnosis position. This approach is consistent with the methods from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for identifying chronic or potentially disabling conditions in hospital billing data. Diagnostic codes do not discriminate between methamphetamine use, other illicit amphetamine use, and nonmedical use of prescription amphetamines, but evidence indicates that such codes primarily represent methamphetamine use. Data from ED visits suggest that methamphetamine use composes most of the acute care visits related to amphetamines. For example, methamphetamine accounts for 102 961 (64.4%) of 159 840 amphetamine-related ED visits, and ED visits associated with methamphetamine are approximately 3 times as prevalent as ED visits for prescription amphetamines (102 961 vs 31 244 visits). In addition, diagnoses (eg, endocarditis) that are common among individuals who inject methamphetamine, but not as prevalent among those with nonmedical use of prescription amphetamines, are associated with amphetamine-related diagnostic codes.

We described a number of characteristics of the sample, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, income quartile of patient zip code, hospital census region, other types of co-occurring substance use (eg, alcohol; cannabis; opioids; cocaine; hallucinogens; sedatives, tranquilizers, or hypnotics), and drug-induced mental disorders. We modified the ICD-9-CM coding schemes developed by HCUP to define additional substance-related categories (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

We also assessed the 15 most common primary diagnoses among amphetamine-related hospitalizations to illustrate the comorbidities typically associated with amphetamine use. We used ICD-9-CM codes to identify hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of amphetamine dependence or abuse, amphetamine poisoning, or substance use–induced mental disorder. We categorized all other primary diagnoses according to HCUP Clinical Classifications Software for ICD-9-CM.

### Dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, and amphetamine sulfate (Mydayis) [^115d7KrK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Educate patients and their families about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction of MYDAYIS, which can lead to overdose and death, and proper disposal of any unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2), Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to store MYDAYIS in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give MYDAYIS to anyone else.

Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death with MYDAYIS use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Instruct patients that MYDAYIS can cause elevations of their blood pressure and pulse rate and they should be monitored for such effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Advise patients that MYDAYIS, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms even in patients without prior history of psychotic symptoms or mania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

Advise patients, family members, and caregivers that MYDAYIS may cause slowing of growth including weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Circulation Problems in Fingers and Toes [Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud's Phenomenon]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with MYDAYIS about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking MYDAYIS. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Mortality among people with regular or problematic use of amphetamines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11639SLp]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Amphetamines are the second most commonly used class of illicit drugs. We aimed to produce pooled estimates of mortality risks among people with regular or dependent use of amphetamines, with a focus upon all-cause mortality as well as specific causes of death.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts of people with problematic use or dependence on amphetamines with data on all-cause or cause-specific mortality.

Setting and Participants

Of 4240 papers, 30 were eligible, reporting on 25 cohorts that measured all-cause mortality, drug poisoning, suicide, accidental injuries, homicide and cardiovascular mortality. Cohorts (n = 35–74139) were in North America, several Nordic countries and Asia Pacific.

Measurement

Titles/abstracts were independently screened by one reviewer and excluded those reviewed by a second reviewer. Full-text screening was by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on crude mortality rates (CMR) per 100 person-years (py), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). We imputed SMRs where possible if not reported by study authors. We also calculated mortality relative risks. Data were pooled using random-effects models; potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored using subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.

Findings

Twenty-three cohorts contributed data for the pooled all-cause CMR: 1.14 per 100 py [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.92–1.42]. Pooled cause-specific mortality rates were: drug poisoning, 0.14 per 100 py (95% CI = 0.06–0.34); cardiovascular disease, 0.13 per 100 py (95% CI = 0.06–0.29); suicide, 0.20 per 100 py (95% CI = 0.07–0.55); accidental injury, 0.20 per 100 py (95% CI = 0.08–0.47) and homicide, 0.03 per 100 py (95% CI = 0.02–0.06). There was substantial heterogeneity for all pooled CMR estimates except homicide. The pooled all-cause SMR was 6.83 (95% CI = 5.27–8.84). Pooled cause-specific SMRS were: poisoning, 24.70 (95% CI = 16.67, 36.58); homicide, 11.90 (95% CI = 7.82–18.12); suicide, 12.20 (95% CI = 4.89–30.47); cardiovascular disease, 5.12 (95% CI = 3.74–7.00) and accidental injury, 5.12 (95% CI = 2.88–9.08).

Conclusions

People with regular or dependent amphetamine use are at elevated risk of a range of causes of mortality compared with people without regular or dependent amphetamine use.

### An age-period-cohort-interaction analysis of meth / amphetamine-related deaths in Australia, 2001–2020 [^117Mvg1R]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States (US), APC research has found there has been a generational shift in drug overdose (including meth/amphetamine) mortality to younger, non‐white populations with each 'wave' of the overdose crisis. APC research also indicates the historical trend of declining rates of high‐risk meth/amphetamine use with age no longer holds for individuals born after 1990. Unlike North America, fentanyl‐related deaths in Australia are relatively infrequent and largely attributable to pharmaceutical fentanyl. Consistent with all drug‐related mortality in Australia, fentanyl‐related mortality predominantly occurs among older Australians, with declining rates reported among younger Australians. This trend is consistent with other trends in drug use and harms, such as the observed increasing age of initiation of injecting drug use recorded in Australia.

APC analysis has not been applied to meth/amphetamine‐related deaths in Australia, and no APC analysis of meth/amphetamine‐related deaths stratified by cause of death exists internationally. Findings from APC analyses may help public health efforts to reduce and prevent drug‐related deaths. In light of shifts in drug markets, evolving consumer practices and changing age‐specific mortality patterns, this study extends previous longitudinal trend research to provide an Australian analysis of APC effects over a 20‐year period from 2001 to 2020 by cause of death.

Aims

This study aims to (1) describe the APC patterns of Australian meth/amphetamine‐related mortality between 2001 and 2020; and (2) determine which cohorts have a high or low risk of meth/amphetamine‐related mortality relative to their age or period.

### Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate (dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate) [^114M3uTz]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of MAS-ER Capsules should be considered when treating patients with overdose. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Amphetamine and clonidine toxicity resulting in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^113eniaH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Amphetamine toxicity typically presents with hypertension and tachycardia. Conversely, clonidine acts as an agonist at central α2 and imidazoline receptors, which may cause brief initial hypertension followed by hypotension and bradycardia in overdose. We report a case of mixed ingestion resulting in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) successfully treated with phentolamine. A 17-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department 2 hours after ingesting up to 25 each of clonidine 0.1-mg tablets and dextroamphetamine 10 mg extended-release capsules. He reported nausea and fatigue with initial blood pressure (BP) 145/95 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) 52 beats per minute (bpm). Nine hours postingestion (HPI), the patient developed headache, photophobia, and confusion with BP 182/111 mm Hg and HR 48 bpm. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed generalized fullness of the cerebellum, upward bulging of the tentorial leaflets, effacement of the fourth ventricle, and crowding of the foramen magnum, suspicious for an atypical presentation of PRES. The patient's systolic BP rose over 200 mm Hg and treated with 2 mg of intravenous phentolamine at 14 HPI. Blood pressure decreased to 133/82 mm Hg, and HR increased to 56 bpm with improvements in headache. Following repeat doses of phentolamine, nicardipine was initiated and increased to 2.5 mg/h for 12 hours. The patient was stable with normal vital signs at 36 HPI. The delayed presentation of hypertensive emergency with PRES may have been due to the actions of extended-release dextroamphetamine and the α2-agonistic effects of clonidine. Phentolamine was chosen for its α1-antagonism and was effective in managing symptoms.

### Association of methamphetamine and opioid use with nonfatal overdose in rural communities [^111soPdS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Measures

Participants were asked to report whether they had ever used methamphetamine (termed as "methamphetamine, crystal meth, or amphetamine" in the survey), and if so, how many of the last 30 days they had used methamphetamine to get high. We defined current methamphetamine use as report of 1 or more days of use in the past 30 days. We defined current opioid use as at least 1 day of reported heroin, fentanyl, opioid painkillers, synthetic opioids, buprenorphine, or methadone to get high within the last 30 days. On the basis of their past-30-day use of methamphetamine and opioids, participants were categorized as using opioids without methamphetamine (opioids alone), methamphetamine without opioids (methamphetamine alone), or use of both substances.

We assessed overdose by asking participants, "Have you ever overdosed? By overdose, I mean if you passed out, turned blue, or stopped breathing from using drugs". Participants who reported any prior overdose were asked the total number of lifetime overdoses and the date of their last overdose. We used responses to construct 2 variables: (1) any overdose within the past 180 days, derived from the date of last overdose, and (2) the total number of lifetime overdoses. Because some respondents reported extremely high lifetime values, counts were truncated at the 99th percentile of the variable distribution (25 overdoses).

To assess services access, we asked, "In the past 6 months, did you try to get any of the following treatments but were unable to: buprenorphine maintenance, methadone maintenance, naltrexone shots, buprenorphine shots, outpatient drug treatment, residential or inpatient drug treatment, drug detox?" dichotomized as any unsuccessful attempt to access treatment. We also asked, "Do you currently have naloxone or Narcan with you or at home?" eTable 1 in the Supplement reports survey items used to derive measures for the current analysis.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Educate patients and their families about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction of MAS-ER Capsules, which can lead to overdose and death, and proper disposal of any unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2), Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to store MAS-ER Capsules in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give MAS-ER Capsules to anyone else.

Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death, with MAS-ER Capsule use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Advise patients that MAS-ER Capsules can cause elevations in blood pressure and heart rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Prior to initiating treatment with MAS-ER Capsules, adequately screen patients with comorbid depressive symptoms to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and/or depression. Additionally, MAS-ER Capsule therapy at usual doses may cause treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms in patients without prior history of psychotic symptoms or mania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Circulation Problems in Fingers and Toes [Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaudʼs Phenomenon]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with MAS-ER Capsules about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaudʼs phenomenon, and in associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking MAS-ER Capsules. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Evaluation of amphetamine-related hospitalizations and associated clinical outcomes and costs in the United States [^115obXKt]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Amphetamine-related hospitalizations increased between 2008 and 2015 from 55 447 to 206 180 and totaled $2.17 billion in hospital costs by 2015. These hospitalizations more than doubled in every region of the United States, but were most prevalent in the West, and increased to a greater degree than hospitalizations for other substance use disorders. Our findings suggest that amphetamine use may represent an emerging public health issue. Public health responses that address the socioeconomic factors in addiction are needed, particularly because no pharmacologic options exist for the treatment of amphetamine use disorders.

Compared with all other hospitalizations, amphetamine-related hospitalizations were associated with a 29% higher rate of adjusted in-hospital mortality. Higher in-hospital mortality may be associated with the known cardiovascular effects of amphetamine use. From the 2015 NIS data, we identified 2667 deaths during amphetamine-related hospitalizations, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 5716 deaths from psychostimulant overdose (excluding cocaine). Our study did not account for overdose deaths that occurred outside of the hospital and included deaths from possible amphetamine use complications but not overdose. Therefore, the inpatient deaths in this study partially reflect the deaths as defined and reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study provides additional information about mortality related to psychostimulant use in the United States.

### Nano-antidotes for drug overdose and poisoning [^115ahdfW]. Science Translational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The number of intoxications from xenobiotics — natural or synthetic foreign chemicals, or substances given in higher doses than typically present in humans — has risen tremendously in the last decade, placing poisoning as the leading external cause of death in the United States. This epidemic has fostered the development of antidotal nanomedicines, which we call "nano-antidotes", capable of efficiently neutralizing offending compounds in situ. Although prototype nano-antidotes have shown efficacy in proof-of-concept studies, the gap to clinical translation can only be filled if issues such as the clinical relevance of intoxication models and the safety profile of nano-antidotes are properly addressed. As the unmet medical needs in resuscitative care call for better treatments, this Perspective critically reviews the recent progress in antidotal medicine and emerging nanotechnologies.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Human experience of acute overdose with darunavir/ritonavir is limited. No specific antidote is available for overdose with darunavir. Treatment of overdose with darunavir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the active substance.

FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Manifestations of amphetamine overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with amphetamine use, including dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.

Treatment

Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up to date guidance and advice.

The prolonged release of mixed amphetamine salts from dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules should be considered when treating patients with overdose.

### Dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, and amphetamine sulfate (Mydayis) [^115NkeKw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

MYDAYIS contains mixed amphetamine salts, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

MYDAYIS has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. MYDAYIS can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

MYDAYIS may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including MYDAYIS include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

MYDAYIS may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114n1d63]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Bupropion and naltrexone — evidence scope and candidate populations: In amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use disorder, evidence for bupropion alone is described as somewhat weak, whereas two recent studies of combination bupropion and naltrexone showed more promise; both studies — one open label and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) — included patients with moderate to severe methamphetamine use disorder. The committee considered it appropriate to extend evidence to other ATS use disorder populations. For co-occurring conditions, the combination could be given additional consideration for ATS use disorder with alcohol use disorder (AUD), nicotine/tobacco use, or depressive disorders. The recommendations do not address the use of bupropion with naltrexone for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), but clinicians may consider this combination for patients with co-occurring OUD who are already prescribed naltrexone for OUD or are in OUD remission and not currently prescribed opioid agonist medication; no studies were available evaluating this combination for co-occurring methamphetamine use disorder and OUD. An important unanswered research question is whether treatment with naltrexone could be protective against opioid overdose in this population.

### A chronic condition disguised as an acute event: the case for Re-thinking stimulant overdose death [^111gFwFV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent reports indicate that stimulant-related deaths are increasing dramatically. People who die from acute stimulant toxicity have high rates of pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), much of which is undiagnosed. Moreover, people who use stimulants with CVD often remain asymptomatic until presenting to an emergency department with an acute event. Prior research shows that symptoms of stimulant toxicity may occur on a regular basis, and that people who die from stimulant toxicity are older than those who die of opioid toxicity. Taken collectively, the existing evidence suggests that death from acute stimulant toxicity is often an outcome of long-term, cumulative exposure leading to cardiovascular dysfunction rather than acute intoxication. Strategies tailored to the distinct etiology of stimulant overdose are needed. We propose a three-part approach including (1) implementing stimulant use interventions that promote not only abstinence, but also use reduction, (2) treating ongoing stimulant use as a chronic cardiovascular condition, and (3) making stimulant toxicity interventions relevant to the populations most affected, which includes people outside of the traditional health-care system. In short, to reduce stimulant-related fatality, we need to transform our approach in ways that are tailored to address its natural history.

### Stimulant overdose prediction model for medicaid-insured persons [^113FY5kb]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The US drug overdose crisis remains a substantial public health problem, with 107 543 overdose deaths occurring in 2023. Overdose deaths that involve stimulants — cocaine or amphetamines — are frequently associated with myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular events triggered by excessive sympathetic nervous system activation. In the increasingly common situation in which the overdose death involves both stimulants and opioids, death may result from the effects of the opioid alone or from the combined effects of the drugs taken. Among drug overdose deaths in 2022, approximately 26% involved cocaine and 33% involved other psychostimulants with misuse potential such as methamphetamine. Drug overdose deaths involving methamphetamines increased 5-fold from 2015 to 2022, while overdose deaths involving cocaine increased 3-fold. The rate of nonfatal stimulant-involved overdose with or without the co-involvement of opioids resulting in inpatient or emergency department (ED) treatment has also increased.

More than half of US amphetamine-related hospitalizations occur among Medicaid-insured persons. While evidence based approaches to reduce the risk of stimulant-involved overdose exist, there are currently no prediction models to aid in identifying those at highest risk across the US, although such models exist for opioid overdose. Variables that may be useful in identifying persons at high risk of stimulant-involved overdose include individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage, health services utilization indicators, and demographic variables. In addition to evidence-based messaging for the general public, those at greatest risk for stimulant-involved overdose identified by prediction models could be proactively offered evidence-based interventions. Public health practitioners could use these predictions to provide interventions such as community reinforcement or cognitive-behavioral therapy combined with contingency management — in which incentives are provided to reinforce healthy behaviors — as well as interventions that protect against the increasing risk from inadvertent or intentional intake of opioids in combination with stimulants, such as naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and guidance to avoid using alone.

This study aimed to develop and internally validate a model to predict hospitalization or ED treatment for stimulant-involved overdose during the subsequent calendar year, using both individual- and area-level characteristics. Such a model would assist public health practitioners and policymakers to identify individuals at high risk of stimulant overdose, facilitating the delivery of evidence-based interventions and knowledge of potential risk factors for overdose to these individuals.

### Amphetamine (amphetamine sulfate) [^111nzNuJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acidifying agents - Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.

Adrenergic blockers - Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.

Alkalinizing agents - Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the action of amphetamines.

Antidepressants tricyclic - Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.

Antihistamines - Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.

Antihypertensives - Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.

Chlorpromazine - Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamine, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.

### Prescription amphetamines in people with opioid use disorder and co-occurring psychostimulant use disorder initiating buprenorphine: an analysis of treatment retention and overdose risk [^112hyHLW]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Drug-related poisoning deaths involving psychostimulants have steeply increased over the past decade in the USA, and even more so when concurrently used with illicit synthetic opioids. The concurrent use of psychostimulants and opioids has been increasing over the past decade in countries like the USAand Canada, and the rise in drug-related poisoning deaths involving psychostimulants and opioids has been termed the 'fourth wave' of the opioid overdose crisis. There is an increasing presence of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogues contaminating street supplies of methamphetamine and cocaine. This puts individuals who seek psychostimulants at a risk of drug-related poisoning when using an adulterated substance, as they may have no prior exposure or tolerance to opioids. A recent study shows that methamphetamine poisoning deaths, with and without concurrent involvement of opioids, have increased steeply over the last decade in the USA. Moreover, simultaneous psychostimulant use disorder (PSUD, including cocaine use disorder (CUD) and methamphetamine use disorder (MUD)) and opioid use disorder (OUD) have become more prevalent over the same period in North Americaand Australia.

Non-prescribed psychostimulants and opioids pose higher risk of drug-related poisoning deaths when used together as compared with each drug aloneand a recent study has found that using psychostimulants and opioid concurrently poses twice the risk of a fatal overdose compared with using opioids alone. The opioid partial agonist buprenorphine is the most common maintenance medication used in treatment of OUD. Patients in treatment for OUD may need prescription stimulant medications for the treatment of attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as recent evidence has demonstrated that treating ADHD among patients with OUD may improve retention in treatment and reduce illicit substance use. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis shows that prescription amphetamines (PAs) in particular, are a potentially useful tool to treat PSUD, especially CUD, as it is able to promote abstinence and reduce drug use. Examples of benefits of PA use for individuals with PSUD include increased treatment retentionand reduction in all-cause mortality. This represents a challenge for clinicians who should carefully weigh potential risks and benefits of prescription stimulants when treating patients with OUD and/or PSUD.

### Antipsychotics for the treatment of sympathomimetic toxicity: a systematic review [^115xV5kB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Benzodiazepines are often recommended first-line for management of cocaine and amphetamine toxicity while antipsychotic treatment is discouraged due to the potential for lowering seizure threshold, prolonging the QT interval, and decreasing heat dissipation. We performed a systematic review including animal and human studies to elucidate the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in managing sympathomimetic toxicity specifically evaluating the effect of treatment on mortality, seizures, hyperthermia, and cardiovascular effects.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL and gray literature from inception to 31 May 2017 to answer: Can antipsychotics be used safely and effectively to treat cocaine or amphetamine toxicity? Citations were screened by title and abstract. Additional citations were identified with citation tracking. Data were extracted from full-texts.

Results

6539 citations were identified; 250 full-text articles were assessed. Citation tracking identified 2336 citations; 155 full texts were reviewed. Seventy-three papers were included in this review. In 96 subjects with cocaine toxicity treated with an antipsychotic, there were three deaths, two cardiac arrests, two seizures, and one episode of hyperthermia. In 330 subjects with amphetamine toxicity treated with an antipsychotic, there were two episodes of coma and QT prolongation and one episode of each: hypotension, NMS, cardiac arrest, and death.

Conclusion

This systematic review represents an exhaustive compilation of the available evidence. There is neither a clear benefit of antipsychotics over benzodiazepines nor a definitive signal of harm noted. We encourage clinicians to adapt treatment based on specific circumstances and characteristics of their individual patients.

### A retrospective review of supratherapeutic modafinil exposures [^112MBSXF]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Modafinil (2-[(Diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide) is a unique non-amphetamine wakefulness-promoting agent that was first marketed in France in the early 1990s for the treatment of excessive somnolence in patients with narcolepsy. It was subsequently approved in the USA in 1998 under the brand name Provigil® and is used for the treatment of various sleep disorders characterized by excessive sleepiness, including narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It has steadily gained popularity among prescribers due to its wakefulness-promoting efficacy, presumed lower potential for abuse, and lack of peripheral sympathomimetic effects commonly observed with amphetamine stimulants. As a result, it has been studied and used off-label to treat sedation and fatigue in neurological and medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, HIV infection, cancer, and fibromyalgia. It has also shown promise in the treatment of cocaine dependence and withdrawal, alcoholic organic brain disorder, and in augmentation of antidepressant regimens.

Modafinil appears to have a complex mechanism of action that is not completely understood. It is known to cause an increase in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, and histamine and to cause a decrease in extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid in the neocortex. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter at clinically relevant doses, which may be responsible in part for its therapeutic effects. Unlike amphetamines, modafinil has no effect on spontaneous dopamine release or turnover and lacks peripheral sympathomimetic effects.

Little information on supratherapeutic dosing of modafinil exists in the current medical literature. Two small case series have been published in abstract form, and a recent review of data from 11 states was published by Spiller et al. During clinical trials, intentional acute overdoses as high as 4,500 mg were reported, with insomnia, tachycardia, agitation, and anxiety being the only side effects reported; no life-threatening toxicity occurred, and to date, no fatal overdoses have occurred involving modafinil alone.

We performed a retrospective chart review of modafinil exposures reported to the California Poison Control System over an 11-year period. Our aim in this study was to characterize the clinical effects and toxicity associated with overdose of modafinil in the hope of improving treatment guidelines and recommendations for patients with modafinil ingestion.

### Oral clonazepam versus lorazepam in the treatment of methamphetamine-poisoned children: a pilot clinical trial [^114g5Kzi]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, Iran has seen a rise in the prevalence of stimulant abuse, including from methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and ecstasy. The hidden nature of stimulant abuse among family members has also resulted in a dramatic increase in the frequency of accidental stimulant toxicity in children. Even though accidental opioid poisonings remain more common in Iranian children, this change in adult drug use patterns presents a challenge for clinical practice, since no appropriate antidote exists for stimulant poisoning. The most common signs and symptoms of stimulant toxicity in children are irritability, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, seizure, inconsolable or constant body movements, roving eye movements, cortical blindness, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, vomiting, respiratory distress, and rhabdomyolysis.

Benzodiazepines (BZOs) are the first-line medications in the treatment of toxicity from stimulants, including methamphetamine. Management of agitation is the cornerstone in the treatment of methamphetamine poisoning, which can prevent further complications including hyperthermia, hypertension, hallucination, delirium, and rhabdomyolysis.

BZO treatment can control methamphetamine-induced agitation and prevent seizures simultaneously. The binding of BZOs to the GABA receptor increases chloride permeability causing an influx of chloride ions intracellularly and result in anti-anxiety, anti-convulsive, and sedative effects. They are generally intravenously administered until the patient becomes symptom-free and calm.

However, in pediatric patients, access to and maintenance of the intravenous (IV) line is a major concern, especially in younger children and in busy wards. A child may not cooperate with the treating team, and the IV line may be lost during the treatment process due to the child's movements. IV administration of BZOs in children needs to be slow and requires respiratory monitoring, as rapid administration of BZOs may induce respiratory depression and apnea. This risk is not common with oral BZOs.

### Bupropion overdose presenting as status epilepticus in an infant [^113BM4Mz]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bupropion is a monocyclic antidepressant in the aminoketone class, structurally related to amphetamines. The Food and Drug Administration withdrew this product from the market in 1986 after seizures were reported in bulimic patients. It was later reintroduced in 1989 when the incidence of seizures was shown to be dose-related in the immediate release preparation. Massive bupropion ingestion has been associated with status epilepticus and cardiogenic shock in adults. Seizures have been reported in children, but not status epilepticus. This report highlights a patient who presented with status epilepticus and developed cardiopulmonary arrest after bupropion ingestion. False-positive amphetamine diagnosis from urine drug screen on presentation was reported.

Method

We review the presentation, clinical course, diagnostic studies, and outcome of this patient. We then review the literature regarding bupropion overdose in children.

Result

Symptoms of bupropion toxicity and risk for seizures are dose-dependent and fatalities have been reported. Our patient developed status epilepticus and cardiopulmonary arrest and then progressed to have a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and refractory symptomatic partial seizures.

Conclusion

Our report highlights the need to keep this medication away from children in order to prevent accidental overdose.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^112QGmLm]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Toxicology emergencies — opioid overdose background notes that opioid overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, with more than 80 000 people in the United States dying of opioid overdose in 2021 and a 14% increase in the age-adjusted death rate from opioid overdose in a single year; in the same year, 1.06 million people were treated in US EDs for nonfatal opioid overdose. Most overdoses are unintentional. Opioid overdose causes central nervous system depression (sleepiness, unresponsiveness) and respiratory depression (slowed and stopped breathing), which, if untreated, progresses to cardiac arrest. Naloxone is an antidote that reverses the effect of opioid overdose, restoring consciousness and breathing; it can be administered by multiple routes, and naloxone nasal spray is available in the United States without a prescription. Because it can be difficult to reliably ascertain the presence or absence of a pulse in the first aid setting, these guidelines follow the Opioid-Associated Emergency for Lay Responders Algorithm (Figure 6).

### Liquid ecstasy intoxication: clinical features of 505 consecutive emergency department patients [^113yMWbs]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To describe the epidemiological profile and clinical manifestations of liquid ecstasy (GHB) poisonings.

Methods

All cases of GHB poisoning or overdose admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of the Hospital Clinic (Barcelona) between 2000 and 2007 were recorded.

Results

A total of 505 patients (mean age 24.7 years, 68% men) were included. Most patients were brought to the hospital by ambulance (98%), during the weekend (89%) and during the early morning (75%). Symptoms began in a public place in 97%. Reduced consciousness was the most important clinical manifestation: 72% of patients had a Glasgow Coma Score of ≤ 12. 76% of patients had consumed other drugs: ethanol (64%), amphetamines and derivates (30%), cocaine (28%), ketamine (11%), cannabis (9%) and others (5%). Treatment was required in 26% of cases and an antidote was administered in 35 cases with no response. There were no deaths. The combined GHB group had a longer time to complete recovery of consciousness (71 ± 40 vs 59 ± 40 min, p < 0.001) and a higher percentage of patients with severely reduced consciousness at ED arrival (54% vs 37%, p = 0.01), need for treatment (29% vs 16%, p < 0.01) and need for mechanical ventilation (3% vs 0%, p < 0.05) compared with the pure GHB group.

Conclusions

GHB intoxication leading to reduced consciousness is a frequent reason for ED admission, above all in young people and in the early morning at the weekend. Symptoms are more severe in patients who have taken GHB in combination with other substances of abuse.

### Nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in emergency departments-29 States, 2018–2019 [^112VxJvd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Among U.S. Census regions, relative and absolute increases in rates of opioid-involved overdoses were observed in the South (16.5%; 19.2), West (11.5%; 13.5), and Midwest (8.3%; 11.8); of amphetamine-involved overdoses in the Northeast (18.9%; 0.6), South (14.3%; 1.1), and West (21.2%; 3.2); and of cocaine-involved overdoses in the South (12.0%; 1.0) and Midwest (14.9%; 0.7). The Midwest experienced the only decline in relative and absolute rate for benzodiazepine-involved overdoses (−11.2%; −1.5). Relative and absolute rates of opioid-involved overdoses increased among persons living in both urban (13.6%; 16.9) and rural counties (10.1%; 6.1), as did rates of amphetamine-involved overdoses (21.7%; 1.3, urban and 20.8%; 1.9, rural).

Changes in rates of polydrug overdoses predominantly comprised those co-involving opioids and amphetamines (37.3% relative increase; 0.4 per 100,000 absolute increase) (Table 2). Relative and absolute rate increases for overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines were experienced by both females (32.7%; 0.2) and males (38.3%; 0.6) and all age groups except persons aged 45–54 years. Relative and absolute rate increases were identified in the Northeast (116.3%; 0.4), South (33.3%; 0.4), and West (26.7%; 0.7) Census regions. Relative and absolute increases in rates of overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines occurred among persons living in urban counties (54.1%; 0.5).

5.8	Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Discontinue treatment with Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.

5.9	Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors

Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Overdosage (10)].

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

### Amphetamine sulfate tablets (amphetamine sulfate) [^1124cJWT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Acidifying agents - Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.

Adrenergic blockers - Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.

Alkalinizing agents - Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the nonionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the action of amphetamines.

Antidepressants tricyclic - Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d- amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.

Antihistamines - Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.

Antihypertensives - Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.

Chlorpromazine - Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamine, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.

### Methylphenidate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^116KPHgp]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 8,000 ingestions of methylphenidate. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected ingestions of methylphenidate by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to methylphenidate, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of methylphenidate ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose of methylphenidate and the effects of an overdose and is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) In patients without evidence of self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent, poison center personnel should elicit additional information including the time of the ingestion, the precise dose ingested, and the presence of coingestants (Grade D). 3) Patients who are chronically taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and who have ingested any amount of methylphenidate require referral to an emergency department (Grade D). 4) Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild stimulation or agitation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include moderate-to-severe agitation, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, headache, chest pain, loss of consciousness, or convulsions (Grade D). 5) For patients referred to an emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on several factors including the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take for the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 6) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 3 hours have elapsed between the time of ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 7) Patients with acute or acute-on-chronic ingestions of less than a toxic dose (see recommendations 8, 9, and 10) or chronic exposures to methylphenidate with no or mild symptoms can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. For acute-on-chronic ingestions, the caller should be instructed not to administer methylphenidate to the patient for the next 24 hours. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 3 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 8) Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less, of an immediate-release formulation (or the equivalent amount of a modified-release formulation that has been chewed) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 9) If a patch has been swallowed, consider the entire contents of the patch (not just the labeled dose of the patch) to have been ingested. Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less should be referred to an emergency department. If it is known that the patch has been chewed only briefly, and the patch remains intact, significant toxicity is unlikely and emergency department referral is not necessary (Grade D). 10) Patients who ingest more than 4 mg/kg or 120 mg, whichever is less, of an intact modified-release formulation should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 11) For oral exposures, do not induce emesis (Grade D). 12) Pre-hospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activate charcoal (Grade D). 13) Benzodiazepines can be administered by EMS personnel if agitation, dystonia, or convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C). 14) Standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) measures should be administered by EMS personnel if respiratory arrest, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac arrest are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C).

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

MAS-ER Capsules contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

MAS-ER Capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. MAS-ER Capsules can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including MAS-ER Capsules, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

MAS-ER Capsules may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including MAS-ER Capsules include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

MAS-ER Capsules may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

2.1 Important Information Prior to Initiating Treatment

Prior to initiating treatment with dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (e.g., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs for abuse and overdose, and periodically re-evaluate the need for dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

### The INTOXICATE study: methodology and preliminary results of a prospective observational study [^1172ozHJ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients

The patient inclusion criteria were adult patients (aged 18 years or older); patients admitted to the ICU from an emergency department, ambulance, or ward; intoxication (due to poisoning) as the main reason for ICU admission; and patients who stayed in the ICU for four hours or more. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years; admitted to the ICU because of another serious comorbidity (e.g. trauma from a car accident while intoxicated as the management, outcome and duration of admission were likely to be dictated by the comorbidity rather than the intoxication); and an ICU stay of less than four hours. Toxicity was defined as the occurrence of any toxic effect to humans following a single or repeated exposure to a mixture of natural or synthetic substances available on the market or present in the environment. Pure ethanol intoxication was covered by the exposure definition. Informed consent of the participating patients was either required or not, depending on the country and/or the unit.

Variables

The primary outcome, 'eventful ICU admission', was a composite outcome defined as the rate of patients who received any of the following treatments in the first 24 h after the ICU admission: oxygen supplementation with a FiO2 > 40%, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy (RRT), cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antidotes, active cooling, fluid resuscitation (> 1.5 L of intravenous fluid of any kind), sedation, or who died in the hospital.

Exposure variables were the exposure exact name, category, dose, and route. Human medications were categorized according to the underlying pharmacological group based on: alcohol (ethanol, other alcohols); analgesics; antidepressants (cyclic antidepressants, lithium); street drugs (opiates, cocaine, amphetamine); sedatives (hypnotics, antipsychotic, benzodiazepines); 'other poisons' (carbon monoxide, arsenic, cyanides); other toxins; and mixed intoxications (combination of two or more sub-types of intoxication).

Data were collected on potential predictors (type of units, unit size, country, patient's age, sex, comorbidities, possible second reason for ICU admission, vital signs, investigations (including ECG).

Toxicology testing recommendations — in patients presenting with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal, clinicians can use toxicology testing to inform clinical thinking regarding the differential diagnosis, along with other clinical information (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation), and to identify substance use that could produce drug–drug interactions when considering pharmacotherapy to manage signs and symptoms of stimulant intoxication or withdrawal (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should consider the possibility of novel psychoactive stimulants if stimulant intoxication is suspected but presumptive testing is negative (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Severe poisoning after self-reported use of 2-(4-iodo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl) methyl] ethanamine, a novel substituted amphetamine: a case series [^116vnts1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Significant toxicity from amphetamine and cathinone derivatives is being increasingly reported. We describe a series of self-reported exposures to 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine (25-I-NBOME or 25-I), a novel amphetamine derivative. Ten patients with an average age of 17 years presented to local emergency departments (EDs) in our community after ingestion and/or insufflation of a drug referred to as "25-I". Of 10 patients, 6 reported taking 25-I alone; other substances included ethanol; 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine; marijuana; and ketamine. Most common effects included tachycardia (90%), hypertension (70%), agitation (60%), and hallucinations (50%). The average heart rate was 123 beats per minute. Two patients were found in status epilepticus, and another was found unresponsive. One patient who had a seizure had multiple, discrete intraparenchymal hemorrhages and acute kidney injury. Six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, two were treated in the ED and released, and 1 each was admitted to psychiatry or managed in a clinical decision unit and subsequently discharged. Three patients required emergent intubation, and all admitted patients (7/10) were given intravenous benzodiazepines for sedation. Urine and blood specimens were obtained from 1 patient, which showed analytic confirmation of 25-I. In addition to sympathomimetic effects, methoxy and other substituent groups impart serotonergic effects, resulting in hallucinogenic properties. 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine appears to be extremely potent with a reported "dose" of 500 μg resulting in increased potential for inadvertent overdose. This case series describes significant morbidity in a local cluster of young patients after self-reported use of 25-I, a newly identified drug of abuse.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules should be considered when treating patients with overdose. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

Modafinil is a non-amphetamine wakefulness-promoting agent used for the treatment of various sleep disorders characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. There is little information in the medical literature with respect to supratherapeutic doses of this medication. We performed a retrospective review of the California Poison Control System database for all cases of single-substance ingestion of modafinil with follow-up to a known outcome for the time period 1998–2008. Data collected included age, gender, dose ingested, clinical effects, and medical outcome. There were a total of 87 patients, 53 (61%) of which were female. Patient ages ranged from 1.25 to 72 years with a mean of 30 years; 17 (20%) patients were aged 6 years or less. Thirty-three (38%) were intentional overdoses. Most commonly reported effects were tachycardia (n = 23), agitation (n = 14), anxiety (n = 11), headache (n = 8), hypertension (n = 6), dystonia/tremor (n = 6), and dizziness (n = 5). Forty-nine patients (56%) were managed at home, and 38 (44%) were managed in a healthcare setting. Therapies administered included activated charcoal (n = 8), benzodiazepines (n = 7), antihistamines (n = 2), intravenous fluids (n = 2), haloperidol (n = 2), and beta-blockers (n = 1). Effects were classified as none (n = 22), minor (n = 54), and moderate (n = 11). No major effects and no deaths occurred. Effects of modafinil overdose appear to be mild in most cases, with tachycardia and CNS symptoms predominating. Clinically significant effects requiring treatment occurred in a small number of patients.

Modafinil is a non-amphetamine stimulant that is prescribed for narcolepsy-associated sleepiness as well as reported off-licence uses among university students looking to improve wakefulness and focus. There is limited information in the medical literature about supratherapeutic modafinil dosage, symptomatology and management of overdose. We report a case of a healthy 32-year-old man who was found unconscious, having vomited, with an empty modafinil blister strip. At the emergency department, he presented with reduced Glasgow Coma Scale and prolonged episodes of vomiting. This acute presentation was conservatively managed in the intensive care unit. Antibiotics were also given for a suspected aspiration pneumonia. CT of the head showed cerebral oedema and biochemistry investigations revealed hyponatraemia. Result aetiology was unclear, however, it has been theorised to be secondary to a sizeable modafinil overdose.

INTRODUCTION

Methamphetamine is a potent amphetamine‐type stimulant (ATS) that increases dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic activity within the brain resulting in euphoria, arousal, and disinhibition, among other effects. During World War II, ATS were used by soldiers to increase wakefulness and suppress appetite. Over the following decades, ATS were widely prescribed for fatigue, emotional distress, and obesity. In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act, which laid the initial framework for the categorization and regulation of controlled substances, began curtailing medical prescribing of ATS, opening a market for illicitly manufactured methamphetamine. For the remainder of the twentieth century, the production and distribution of illicit methamphetamine (also known as "meth", "crank", "speed", "crystal", or "ice") centered on the Western United States. In the twenty‐first century, methamphetamine use has increased dramatically and spread throughout North America. Methamphetamine‐related overdose deaths have risen sharply during this time, disproportionately affecting American Indian and Alaska Native populations and Black men.

The most common route of methamphetamine use is smoking, followed by injection and snorting. However, methamphetamine use via injection is increasing and is associated with higher rates of overdose and infectious complications. Individuals with co‐use of methamphetamine and opioids face increased acute care utilization, infectious complications, and risk of overdose, with lower engagement in treatment compared to those who only use opioids.

Methamphetamine use and methamphetamine use disorder (MaUD) may lead to acute and chronic neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, infectious, and traumatic complications. Acute care utilization related to methamphetamine increased four‐ to sixfold during the past decade, resulting in at least $2 billion in costs. Among hospitalized patients, methamphetamine use is associated with longer lengths of stay, increased in‐hospital mortality, and decreased linkage to postdischarge care. Hospitalists will increasingly need to diagnose and manage sequelae of methamphetamine use.

We obtained relevant society guidelines and searched the PubMed database using three Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term queries: "methamphetamine/toxicity, " "methamphetamine AND hospitalization, " and "methamphetamine AND substance withdrawal syndrome", which yielded a total of 299 English language articles published between 2019 and 2024. We reviewed the search results and guidelines for applicable recommendations on managing sequelae of methamphetamine use in hospitalized patients including acute intoxication, withdrawal, MaUD, and chronic complications (Table 1).

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Effects of Overdose

Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects:

Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop.
CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur.
Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104°F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop.

Overdose Management

Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. The pharmacokinetic profile of DYANAVEL XR should be considered when treating patients with overdose. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine suflate [^111tkzbs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncrasy at low doses.

Symptoms

Manifestations of acute overdosage with amphetamines include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia and rhabdomyolysis.

Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation.

Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension and circulatory collapse.

Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.

Treatment

Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up to date guidance and advice. Management of acute amphetamine intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, administration of a cathartic and sedation. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed to increase risk of acute renal failure if myoglobinuria is present. If acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine has been suggested. However, a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulant effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication.

### 4-methyl-amphetamine: a health threat for recreational amphetamine users [^115zMBbB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

4-Methylamphetamine (4-MA) was originally developed as an appetite suppressant, but development was halted due to side effects. It has recently resurfaced as a new psychoactive substance in Europe, and is mostly found together with amphetamine. Around 11.5% of tested Dutch speed samples were positive for 4-MA. In Belgium, 4-MA was also found in speed samples. In 2011 and 2012, several fatal incidents after amphetamine use were observed in Belgium, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. In all victims, toxicological analysis confirmed the presence of 4-MA, in addition to amphetamine. The observed blood amphetamine levels were too low to be fatal. Contrary to amphetamine, which displays noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity, 4-MA also shows serotonergic activity, which may contribute to the observed toxicity. Other mechanisms of toxicity are put forward in this paper as well. To conclude, the observed toxicity is most likely the result of the combined dopaminergic activity of amphetamine and the serotonergic activity of 4-MA. In addition, the presence of 4-MA may have dampened the psychoactive effects of amphetamine by attenuation of the amphetamine-induced dopamine release, potentially inclining users to ingest higher doses of contaminated speed. Also, slower metabolism of 4-MA and its MAO-inhibiting properties can also contribute to the unusual high toxicity of 4-MA.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^111agWSG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

United States overdose epidemiology involving stimulants — between 2012 and 2021, the rate of overdose deaths involving cocaine more than tripled from 1.4 per 100 000 in 2012 to 7.3 in 2021, increasing on average by 21% per year. Over the same period, deaths involving methamphetamine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants increased more than 12-fold from 0.8 per 100 000 in 2012 to 10.0 in 2021. The precipitous increase in novel and designer drugs in the market complicates the clinical picture, and while the rate of cocaine use has been relatively flat, rates of cocaine use disorder, methamphetamine use, and methamphetamine use disorder are rising. In 2021, 50% of all overdose deaths in the US involved stimulants, 23% involved cocaine, and 30% involved psychostimulants (primarily methamphetamine). There has been a large increase in the risk from use due to the increasing potency of illicit stimulants and the increasing use of stimulants in combination with opioids, which can increase toxicity, a growing number of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are using stimulants intentionally, and others may be unaware that the stimulants they use are contaminated with fentanyl or other opioids.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and
Addiction

Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules to anyone else. Throughout Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

5.2	Risks to Patients with
Serious Cardiac Disease

Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage.

Avoid Mixed Salts of a Single-Entity Amphetamine Product Extended-Release Capsules use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

5.3
Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in emergency departments-29 States, 2018–2019 [^114QhJaq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

From 2018 to 2019, rates of suspected nonfatal overdoses involving opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines treated in EDs increased, and those involving benzodiazepines decreased. Despite the decline in nonfatal benzodiazepine-involved overdoses, benzodiazepines were identified in 12.2% of nonfatal overdoses treated in EDs during 2017. Benzodiazepines were also one of the most common drug classes identified in overdose deaths, likely because of co-use with opioids. Increases in overdose rates involving other drugs highlight the complicated nature of and challenges associated with addressing the evolving U.S. drug overdose epidemic. Deaths involving synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl, have been increasing since 2013. In addition, the availability of cocaine and methamphetamine has increased in the United States in recent years, and according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, methamphetamine was the most frequently reported drug among all drug submissions in 2019.

Consistent with prior research, opioids constituted a large percentage of drug overdoses overall and were substantially co-involved with stimulant overdoses. Notably, rates of suspected overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines significantly increased from 2018 to 2019, overall, and in both sexes and nearly all age groups. Findings are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted increases in methamphetamine use initiation, ††††† co-use between stimulants and opioids, nonfatal stimulant-involved overdoses treated in EDs, and co-involvement of opioids and stimulants in overdose deaths.

These findings have important programmatic implications regarding the evolving U.S. overdose epidemic. Syndromic surveillance is a critical data source for identifying overdose spikes and clusters to inform deployment of public health and public safety resources. Expanding coverage to include all ED visits in the United States would help further identify certain population characteristics and geographic regions that should be prioritized for prevention, treatment, and response efforts. The increases observed in polydrug overdose rates highlight the complexity of the overdose epidemic and the need to intervene more rapidly before nonfatal polydrug overdoses increase further or result in fatal overdoses.

### Amphetamine (adzenys XR-ODT) [^116mrEar]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to ADZENYS XR-ODT. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of ADZENYS XR-ODT with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Discontinue treatment with ADZENYS XR-ODT and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of ADZENYS XR-ODT with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate ADZENYS XR-ODT with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.

5.8 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome

CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette's syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Before initiating ADZENYS XR-ODT, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Regularly monitor ADZENYS XR-ODT-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.

Background framing notes that per capita prescription drug spending accounts for 17% of healthcare costs and that there have been unprecedented and profound increases in the costs of antidotes and other prescription drugs in the U.S. The largest driver cited is market exclusivity, defined as restrictive marketing rights granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) independent of a drug's patent; exclusivity can be extended for reasons such as pediatric studies by the sponsor or development of orphan indications, and this allows recovery of research and development costs that were estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2014. In the U.S., brand name drugs comprise approximately 10% of approved pharmaceutical products but account for 72% of pharmaceutical spending, with brand name drug prices increasing 164% overall from 2008 to 2015 while wages increased approximately 8%. Additional U.S. system features contributing to higher prices include the more rapid acceptance of new products, especially in small market share medications, and greater difficulty for payers to negotiate price with more stringent coverage requirements.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112JWFg2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Stimulant poisoning/overdose — aliases, patient care goals, and presentation criteria are outlined. Aliases include Amphetamines, Bath Salts, Cocaine, Ice, Methamphetamine, Phencyclidine (PCP), and Stimulant. Patient care goals are to identify intoxicating agent, protect organs at risk for injury, determine if there is an antidote, and treat the symptoms, which may include severe tachycardia and hypertension, agitation, hallucinations, chest pain, seizure, and arrhythmia. Inclusion criteria list tachycardia/tachydysrhythmias, hypertension, diaphoresis, delusions/paranoia, seizures, hyperthermia, mydriasis (dilated pupils), and exposure to stimulant/hallucinogenic agents including cocaine, amphetamine/methamphetamine, phencyclidine (PCP) (hallucinogen), bupropion, synthetic stimulant drugs of abuse (some having mixed properties), ecstasy, methamphetamine, khat or synthetic cathinones ("bath salts"), "Spice", "K2", and synthetic THC. Exclusion criteria: None noted.

### Comparison of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine exposures reported to U.S. poison centers [^115qHjA5]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug stimulant that requires the enzymatic hydrolysis of lysine from dexamphetamine for pharmacologic effects. There is limited information comparing non-therapeutic lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine exposures.

Objective

The objective was to compare lisdexamfetamine exposures with dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release.

Methods

A retrospective observational case series of single-substance exposures to lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, or dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release reported to the National Poison Data System from 2007 to 2012 was performed. Data were analyzed for demographics, reason, clinical effects, management site, and outcomes.

Results

There were 23,553 exposures: lisdexamfetamine (7,113), dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release (6,245), and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release (10,195). The most frequent clinical effects observed for lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release were agitation (19.8%, 21.7%, and 25.1%, respectively) and tachycardia (19.2%, 22.8%, and 23.9%, respectively). The reason was most often exploratory (93.4%) in children < 6 years and therapeutic error (65.6%) in children aged 6–12 years. In adolescents and adults most common reasons were suicide attempts (28.4%) followed by abuse (19.5%) and therapeutic errors (18.8%). Overall, 61.6% of cases were managed in a health care facility, with the majority treated in the emergency department only. The majority of cases (76.0%) experienced no or minor effects. More serious outcomes (moderate/major/death) occurred in 21.2% of lisdexamfetamine, 24.7% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, and 25.5% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. There were 4 deaths (1 dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and 3 dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release). In patients aged 6 years and more, abuse/misuse was more frequently reported for dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release (32.5%) and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release (23.0%) than that for lisdexamfetamine (13.5%). The odds of abuse/misuse was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0–2.4) times higher for dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release than that for lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release combined; the odds of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release abuse/misuse was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7–2.2) times higher than lisdexamfetamine. In 2011, the number of lisdexamfetamine abuse/misuse cases exceeded dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release by approximately 26% and plateaued in 2012, but was significantly lower (∼75%) than dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release.

Conclusions

Toxic effects were similar for all three drugs. Although the majority of cases were treated at health care facilities, the majority of patients experienced no effects or minor toxicity. Serious outcomes occurred in approximately 21% of lisdexamfetamine and 25% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. Lisdexamfetamine may have less abuse potential, especially compared with the immediate-release dextroamphetamine/amphetamine formulation.
