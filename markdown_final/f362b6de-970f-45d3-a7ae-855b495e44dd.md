## Question

deflazacort

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about deflazacort for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, including indication, mechanism, dosing, efficacy, safety, special populations, and practical prescribing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and age range. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics. Next, I will review the pivotal efficacy data and dose selection. After that, I need to examine safety, boxed warnings, and monitoring. I will then consider special populations, drug interactions, and administration details. Finally, I will synthesize comparative data versus prednisone/prednisolone and outline a practical prescribing approach with counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the indication and labeled age range. Deflazacort is FDA-approved for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and the Emflaza brand is indicated for patients 2 years and older, whereas generic tablets and other brands are indicated for patients 5 years and older, reflecting marketing exclusivity differences rather than a true safety divergence in this context, so I should be precise about the product-specific labeling when counseling families [^1162TU34] [^111WA9Mi] [^112udwSF] [^115n1zjC].

> I need to check the mechanism and pharmacokinetics to anchor dosing and interactions. Deflazacort is a corticosteroid prodrug rapidly converted to 21-desDFZ, which acts via glucocorticoid receptor–mediated anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects; the exact mechanism in DMD is not fully defined, but clinically it reduces inflammation and slows muscle degeneration, which aligns with observed functional benefits [^113E8fdr] [^112XMn9N]. Absorption is rapid with a median Tmax around 1 hour, and while a high-fat meal lowers Cmax and delays Tmax, AUC is unchanged, so administration with food is acceptable; protein binding of the active metabolite is about 40%, and elimination is predominantly urinary with most of the dose cleared by 24 hours, which supports once-daily dosing and informs drug–drug interaction management [^113E8fdr] [^112XMn9N].

> Next, I should review the pivotal efficacy data and confirm the recommended dose. In the phase 3 randomized trial, deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day significantly improved average muscle strength at 12 weeks versus placebo and showed persistence of benefit at 52 weeks; the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose offered only a small additional short-term benefit with more adverse effects, so the FDA recommends 0.9 mg/kg/day as the target dose and advises against 1.2 mg/kg/day for routine use [^115nCra5] [^111gZCZJ]. Wait, let me verify the functional endpoints; yes, timed function tests such as rise from supine, stair climb, and 30-foot walk/run also favored deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day at 12 weeks, reinforcing the clinical relevance of strength gains [^111gZCZJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term outcomes; I should double-check comparative and real-world data. Post hoc analyses and meta-analyses of placebo arms from modern trials suggest deflazacort is associated with slower functional decline than prednisone/prednisolone over 48 weeks, including smaller losses in 6-minute walk distance and better performance on timed function tests, although these are nonrandomized comparisons and should be interpreted cautiously despite adjustment attempts [^113FQL1V] [^111yD8vJ]. Observational cohort data also associate deflazacort with delayed loss of ambulation versus prednisone/prednisolone, but confounding by indication and care standards remains possible, so I need to communicate this as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^115jG27k].

> I will now examine safety and boxed warnings to ensure risk mitigation is explicit. Very common adverse effects include Cushingoid features, hirsutism, weight gain, and increased appetite; common effects include behavioral changes, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms, while serious risks include adrenal suppression, hyperglycemia, cataracts, osteoporosis, infections, and neuropsychiatric effects, so families should be counseled proactively and monitored regularly [^112p3gdW] [^1161giJ9] [^1122Tux4]. I should confirm boxed warnings: exacerbation of psychosis, left ventricular rupture risk after recent MI, and HBV reactivation are highlighted, which necessitates careful screening and vigilance in at-risk patients [^116znLK7].

> Let me consider endocrine and growth effects carefully, because these often drive regimen choice. Deflazacort is associated with less weight gain than prednisone in several analyses, but it may have a greater impact on linear growth, with higher frequencies of growth delay and cataracts reported in some cohorts; this trade-off should be individualized, and growth should be tracked longitudinally with shared decision-making about steroid choice and dose minimization strategies when feasible [^113yxeGy] [^115jG27k]. I should confirm adrenal suppression risk and tapering needs; abrupt withdrawal can precipitate adrenal insufficiency, so dose reductions should be gradual, especially after prolonged therapy, and stress dosing may be needed during intercurrent illness or surgery [^115mhRek].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug interactions to avoid preventable harm. In hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is recommended for Child-Pugh A or B, and there is no available guidance for Child-Pugh C, so I should monitor closely and consider alternatives if liver dysfunction is severe; in renal impairment, including dialysis and CRRT, no dose adjustment is required, though clinical monitoring remains essential [^111ZiqGa] [^117WDqGQ] [^114WsXfE] [^113pEj6p] [^112jV97a] [^114bE5Cs] [^113Ux7A7]. For pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh risks given evidence of fetal harm and the need to monitor neonates for hypoadrenalism; in pediatrics, the labeled age varies by product, so I must align with the specific brand's indication when prescribing [^1136sPqn] [^1162TU34] [^112udwSF].

> I need to ensure I cover drug interactions and administration details that change practice. Moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, and grapefruit juice increase exposure to the active metabolite about threefold, so the dose should be reduced to one third when coadministered; conversely, strong CYP3A4 inducers like rifampin should be avoided because they markedly reduce exposure and efficacy [^113Msdi1]. Administration can be with or without food, but grapefruit juice should be avoided; the oral suspension must be shaken well, dosed with the provided dispenser, and any unused suspension discarded one month after opening to ensure stability and safety [^114GBh8J].

> But wait, what if a family asks how deflazacort compares with prednisone or prednisolone; I should lay out the comparative evidence transparently. Randomized data show both daily deflazacort and daily prednisone improve strength and function versus placebo and that daily regimens outperform intermittent prednisone over three years, with no significant difference between the two daily corticosteroids in the FOR-DMD trial's composite outcome, although behavioral and growth profiles differ subtly across regimens [^114VSqZW]. Observational and post hoc analyses repeatedly suggest less functional decline with deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone, but these are not randomized comparisons and may reflect residual confounding, so I should present them as supportive but not definitive [^113FQL1V] [^111yD8vJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical prescribing approach and double-check that it aligns with evidence and labeling. Initiate deflazacort at 0.9 mg/kg/day orally, once daily, ideally in the morning to mitigate sleep disruption, and reassess efficacy and tolerability at 3 to 6 months; avoid 1.2 mg/kg/day routinely due to more adverse effects without durable added benefit, and consider dose reductions only for significant toxicity rather than for convenience [^111gZCZJ]. I should confirm baseline and periodic monitoring plans: height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, glucose, vision screening for cataracts, bone health assessment, and infection surveillance; counsel on infection risk, gradual tapering if discontinuation is needed, and stress-dose steroids for illness or surgery to prevent adrenal crisis [^115mhRek] [^117V4GDe].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient and caregiver counseling is concrete. Advise avoiding grapefruit juice, shaking the suspension and using the dispenser correctly, and discarding opened suspension after one month; reinforce that abrupt stops are dangerous and that fever or infection warrants prompt medical contact; discuss expected benefits such as improved strength and possible delays in functional decline, balanced against risks like weight gain, growth effects, cataracts, and behavioral changes, so decisions remain aligned with family goals and evolving evidence [^114GBh8J] [^115mhRek] [^112X3e7G].

Deflazacort is a corticosteroid prodrug approved for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients aged ≥ 2 years [^1162TU34], with a recommended dose of **0.9 mg/kg/day** [^notfound]. It improves muscle strength and delays loss of ambulation [^112Z3EXA] [^115jG27k], with less weight gain than prednisone [^113yxeGy] but more cataract risk [^115jG27k]; monitor for **adrenal suppression**, infections, and growth effects [^114jwppk] [^115mhRek]. Dose adjust with **CYP3A4 inhibitors** [^113Msdi1] and avoid abrupt withdrawal [^115mhRek].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Deflazacort is a prodrug converted to 21-desDFZ [^113E8fdr], which binds the glucocorticoid receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [^111F3ZKm]; the exact mechanism in DMD is unknown [^113E8fdr].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid oral absorption with a median Tmax of ~1 hour [^113E8fdr]; food reduces Cmax by ~30% and delays Tmax by ~1 hour without changing AUC [^111F3ZKm]. Protein binding of the active metabolite is ~40% [^113E8fdr], and elimination is predominantly urinary, with ~68% excreted within 24 hours [^111F3ZKm].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Muscle strength**: Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day significantly improves average muscle strength versus placebo at 12 weeks, with persistence at 52 weeks [^111gZCZJ] [^115nCra5].

- **Functional outcomes**: Improves timed function tests (rise from supine, climb 4 stairs, walk/run 30 feet) versus placebo at 12 weeks [^114hyoZH].

- **Delay in ambulation loss**: Observational data suggest deflazacort delays loss of ambulation by ~2–3 years versus no steroids, and may delay it more than prednisone/prednisolone [^115jG27k] [^114yCiUF].

---

## Safety profile

- **Common adverse effects**: Cushingoid appearance, weight gain, hirsutism, acne, mood/behavior changes, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset, and growth suppression [^112p3gdW] [^1161giJ9].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Adrenal suppression, infections, cataracts, osteoporosis, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and psychiatric effects [^114jwppk] [^1122Tux4].

- **Comparative safety**: Less weight gain than prednisone [^113yxeGy] but more cataract risk; behavioral effects are similar [^115jG27k] [^112Z3EXA].

---

## Dosage and administration

The **recommended dose** is 0.9 mg/kg/day orally [^notfound]; the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose is not recommended due to more adverse effects without added benefit [^111gZCZJ]. For **CYP3A4 interactions**, reduce the dose to one third with moderate/strong inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice) [^113Msdi1] and avoid strong inducers (e.g. rifampin) [^113Msdi1].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Growth and bone health**: Monitor height, weight, and bone density regularly [^notfound].

- **Ophthalmologic monitoring**: Regular eye exams for cataracts [^notfound].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Gradual taper to avoid withdrawal; monitor for adrenal insufficiency [^115mhRek].

- **Infection risk**: Monitor for infections, especially in immunocompromised patients [^114GBh8J].

---

## Special populations

In hepatic impairment, **no dose adjustment** is needed in mild to moderate liver disease [^111ZiqGa] [^117WDqGQ]; there is no guidance for severe impairment [^114WsXfE]. In renal impairment, **no dose adjustment** is required [^113pEj6p] [^112jV97a]. In pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh risks; monitor neonates for hypoadrenalism [^1136sPqn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current **guidelines** recommend corticosteroids, including deflazacort, as standard of care for DMD to preserve muscle strength and delay disease progression [^112Z3EXA] [^112C2b4n]. The **choice of steroid** should be individualized based on patient characteristics, side-effect profile, and access [^113t6tB4] [^112X3e7G].

---

Deflazacort is an effective corticosteroid for DMD that improves strength and delays ambulation loss, with a favorable weight profile but higher cataract risk; careful monitoring and dose management are essential.

Compared with the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day group, the deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day group demonstrated a small additional benefit compared to placebo at Week 12, but had a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Therefore, use of a 1.2 mg/kg/day dosage of EMFLAZA is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Although not a pre-specified statistical analysis, compared with placebo, the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group demonstrated at Week 52 the persistence of the treatment effect observed at Week 12 and the small advantage of the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose that was observed at Week 12 was no longer present. Also not statistically controlled for multiple comparisons, results on several timed measures of patient function (i.e., time to stand from supine, time to climb 4 stairs, and time to walk or run 30 feet) numerically favored deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day at Week 12, in comparison with placebo.

An additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week clinical trial evaluated deflazacort in comparison to placebo (Study 2). The study population consisted of 29 male children 6 to 12 years of age with a DMD diagnosis confirmed by the documented presence of abnormal dystrophin or a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene. The results of the analysis of the primary endpoint of average muscle strength scores in Study 2 (graded on a 0–5 scale) at 2 years were not statistically significant, possibly because of a limited number of patients remaining in the placebo arm (subjects were discontinued from the trial when they lost ambulation). Although not statistically controlled for multiple comparisons, average muscle strength scores at Months 6 and 12, as well as the average time to loss of ambulation, numerically favored deflazacort in comparison with placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of deflazacort vs prednisone and placebo for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^113yxeGy]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective:

To assess safety and efficacy of deflazacort (DFZ) and prednisone (PRED) vs placebo in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Methods:

This phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated muscle strength among 196 boys aged 5–15 years with DMD during a 52-week period. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment with DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d, PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d, or placebo for 12 weeks. In phase 2, placebo participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups. Participants originally assigned to an active treatment continued that treatment for an additional 40 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was average change in muscle strength from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo. The study was completed in 1995.

Results:

All treatment groups (DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d, and PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d) demonstrated significant improvement in muscle strength compared with placebo at 12 weeks. Participants taking PRED had significantly more weight gain than placebo or both doses of DFZ at 12 weeks; at 52 weeks, participants taking PRED had significantly more weight gain than both DFZ doses. The most frequent adverse events in all 3 active treatment arms were Cushingoid appearance, erythema, hirsutism, increased weight, headache, and nasopharyngitis.

Conclusions:

After 12 weeks of treatment, PRED and both doses of DFZ improved muscle strength compared with placebo. Deflazacort was associated with less weight gain than PRED.

Classification of evidence:

This study provides Class I evidence that for boys with DMD, daily use of either DFZ and PRED is effective in preserving muscle strength over a 12-week period.

Efficacy evaluations.

The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated a significant LS mean difference in favor of DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d (0.25 vs −0.1, p = 0.017, 95% CI 0.04–0.46), DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d (0.36 vs −0.1, p = 0.0003, 95% CI 0.14–0.57), and PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d (0.37 vs −0.1, p = 0.0002, 95% CI 0.15–0.59) compared with placebo in muscle strength at 12 weeks (figure 2A). Significant improvements in motor function with the active treatments occurred with DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d (p = 0.0018), DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d (p = 0.0002), and PRED (p = 0.0016) in time from supine to standing vs placebo; time to climb 4 stairs (p < 0.0001 for all active treatments vs placebo); and time to run or walk 30 feet (p < 0.0001 for all active treatments vs placebo) at week 12. The absolute time to propel a wheelchair 30 feet was faster in the 3 treatment groups compared with placebo; however, these results were not significant.

### Deflazacort [^115nCra5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of deflazacort for the treatment of DMD was established in Study 1, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study conducted in the US and Canada. The study population consisted of 196 male pediatric patients 5 to 15 years of age with documented mutation of the dystrophin gene, onset of weakness before 5 years of age, and serum creatinine kinase activity at least 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some stage in their illness. Patients were randomized to therapy with deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day or 1.2 mg/kg/day), an active comparator, or placebo. A comparison to placebo was made after 12 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks, placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or the active comparator; all patients continued treatment for an additional 40 weeks. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment arms.

In Study 1, efficacy was evaluated by assessing the change between Baseline and Week 12 in average strength of 18 muscle groups. Individual muscle strength was graded using a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) 11-point scale, with higher scores representing greater strength.

The change in average muscle strength score between Baseline and Week 12 was significantly greater for the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group than for the placebo group (see Table 2).

### A review of deflazacort for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112X3e7G]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: The objective of this article is to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, dosage and administration, and formulary considerations of deflazacort. Data Sources: A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1946 to December 31, 2019) was conducted using the terms deflazacort and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Results were limited to clinical trials, humans, and English. Additional sources and data were obtained from the references of included articles and prescribing information. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All articles published after July 2014 related to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of the therapy in human subjects were included. Data Synthesis: Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/d is a once-daily oral corticosteroid and is the first drug of its class to be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for DMD. Studies with deflazacort show improved functional outcomes, delayed onset of cardiomyopathy, reduction in scoliosis surgery, and improved survival, but these improvements are supported by relatively weak evidence. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review presents data from studies published after the most recent DMD 2016 treatment guidelines and offers prescribing considerations, including pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, formulary considerations, and areas of uncertainty. Conclusions: Deflazacort presents an additional, FDA-approved corticosteroid option for patients that offers improved quality of life for DMD patients. However, there is weak evidence to support these benefits; a full risk-benefit analysis considering adverse events, efficacy, cost, and previous trials of steroid therapy is necessary when selecting therapy. Further research will help clarify deflazacort's optimal dose, duration of treatment, and impact on quality of life.

5.1 Alterations
in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as deflazacort oral suspension, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving deflazacort oral suspension for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after deflazacort oral suspension withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

Procedures.

Efficacy assessments.

The primary efficacy assessment was the change from baseline to week 12 in average muscle strength as assessed by modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, used in previous studies with PRED. The study was completed in 1995, at which time the 6-minute walk distance test was not used as an endpoint. The MRC scale was considered the most relevant efficacy measure based on previous studies during this time. Participants were asked to perform specific muscle strength assessments by a trained physiotherapist in various positions (sitting, prone, side-lying, and supine) at each study visit to evaluate any change in disease severity during the study and graded with an 11-point scale.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in average muscle strength from week 12 to week 52 and pulmonary function testing (i.e. forced vital capacity [FVC] and maximum voluntary ventilation). Additional endpoints included timed functional testing: standing from lying position; climbing 4 stairs; running/walking 30 feet; and propelling a wheelchair 30 feet. In addition, physicians made a global assessment of each participant's disease severity at each visit using the Response Visual Analog Scale (0 mm = no symptoms; 100 mm = as bad as it could be).

Safety assessments.

Safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory findings or physical examinations, and vital signs (including weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]). In addition, change in statural growth percentiles was evaluated.

Sensitivity analyses

Analyses among deflazacort users at baseline were possible for comparisons of RWD/NHD against placebo arms from the tadalafil DMD phase 3 and ataluren phase 3 trials; these were the only 2 trials that reported outcomes in deflazacort-treated subpopulations. Analyses were done only among deflazacort users because deflazacort was the corticosteroid predominantly used in the RWD/NHD sources analyzed here. As in the primary analyses, mean Δ6MWD was similar between the trial placebo arms and RWD/NHD sources in this subgroup (table 5). Separately, sensitivity analyses based on follow-up visits spanning 10 to 12 months of follow-up in RWD/NHD data sources yielded results similar to those observed in the primary analyses: differences in mean Δ6MWD between trial placebo arms and harmonized RWD/NHD cohorts ranged from −18.3 to 20.4 m, and none reached statistical significance (results not shown).

Covariate adjustment

Analyses with adjustment for baseline covariates were based on 822 intervals of follow-up among patients in placebo arms of the tadalafil phase 3, ataluren phase 2b, and ataluren phase 3 trials (239 intervals from 239 patients) and from the Leuven, ImagingDMD, and PRO-DMD-01 RWD/NHD sources (583 intervals from 274 patients). In this sample, the difference in mean Δ6MWD between placebo and RWD/NHD before adjustment was −8.7 m (p = 0.2), numerically indicating greater decline in placebo than in RWD/NHD. After adjustment for known baseline prognostic factors, the difference in mean Δ6MWD was 7.7 m (95% confidence interval −3.8 to 19.3; p = 0.2).

### Deflazacort oral (deflazacort oral suspension) [^113CTdFV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of deflazacort oral suspension for the treatment of DMD was established in Study 1, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study conducted in the US and Canada. The study population consisted of 196 male pediatric patients 5 to 15 years of age with documented mutation of the dystrophin gene, onset of weakness before 5 years of age, and serum creatinine kinase activity at least 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some stage in their illness. Patients were randomized to therapy with deflazacort (0.9 or 1.2 mg/kg/day), an active comparator, or placebo. A comparison to placebo was made after 12 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks, placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or the active comparator; all patients continued treatment for an additional 40 weeks. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment arms.

In Study 1, efficacy was evaluated by assessing the change between Baseline and Week 12 in average strength of 18 muscle groups. Individual muscle strength was graded using a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) 11-point scale, with higher scores representing greater strength.

The change in average muscle strength score between Baseline and Week 12 was significantly greater for the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group than for the placebo group (see Table 2).

### Effect of deflazacort on pregnancy outcome in kidney transplant patients: should we change the immunosuppressant before conception? [^113Jamtw]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study was subject to several limitations. First, our study had a small number of patients and was of retrospective design. There may be a selective bias as kidney transplant patients who failed to conceive, but did not seek fertility treatment might be missed. However, as kidney transplant patients are usually very concerned about how their fertility is effected by their medication use, we believe that most would discuss infertility at length with their primary physician and seek further help if needed. Nonetheless, it may be unclear as to whether infertility in these patients is due to the immunosuppressant use or the fact that they did not seek fertility treatment. Secondly, as DFZ use was limited to certain diseases and countries, long-term reference data was unavailable. Finally, it is unclear as to how the immunosuppressants may interact with each other and whether they will negatively impact fertility. On the other hand, the strength of our study is that, for the first time, we showed a possible detrimental effect of DFZ in terms of implantation and success of pregnancy. To our knowledge, excluding the report demonstrating TAC as a basic immunosuppressive agent that achieved a high rate of successful pregnancy, this is the only study that investigated the effect of immunosuppressant use in fertility and pregnancy outcome.

### Corticosteroids for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112Z3EXA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. Untreated, this incurable disease, which has an X-linked recessive inheritance, is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability, leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is a major aim of treatment. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that corticosteroids significantly improve muscle strength and function in boys with DMD in the short term (six months), and strength at two years (two-year data on function are very limited). Corticosteroids, now part of care recommendations for DMD, are largely in routine use, although questions remain over their ability to prolong walking, when to start treatment, longer-term balance of benefits versus harms, and choice of corticosteroid or regimen. We have extended the scope of this updated review to include comparisons of different corticosteroids and dosing regimens.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking ability, muscle strength, functional ability, and quality of life in DMD; to address the question of whether benefit is maintained over the longer term (more than two years); to assess adverse events; and to compare efficacy and adverse effects of different corticosteroid preparations and regimens.

Search Methods

On 16 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts. We checked references in identified trials, handsearched journal abstracts, and searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We considered RCTs or quasi-RCTs of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort) given for a minimum of three months to patients with a definite DMD diagnosis. We considered comparisons of different corticosteroids, regimens, and corticosteroids versus placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies (667 participants) and two new ongoing studies for inclusion. Six RCTs were newly included at this update and important non-randomised cohort studies have also been published. Some important studies remain unpublished and not all published studies provide complete outcome data.

Primary Outcome Measure

one two-year deflazacort RCT (n = 28) used prolongation of ambulation as an outcome measure but data were not adequate for drawing conclusions.

Secondary Outcome Measures

meta-analyses showed that corticosteroids (0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone or prednisolone) improved muscle strength and function versus placebo over six months (moderate quality evidence from up to four RCTs). Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function measures, with little evidence of further benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), timed walk, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade, and forced vital capacity. One new RCT (n = 66), reported better strength, function and quality of life with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone at 12 months. One RCT (n = 28) showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength versus placebo at two years, but timed function test results were too imprecise for conclusions to be drawn. One double-blind RCT (n = 64), largely at low risk of bias, compared daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) with weekend-only prednisone (5 mg/kg/weekend day), finding no overall difference in muscle strength and function over 12 months (moderate to low quality evidence). Two small RCTs (n = 52) compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but study methods limited our ability to compare muscle strength or function.

Adverse Effects

excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth were all previously shown to be more common with corticosteroids than placebo; we assessed the quality of evidence (for behavioural changes and weight gain) as moderate. Hair growth and cushingoid features were more frequent at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone. Comparing daily versus weekend-only prednisone, both groups gained weight with no clear difference in body mass index (BMI) or in behavioural changes (low quality evidence for both outcomes, one study); the weekend-only group had a greater linear increase in height. Very low quality evidence suggested less weight gain with deflazacort than with prednisone at 12 months, and no difference in behavioural abnormalities. Data are insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts for any comparison. Non-randomised studies support RCT evidence in showing improved functional benefit from corticosteroids. These studies suggest sustained benefit for up to 66 months. Adverse effects were common, although generally manageable. According to a large comparative longitudinal study of daily or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) corticosteroid for a mean period of four years, a daily regimen prolongs ambulation and improves functional scores over the age of seven, but with a greater frequency of side effects than an intermittent regimen.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence from RCTs indicates that corticosteroid therapy in DMD improves muscle strength and function in the short term (twelve months), and strength up to two years. On the basis of the evidence available for strength and function outcomes, our confidence in the effect estimate for the efficacy of a 0.75 mg/kg/day dose of prednisone or above is fairly secure. There is no evidence other than from non-randomised trials to establish the effect of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common with corticosteroids than placebo, but not clinically severe. A weekend-only prednisone regimen is as effective as daily prednisone in the short term (12 months), according to low to moderate quality evidence from a single trial, with no clear difference in BMI (low quality evidence). Very low quality evidence indicates that deflazacort causes less weight gain than prednisone after a year's treatment. We cannot evaluate long-term benefits and hazards of corticosteroid treatment or intermittent regimens from published RCTs. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits, but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment, and a possible divergence of efficacy in daily and weekend-only regimens in the longer term. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research and clinical practice.

### Deflazacort vs prednisone treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a meta-analysis of disease progression rates in recent multicenter clinical trials [^1121Vgsq]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

An important strength of the meta‐analysis presented here is that it is based on data from two large, modern, high‐quality phase 3 clinical trials in DMD, both of which used standardized and validated clinical endpoints to assess functional change over time. In addition, consistent statistical approaches were used to measure average change in functioning over time in both studies.

This study also has some important limitations. As corticosteroid assignment was not randomized, results may be confounded by unobserved baseline differences between the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups. Nonetheless, adjustments were made for observed differences such as corticosteroid duration, corticosteroid regimen, age, and baseline 6MWD; the smaller declines observed in deflazacort patients in the respective trial populations were robust to these adjustments. As deflazacort was not commercially available in the United States until 2017, it is possible that, over the time frame of these trials, deflazacort use in the United States would have been more prevalent among patients from higher socioeconomic status (SES) families, who would generally be expected to have access to better supportive care. As markers of SES were not available in this study, an adjustment for this potential confounding factor could not be carried out. However, in both trials, patients from the United States made up a relatively small proportion of all placebo arm patients (28% and 32% of all patients in ACT DMD and tadalafil DMD trial placebo arms, respectively), and it appears unlikely that differences in these relatively small subsets of the population would be large enough to explain the overall consistent treatment benefit seen in the population. In general, deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone use varied by region, and region‐specific differences in patient care may also have contributed to the observed differences in disease progression. Future analyses of pooled individual patient data will be able to investigate possible region‐specific differences, as well as other possible subpopulation differences in treatment patterns and outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Approximately 1 in every 5000 live male births 1 is affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an inherited, X‐linked disease caused by mutations to the gene encoding dystrophin. 2

The corticosteroids deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone are standards of care for the treatment of DMD. 3 Both drugs appear to improve muscle strength and slow disease progression, 4, 5, 6, 7 and their increased use in early patient management is credited with changing the natural history of the disease. 6, 8 Although prednisone/prednisolone is currently used off‐label to treat DMD, deflazacort was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with DMD who are 5 years or older.

As only a few studies have involved both deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients, there has thus far been limited investigations of their comparative efficacy on functional outcomes, particularly in the context of modern supportive care, physical therapy, and rigorous clinical trial evaluation. One recent study in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) natural history cohort 9 reported a lower rate of ambulation loss among deflazacort‐treated patients in comparison to prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients. 6 However, analyses of placebo arm data from recently completed DMD clinical trials can provide additional information about the comparative efficacy of these drugs, as patients in trial placebo arms are required to be on stable corticosteroid dosing regimens at trial entry, and allowed to continue using stable doses of corticosteroids for the duration of the trial. In addition, trial patients receive a broad range of functional assessments, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of the impacts of corticosteroids on different markers of disease progression.

In this study we compare disease progression rates between patients receiving these corticosteroids in the placebo arms of two recently concluded and independent phase 3 trials: the tadalafil DMD trial 10 and the Ataluren Confirmatory Trial in DMD (ACT DMD). 11 The aim of our study was to obtain a pooled estimate of the difference in progression rates, over a 48‐week period, between patients who were receiving deflazacort vs prednisone/prednisolone.

Second, these analyses reflect differences over a 48‐week time horizon in a clinical trial setting; comparative effectiveness over longer periods of use in natural history settings warrant further study. Although recent studies in the CINRG cohort have suggested long‐term benefit of deflazacort on preservation of functional abilities, 6, 22 further analyses in other natural history cohorts will be useful to confirm these findings, more precisely quantify long‐term functional benefit, and inform decisionmaking on the trade‐off between functional improvement and the risk of side‐effects associated with each corticosteroid.

As uncertainty still remains about the efficacy of specific corticosteroid regimens, a variety of dosing regimens are used in practice. 29 Differences in dosing regimens were present within the corticosteroid groups in our study as well. Daily dosing regimens were more common in the deflazacort group in both studies, perhaps reflecting differences in tolerability between these steroids. In ACT DMD, 84% of deflazacort‐treated patients and 64% of prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients were on a daily regimen at baseline, compared with 86% of deflazacort‐treated patients and 60% of prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients in the tadalafil DMD trial. However, declines in 6MWD remained lower among deflazacort‐treated patients even after adjusting for differences in steroid regimen. Absolute daily doses were lower in prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients, probably because the starting dose for this cohort of patients was lower (0.75 mg/kg/d) compared with the deflazacort group (0.9 mg/kg/d). However, the percentage of the recommended starting dose was actually higher for prednisone/prednisolone than deflazacort in the tadalafil study, but lower for prednisone/prednisolone in the ACT DMD study. Thus, dose reductions due to adverse events would not be a plausible explanation for the consistently lower rates of clinical progression favoring deflazacort across both studies.

The finding of slower disease progression among patients receiving deflazacort is consistent with the other studies 9, 20, 21 that directly compared deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone treatment in patients with DMD. One randomized trial, completed in 1995, showed that both corticosteroids were effective in preserving muscle strength relative to placebo, over a 12‐week period. 20 In the trial, relative to 0.75 mg/kg/d prednisone, 0.9 mg/kg/d deflazacort was associated with improved muscle strength from week 12 to week 52, and numerically greater improvements from baseline to week 52. 20 Another trial of 18 patients, completed in 2000, showed no difference in functioning between deflazacort and prednisone patients. 21 More recently, a study in the CINRG natural history cohort 9 showed both corticosteroids to be effective in preserving function relative to no treatment, but also noted a lower rate of loss of ambulation among deflazacort‐treated patients relative to prednisone/prednisolone. 6, 22 Another recent investigation of longer term glucocorticoid use in CINRG also found that deflazacort‐treated patients, in comparison to prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients, demonstrated an approximately 2‐year delay in median age at loss of ability to stand from supine, a 2.7‐year delay in median age at loss of ambulation, and a 2.7‐year delay in age at loss of hand‐to‐mouth function (defined as transition to a Brooke upper extremity function score of ≥ 5). 6

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patients and/or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling if deflazacort oral suspension is prescribed (Instructions for Use).

Administration

Warn patients and/or caregivers to not stop taking deflazacort oral suspension abruptly or without first checking with their healthcare providers as there may be a need for gradual dose reduction to decrease the risk of adrenal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Deflazacort oral suspension may be taken with or without food. Do not take deflazacort oral suspension with grapefruit juice.

Oral Suspension

Deflazacort oral suspension must be shaken well prior to measuring out each dose with the enclosed oral dispenser.
The deflazacort oral suspension dose may be placed in 3–4 ounces of juice (except grapefruit juice) or milk, mixed thoroughly, and immediately administered.
Discard any unused deflazacort oral suspension remaining after 1 month of first opening the bottle.

Increased Risk of Infection

Tell patients and/or caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if the patient has had recent or ongoing infections or if they have recently received a vaccine. Medical advice should be sought immediately if the patient develops fever or other signs of infection. Patients and/or caregivers should be made aware that some infections can potentially be severe and fatal.

### Deflazacort versus prednisone / prednisolone for maintaining motor function and delaying loss of ambulation: a post HOC analysis from the ACT DMD trial [^115baspN]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare, irreversible, X‐linked disorder, results in a progressive decline in muscle function and when left untreated, leads to loss of ambulation (LoA) by age 10–12 years and death from cardiac or respiratory failure by the late teens to approximately 25 years of age. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The current standard of care for DMD includes corticosteroid therapy with prednisone, prednisolone, or deflazacort, 2 with accumulating evidence suggesting that these agents can slow the decline in muscle strength and motor function, delay LoA, possibly decrease the development of scoliosis requiring operative management, and slow the loss of upper limb function and the rate of pulmonary function decline. 5, 6, 7, 8

Deflazacort is a synthetic corticosteroid characterized by the insertion of a fused methyl‐oxazoline ring in the chemical structure of prednisone, with a long duration of action. 9 A phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 12‐week trial of 2 doses of deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/d and 1.2 mg/kg/d) or prednisone dosed at 0.75 mg/kg/d showed that each dosage level of deflazacort or prednisone increased muscle strength from baseline compared with placebo in just 12 weeks. 10

The objective of this post hoc analysis from a previously published study 11 is to compare the efficacy and safety of deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone in slowing DMD disease progression as it relates to physical functioning and the potential for delay in LoA.

### Effect of different corticosteroid dosing regimens on clinical outcomes in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^114VSqZW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Corticosteroids improve strength and function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, there is uncertainty regarding the optimum regimen and dosage.

Objective

To compare efficacy and adverse effects of the 3 most frequently prescribed corticosteroid regimens in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial including 196 boys aged 4 to 7 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had not previously been treated with corticosteroids; enrollment occurred between January 30, 2013, and September 17, 2016, at 32 clinic sites in 5 countries. The boys were assessed for 3 years (last participant visit on October 16, 2019).

Interventions

Participants were randomized to daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) (n = 65), daily deflazacort (0.90 mg/kg) (n = 65), or intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg for 10 days on and then 10 days off) (n = 66).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The global primary outcome comprised 3 end points: rise from the floor velocity (in rise/seconds), forced vital capacity (in liters), and participant or parent global satisfaction with treatment measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM; score range, 0 to 100), each averaged across all study visits after baseline. Pairwise group comparisons used a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of .017.

Results

Among the 196 boys randomized (mean age, 5.8 years [SD, 1.0 years]), 164 (84%) completed the trial. Both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone for the primary outcome (P < .001 for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone using a global test; p = 0.017 for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone using a global test) and the daily regimens did not differ significantly (P = .38 for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort using a global test). The between-group differences were principally attributable to rise from the floor velocity (0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.08 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone [P = .003]; 0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.09 rise/s] for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone [P = .017]; and -0.004 rise/s [98.3% CI, -0.03 to 0.02 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort [P = .75]). The pairwise comparisons for forced vital capacity and TSQM global satisfaction subscale score were not statistically significant. The most common adverse events were abnormal behavior (22 [34%] in the daily prednisone group, 25 [38%] in the daily deflazacort group, and 24 [36%] in the intermittent prednisone group), upper respiratory tract infection (24 [37%], 19 [29%], and 24 [36%], respectively), and vomiting (19 [29%], 17 [26%], and 15 [23%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, treatment with daily prednisone or daily deflazacort, compared with intermittent prednisone alternating 10 days on and 10 days off, resulted in significant improvement over 3 years in a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment; there was no significant difference between the 2 daily corticosteroid regimens. The findings support the use of a daily corticosteroid regimen over the intermittent prednisone regimen tested in this study as initial treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

### Respiratory care of the patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: ATS consensus statement [^112C2b4n]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids in DMD — use patterns, potential benefits, and recommendations are outlined. The statement notes that "Oral corticosteroids have been found to increase muscle mass and retard muscle deterioration in patients with DMD", and that in most studies therapy "was initiated between 5 and 15 years of age, and at an average of approximately 8 years of age". It adds that "Deflazacort, an oxazoline derivative of prednisone, has been shown to have similar benefits to prednisone, with possibly fewer side effects", and that "Boys who received deflazacort maintain ambulation longer and have significant sparing of pulmonary function". Recommendations emphasize that "Future research is required to confirm and further define the potential pulmonary benefits of oral steroids", and that "Decisions to start oral steroid therapy to help preserve lung function should be made in collaboration with the neuromuscular specialist and other members of the multidisciplinary care team and the family".

### Deflazacort versus prednisone / prednisolone for maintaining motor function and delaying loss of ambulation: a post HOC analysis from the ACT DMD trial [^117DNpJ1]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction: ACT DMD was a 48‐week trial of ataluren for nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD). Patients received corticosteroids for ≥ 6 months at entry and stable regimens throughout study. This post hoc analysis compares efficacy and safety for deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone in the placebo arm. Methods: Patients received deflazacort (n = 53) or prednisone/prednisolone (n = 61). Endpoints included change from baseline in 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD), timed function tests, estimated age at loss of ambulation (extrapolated from 6MWD). Results: Mean changes in 6MWD were ‐39.0 m (deflazacort; 95% confidence limit [CL], ‐68.85, ‐9.17) and ‐70.6 m (prednisone/prednisolone; 95% CL, ‐97.16, ‐44.02). Mean changes in 4‐stair climb were 3.79 s (deflazacort; 95% CL, 1.54, 6.03) and 6.67 s (prednisone/prednisolone; 95% CL, 4.69, 8.64). Conclusions: This analysis, limited by its post hoc nature, suggests greater preservation of 6MWD and 4‐stair climb with deflazacort vs. prednisone/prednisolone. A head‐to‐head comparison will better define these differences. Muscle Nerve 58: 639–645, 2018

### Deflazacort vs prednisone treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a meta-analysis of disease progression rates in recent multicenter clinical trials [^115Hgqbc]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

No significant heterogeneity was detected across the two trials, supporting the use of a fixed‐effects meta‐analysis to pool the included data. However, with only two trials included, our study may not represent the variability in steroid associations that may be observed among a larger number of trials or data sources.

Last, this meta‐analysis pertains to only efficacy measures reported from the two trials in an ambulatory population. Although there are long‐term reports of upper limb functional preservation in deflazacort‐treated patients relative to prednisone/prednisolone treatment, upper limb and pulmonary endpoints were not assessed in these two trials conducted in ambulatory patients. Finally, the underlying clinical trials were not designed to systematically measure adverse effects of specific corticosteroid regimens.

Ongoing clinical trials, such as the Finding the Optimum Regimen for DMD (FOR DMD) trial (identifier: NCT01603407), may provide definitive evidence for the efficacy of specific dosing regimens in the younger 4‐ to 7‐year‐old populations of children with DMD. Although this randomized clinical trial will yield valuable data from previously steroid‐naive patients, it may require longer follow‐up or an older population of patients with DMD, as assessed in the long‐term natural history studies, to compare the relative long‐term efficacy between deflazacort and prednisone, as these younger populations in the FOR DMD trial have less fatty replacement of muscle.

Combining individual patient data from the placebo arms of the multiple recently completed phase 2 and 3 trials in DMD 10, 11, 30, 31 may be valuable in facilitating more granular assessments of the comparative efficacy of deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone dosing regimens currently used in clinical practice. In the interim, the present meta‐analysis of summary data from two recent, high‐quality, phase 3 trial placebo arms complements the evidence supporting differences in functional change associated with steroid type in modern clinical practice.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics in each trial are summarized in Table 1. Patients receiving deflazacort were, on average, slightly older than those receiving prednisone/prednisolone. In both trial arms, the proportion of patients with at least 12 months of prior corticosteroid use and the proportion of patients receiving a daily regimen were higher among deflazacort than among prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients. In both trial placebo arms, mean baseline 6MWD was similar between the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics in tadalafil DMD trial and ACT DMD placebo arms

Among patients on a daily dosing regimen, in the tadalafil DMD trial placebo arm, the mean dose among prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients was 0.579 mg/kg/d (77.2% of the recommended dose) vs 0.655 mg/kg/d (72.8% of the recommended dose) among deflazacort‐treated patients. In the ACT DMD placebo, mean doses were 0.515 mg/kg/d (68.7% of the recommended dose) and 0.695 mg/kg/d (77.2% of the recommended dose) among prednisone/prednisolone‐ and deflazacort‐treated patients, respectively. 16 Both trials required a stable dose of steroids over the 6 months prior to enrollment, but did not impose any requirements on frequency or dose.

3.2 Disease progression outcomes in each trial

For 6MWD outcomes at week 48, average declines in deflazacort‐treated patients were approximately 25 meters less in the tadalafil DMD trial placebo arm, and 32 meters less in the ACT DMD placebo arm compared with prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients (Table 2). For timed function tests, compared with the prednisone/prednisolone group, those receiving deflazacort experienced smaller or comparable numerical declines in mean function (Table 2).

### Glucocorticoid corticosteroids for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^116krZNv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. This incurable disease is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is one of the major aims of treatment.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess whether glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize or improve muscle strength and walking in boys with DMD.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised register (October 2003) using the term 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'. We also searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2003), CINAHL and LILACS (January 1982 to October 2003). We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts in this disease to help identify other trials, checked the references in the identified trials and handsearched the abstracts of relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised trials.

Types Of Participants

all patients with a definite diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Types of interventions: glucocorticoids such as prednisone, prednisolone, deflazacort or others, with a minimum treatment period of three months.

Primary Outcome Measure

prolongation of walking (independent walking without long leg calipers).

Secondary Outcome Measures

strength outcome measures, manual muscle strength testing using Medical Research Council strength scores, functional outcome measures and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified five randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for our review. Two reviewers independently selected the trials for the review and assessed methodological quality. Data extraction and inputting were double-checked.

Primary Outcome Measure

data from one small study used prolongation of walking as an outcome measure and did not show significant benefit.

Secondary Outcome Measures

The meta-analysis of the results from three randomised controlled trials showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), nine metres walking time, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade and forced vital capacity. One randomised controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize muscle strength and function for up to two years. The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. Not enough data were available to compare efficacy of prednisone with deflazacort. Adverse effects: Excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance and excessive hair growth were all more common with glucocorticoid corticosteroids than placebo. Long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy could not be evaluated because of the short-term duration of the randomised studies. Non-randomised studies: a number of non-randomised studies with important efficacy and adverse effects data are tabulated and discussed.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is evidence from randomised controlled studies that glucocorticoid corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy improves muscle strength and function in the short-term (six months to two years). The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of glucocorticoid treatment cannot be evaluated from the currently published randomised studies. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits but also indicate clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research studies and clinical practice.

### Relationship between growth and ambulation loss in Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys on steroids [^116eEUii]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disease affecting 1 in 5000 to 1 in 6250 live male births, caused by pathogenic variants affecting the expression of the dystrophin gene. Boys with DMD typically achieve peak motor function at the age of 7 years, followed by a decline in motor abilities and loss of ambulation at the age of approximately 12 years.

Glucocorticoids (GCs), namely prednisone (or its active metabolite prednisolone) and deflazacort, remain the primary standard of care treatment for DMD, despite significant efforts to develop novel therapies that restore dystrophin expression. In the UK, GCs are prescribed primarily on a daily or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) regimen. GC treatment delays loss of ambulation compared to GC naïve boys by between 1 and 3 years, with daily GCs preserving long‐term motor function more effectively than intermittent GCs. The double‐blind randomized FOR‐DMD clinical trial (: NCT01603407) showed that both daily deflazacort and prednisone improved motor function more than intermittent prednisone over a 3‐year period. Although loss of ambulation was not captured in the FOR‐DMD study, observational studies have shown that deflazacort is more effective in delaying loss of ambulation compared to prednisone/prednisolone.

For determination of LoA, the 48‐week changes from baseline in 6MWD observed in patients taking deflazacort or prednisone/prednisolone were annualized. For patients who did not reach LoA by Week 48, linear extrapolation was used to estimate the number of years it would take to reach LoA (a 6MWD of 0 m) according to the method of Clayton and colleagues. 17 This model, however, does not consider the potential nonlinear decline in 6MWD in older patients with DMD. 18

The duration of exposure to either corticosteroid before study entry was determined using the following assumptions: (1) if end date of corticosteroid therapy before study entry was missing, the end date was noted as the start date of placebo; (2) if end date of corticosteroid therapy before study entry was on or after the start date of placebo, the end of corticosteroid therapy was noted as the start date of placebo.

Safety was analyzed in the as‐treated population, which consisted of all randomized patients who received any study treatment. 12

1 Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disease, characterised by muscle wasting, motor function decline and premature mortality. Typically, boys with DMD experience a peak in motor function abilities around the age of 7 years, after which they experience a continuous decline in motor function abilities, leading to a loss of ambulation in untreated boys by the age of 12 years.

Corticosteroids (CS) form the primary treatment approach for boys with DMD and are the only recommended treatment for all patients in the standard of care (SoC) guidance, although novel therapies are at different stages of regulatory approval. Historically, two types of CS have been most prescribed, deflazacort and prednisone (or its active metabolite prednisolone), and in the UK, two treatment regimes are prevalent: daily and intermittent (10‐days‐on, 10‐days‐off), although the prescription of the CS type and regime has changed over the last 10 years and other regimes are popular in other geographical regions. In the placebo arms of trials, CS have been shown to delay key motor function endpoints in both ambulatory and non‐ambulatory patients, although differences in efficacy by CS regime were observed in the FOR‐DMD trial of CS in DMD.

Despite length and weight being in line with non‐DMD peers at birth, boys with DMD exhibit significantly different patterns of growth compared to their non‐DMD peers, as they are on average, shorter than their age‐matched peers within the first few years of life, even without CS treatment, and are on average heavier than their age‐matched peers by age 7–10 years. After starting CS, documented growth‐related side effects like short stature and overweight are common in boys with DMD.

Several studies have reported specific patterns of growth changes related to the type and regime of CS used. Boys on deflazacort tend to be shorter than those on prednisolone, and, similarly, boys on daily regimes are consistently shorter than those on intermittent regimes. Additionally, CS‐driven weight gain has been widely reported, with some studies reporting a lower weight gain in boys treated with deflazacort compared to prednisolone and, to some extent, a tendency to show higher weight gain with daily regimes.

### Suitability of external controls for drug evaluation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114HY1Tn]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

An important factor that could not be fully explored in this study was the use of steroids at different doses or administration frequencies. While all patients included in the analysis were receiving steroids, consistent with standard-of-care recommendations and clinical trial inclusion criteria, the particular steroid types, dosing regimens, and ages at initiation were not always available and are likely to have varied across time and across care centers. Sensitivity analyses conducted among patients receiving deflazacort, which was the most commonly used steroid in the RWD sources with such information available, and multivariable analyses adjusted for steroid type were consistent with the primary analyses and did not indicate any significant differences in ∆6MWD between placebo and RWD/NHD.

Overall, the results of this study provide a strong foundation for use of RWD/NHD in DMD drug development and confirm the worthiness of additional research to extend these findings to additional clinical outcomes and to evaluate different study designs for using RWD/NHD in DMD. The overall promise of such research is further supported by the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) in the United States, which has spurred an increased need for understanding and evaluating appropriate uses of RWD in regulatory decision-making, and an emerging framework for doing so. Representatives of the European Medicines Agency and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have also highlighted the importance of RWD/NHD for drug evaluation. Comparisons to external controls have proved important to drug approvals in several rare diseases, including neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses type 2 (a form of Batten disease)and Pompe disease. Against this background, the use of RWD/NHD in DMD clinical trials is of particular interest because it could make efficient use of existing patient data, facilitate faster trial enrollment, and enable more patients to access active therapies as opposed to placebo.

Results

Identification of studies

The study identification and selection process is illustrated in Figure 1. From the primary search, 11 studies were excluded because of rare and uncommon therapeutic interventions; these studies dealt with gamma globulins in specific solvent, a proton pump inhibitor (monotherapy to eradicate Helicobacter pylori), vinblastine, deflazacort, and various Chinese herbal medicines. – Two RCT dealing with intravenous anti-D globulin were excluded from data integration, because one (comparing anti-D versus routine care) did not report either early OR or long-term SR, and the other compared low- and high-dose anti-D without reference to other treatment arms, resulting in a node unconnected to the other treatment network. A search of conference proceedings revealed one additional relevant study (abstract only). Thus, in total, we included 21 RCT that involved 1898 adult patients with newly diagnosed primary ITP. Individual patients' data were not available in any study.

Methods

Study population

Women with a history of kidney transplantation who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for infertility or antenatal care from January 2005 to May 2016 in Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine were included. Women who were pregnant before transplantation (n = 6), cases lost to follow-up (n = 2), and those who used certain immunosuppressants, such as sirolimus (n = 2) were excluded (Fig. 1). Finally, 40 cases (36 women) were included in this study: 18 cases of 18 infertile women who visited the infertility clinic (infertile group) and 22 cases of 18 pregnant women who visited the antenatal clinic (fertile group) after achieving successful conception within a year of trying to conceive. Prednisolone (Pred) was used as a first line steroid. Deflazacort (DFZ) was chosen instead of Pred in patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, and Cushing syndrome caused by prolonged use of corticosteroids.

Flow chart of participant inclusion in the study

Primary infertility was diagnosed in those who had tried to conceive for more than 1 year without contraception, and secondary infertility was diagnosed in those who had a previous history of pregnancy but failed to conceive for more than 1 year. The duration of attempted conception, cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), time since the transplantation, and whether the patient had graft rejection and hypertension were assessed through a retrospective chart review. The time of data collection for each factor, including the type of immunosuppressant medication, was within the month of the last menstruation in the clinical pregnancy and miscarriage groups or at the start of attempting conception in the never-pregnant group. The never-pregnant and miscarriage groups were merged into the non-pregnant group in analyses to compare with the clinical pregnancy group.

Introduction

In this study we characterized disease progression over 48weeks among boys receiving deflazacort vs prednisone/prednisolone placebo arm treatment in two recent Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) clinical trials.

Methods

Ambulatory boys with DMD receiving placebo in the phase 3 ataluren (N = 115) and tadalafil (N = 116) trials were included. The trials required at least 6months of prior corticosteroid use and stable baseline dosing. Associations between corticosteroid use and 48-week changes in ambulatory function were estimated using mixed models. Adjusted differences between corticosteroid groups were pooled in a meta-analysis.

Results

In the meta-analysis, deflazacort-treated patients vs prednisone/prednisolone-treated patients experienced, on average, lower declines of 28.3 meters on 6-minute walk distance (95% confidence interval, 5.7, 50.9; 2.9seconds on rise from supine [95% CI, 0.9, 4.9seconds]; 2.3seconds on 4-stair climb [95% CI, 0.5, 4.1seconds]; and 2.9 [95% CI, 0.1, 5.8] points on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment linearized score).

Discussion

Deflazacort-treated patients experienced significantly lower functional decline over 48weeks.

### Deflazacort versus prednisone / prednisolone for maintaining motor function and delaying loss of ambulation: a post HOC analysis from the ACT DMD trial [^113t6tB4]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

The DMD Care Considerations guidelines recommend daily dosing of patients with DMD with corticosteroids unless the therapy is not well tolerated, in which case an alternative regimen may be used. 2 The most common corticosteroid dosing regimen for patients in the placebo arm of the ACT DMD trial was once daily. There was a higher percentage of patients on daily deflazacort therapy compared with patients receiving daily prednisone/prednisolone. A possible reason for this observation may be that daily therapy with deflazacort was better tolerated in these patients than daily therapy with prednisone/prednisolone. This reasoning may also be supported by the fact that the daily mean dose was higher relative to the recommended dose for deflazacort than for prednisone/prednisolone. The corticosteroid regimens were determined by the patients' physicians before the study and are thus representative of real‐world use of these agents.

Deflazacort treatment in this post hoc analysis was associated with slightly lower mean growth over 48 weeks than treatment with prednisone/prednisolone. Corticosteroid effects on growth may influence delay of LoA, possibly by conferring biomechanical advantages for walking. 25, 26 A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study in the United Kingdom observed a possible link between shorter stature and delayed LoA in patients with DMD receiving corticosteroids. 15 An analysis of anthropomorphic effects found that patients treated with deflazacort had significantly shorter stature (P < 0.002) than those treated with prednisone over a 52‐week follow‐up. 2, 6

Weight gain may contribute to disability in patients with DMD by increasing the load on deteriorating muscles. Corticosteroid therapy has been associated with weight gain, and some studies in patients with DMD have noted less weight gain with deflazacort than with prednisone, including an analysis of anthropomorphic effects of corticosteroid therapy in DMD 26 and a systematic review of clinical trials of corticosteroid treatment in patients with DMD. 7 Consistent with these studies, patients receiving deflazacort in this post hoc analysis had a lower mean increase in weight than those receiving prednisone/prednisolone and a smaller mean increase in BMI.

(A) Change from baseline, which was calculated as a mean of measurements from visit 1 and visit 2 to week 12. (B) Change from week 12 to week 52. (C) Change from baseline to week 52. Statistical analysis results are from a mixed-effect repeated measure model with a compound symmetry covariance structure and included treatment group, visit, treatment by visit, stratum, and site as fixed effects, with the baseline value as a continuous covariate. p Values are based on the Dunnett test. ✱ p = 0.0459 vs placebo; ✱✱ p = 0.0003 vs prednisone (PRED) 0.75 mg/kg/d; † p = 0.013 vs PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d; ‡ p < 0.0001 vs PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d. DFZ = deflazacort; MRC = Medical Research Council.

From baseline to week 12, DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d had a significantly greater decrease in forearm length percentile compared to placebo (LS mean −4.87 vs 1.04, p = 0.0317) and both DFZ dose groups had significantly greater decrease in forearm length percentile than PRED from baseline to 52 weeks (DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d LS mean −8.05, p = 0.0011; DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d LS mean −4.96, p = 0.0491; PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d LS mean 0.85) (table e-1). There were no differences in changes in height percentile with the active treatments vs placebo at 12 weeks but DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d had significantly greater decreases in height percentile from baseline to 52 weeks vs PRED (DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d LS mean −17.04, p = 0.0015; PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d LS mean −7.04) (table e-1).

METHODS

Study design.

In a multicenter, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 196 boys (age 5–15 years) with DMD were assigned to groups with a permuted block system via telephone, and both study personnel and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The study consisted of 2 phases. In phase 1, eligible participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups stratified by center and by whether the participant was classified as ambulatory or nonambulatory and randomized in blocks of 4: DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d, PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d, or placebo for 12 weeks of treatment. If 2 brothers participated in the study, they were randomized together in the same treatment group to prevent any confusion in taking their medication. After the initial 12 weeks, in phase 2, placebo-treated participants were randomly re-assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups and followed through 52 weeks. Participants originally assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups continued in that study arm for the additional 40 weeks. All participants in each of the treatment groups received the same number of tablets to maintain blinding. The study was conducted between April 26, 1993, and April 20, 1995.

The secondary analysis of change in muscle strength from 12 to 52 weeks demonstrated continued improvement in muscle strength in DFZ-treated participants vs worsening in PRED-treated participants (figure 2B). There was a significant improvement in average muscle strength score from week 12 to week 52 in the DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d group compared with the PRED-treated group (LS mean 0.29, p = 0.044, 95% CI 0.08–0.49). The DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d group had numerical improvement compared to PRED-treated participants from week 12 to week 52 but it did not reach significance (LS mean 0.16, p = 0.18, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.37). From week 12 to week 52, both DFZ groups demonstrated greater numerical improvements in time from supine to stand, time to climb 4 stairs, and time to run or walk 30 feet compared with the PRED-treated participants, but these did not reach significance. From baseline to week 52, participants in the DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d (p = 0.0461) and DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d (p = 0.0012) groups had significant improvement in the time to climb 4 stairs compared with PRED. At week 52, the exploratory efficacy endpoint of change in average muscle strength from baseline showed positive results in favor of both doses of DFZ compared with PRED (figure 2C). Mean ± SD changes in average muscle strength score from baseline at all study visits to week 52 are shown in figure e-1 at.

Physician global assessments did not indicate significant differences among groups at 12 or 52 weeks. Pulmonary function assessments showed a significantly greater benefit with DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d over PRED for the change in FVC from week 12 to week 52. No other differences between treatment groups were observed in assessments of pulmonary function.

2.3.2 Summary data from ACT DMD placebo arm

Disease progression rates among patients in the ACT DMD placebo arm were reported in a recent trial publication. 16 Estimates of the 48‐week change in functional outcomes for patients in each corticosteroid group were extracted from this publication. Patients' baseline characteristics and additional information on analysis specifications were also obtained from the ACT DMD study investigators.

2.3.3 Meta‐analysis of placebo arms

A fixed‐effects meta‐analysis using inverse variance weights was used to obtain combined estimates of disease progression rates from the tadalafil DMD trial and ACT DMD placebo arms. Pooled effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the difference in the 48‐week change between the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups were obtained for each functional outcome. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I 2 measure. No adjustment was applied for multiple comparisons.

2.3.4 Sensitivity analysis

To adjust for differences in steroid regimens between the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups, sensitivity analyses were performed for the analyses of change in the 6MWD. In particular, the MMRM analyses for the 48‐week change in 6MWD in each trial placebo arm were repeated with additional adjustments for the corticosteroid regimen at baseline (categorized as daily use vs non–daily use) and the interaction between corticosteroid regimen and visit week. The results adjusting for corticosteroid regimen in each trial placebo arm were then pooled using the fixed‐effects meta‐analysis approach just detailed.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Give one third of the recommended dosage of deflazacort oral suspension (7.1)
Avoid use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers with deflazacort oral suspension, as they may reduce efficacy (7.1)

7.1 CYP3A4
Inhibitors and Inducers

Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

The active metabolite of deflazacort, 21-desDFZ, is a substrate of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of deflazacort with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased total exposure to 21-desDFZ by about 3-fold. Therefore, give one third the recommended dosage of deflazacort oral suspension when moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, grapefruit juice) are used concomitantly with deflazacort oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Co-administration of deflazacort with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, significantly decreased the exposure of 21-desDFZ. Avoid concomitant use of strong (e.g., efavirenz) or moderate (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) CYP3A4 inducers with deflazacort oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers

Patients receiving corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, and concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium) may be at increased risk of developing an acute myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

### Deflazacort vs prednisone treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a meta-analysis of disease progression rates in recent multicenter clinical trials [^111DRs4Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Handling of the missing data was consistent between deflazacort‐ and prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients within each trial. In ACT DMD, multiple imputation was used to handle missing outcomes data. 16 In the tadalafil DMD trial, a complete case analysis was used. All included patients had at least one follow‐up visit with nonmissing data for each outcome. At the visit level, the proportion of visits with missing data was less than 4% for all outcomes, except for the 10‐meter walk/run, which was missing in 14% of visits. Proportions missing were similar between steroid groups.

2.3 Statistical analysis

2.3.1 Individual patient data from Tadalafil DMD trial placebo arm

First, individual patient data from the tadalafil DMD trial placebo arm were analyzed to estimate disease progression rates in this population. Patients were classified as either deflazacort or prednisone/prednisolone users based on their corticosteroid use at trial enrollment. A mixed model with repeated‐measures (MMRM) analysis parallel to that used in a recent analysis 15 of the ACT DMD placebo arm was used to model change in functional measures in the tadalafil DMD trial placebo arm. Specifically, the mean of the change from baseline for each functional measure at trial visits over time was modeled as a function of visit week (12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks), corticosteroid group (deflazacort vs prednisone/prednisolone), duration of prior corticosteroid use (≥ 6 to < 12 months vs ≥ 12 months), age (< 9 years vs ≥ 9 years), baseline 6MWD category (≥ 350 meters vs < 350 meters), baseline value of the functional measure serving as the outcome, and interactions between visit week and each other characteristic.

The covariance among patients' repeated measures over the 48‐week period was modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix. This assumes that the variances in the outcome measure may differ among visits, and estimates a unique correlation between every pair of study visits. Based on the fitted model, predicted means (least‐squares means) were obtained, and an estimate of the mean and standard error of the difference in 48‐week change between the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups was calculated.

### A phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trial of tadalafil for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^113kSjkm]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The first patient enrolled in September 2013, and the last patient visit for the double-blind trial was in December 2015. An open-label extension study was stopped in January 2016 because tadalafil had no effect on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial. Here, we report the major outcomes of the double-blind trial.

Patient characteristics.

In total, 331 patients were randomized and 316 patients completed the trial (figure 1). One patient randomized to high-dose tadalafil was excluded from the safety analysis because he discontinued before the first dose, but his data were included in the efficacy analysis.

Figure 1
Patient disposition

Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups, with some exceptions (table 1). On average, patients in the placebo group were younger and had a higher baseline 6MWD compared to those in the tadalafil groups, and a smaller proportion of patients in the placebo group had a baseline 6MWD < 300 m. The proportion of patients unable to rise from floor independently and unable to perform the 4-stair climbing and descending tasks was higher in the low-dose tadalafil group compared with the placebo and high-dose tadalafil groups. A higher proportion of boys in the placebo group were taking deflazacort (table 1).

### Effect of deflazacort on pregnancy outcome in kidney transplant patients: should we change the immunosuppressant before conception? [^117NprP8]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the good prognosis in patients with transplant organs, limited evidence is available on how immunosuppressants affect pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine whether immunosuppressant use affects the pregnancy outcome and to identify whether there is any need to change the immunosuppressant before the patient tries to conceive.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included women with previous kidney transplantation history who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for either infertility or antenatal care between January 2005 and May 2016. A total of 40 cases (36 women) met the inclusion criteria. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.

Results

There were no differences in the immunosuppressant regimen between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups (never-pregnant+miscarriage) (P = 0.73). Individual immunosuppressant use was significantly different in terms of pregnancy outcome among the never-pregnant, miscarriage, and clinical pregnancy groups (azathioprine, P = 0.01; deflazacort, P < 0.0001). Only deflazacort use differed significantly between the clinical pregnancy and non-pregnant groups (P = 0.003). After adjusting for factors that may affect pregnancy outcome, deflazacort use remained significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for clinical pregnancy (P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis also showed that deflazacort use was the only remaining factor that could hinder the success of clinical pregnancy (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that the type of immunosuppressive regimen may not affect the success of clinical pregnancy. However, deflazacort may decrease the possibility of clinical pregnancy in women with kidney transplant when they try to conceive.

Physical Functioning

Patients treated with deflazacort had notably less decline from baseline in 6MWD at Week 48 than those treated with prednisone/prednisolone (Table 2; Fig. 1). The extrapolated time to loss of ambulation when using a linear model was 8.58 years for deflazacort and 4.74 years with prednisone/prednisolone, a noteworthy difference.

Table 2
Least squares mean change (95% CL) from baseline to week 48 in assessments of physical functioning and HRQoL (ITT)

Results for the 4‐stair climb showed that the LS mean increase in time from baseline to Week 48 with deflazacort was approximately half of that with prednisone/prednisolone, (Table 2; Fig. 1). For the other TFTs (4‐stair descend, rise from supine, 10‐m walk/run) and the NSAA total score, LS mean changes also notably favored deflazacort (Table 2; Fig. 1).

The mean decline in the domain of Sports/Physical Function in HRQoL for the patients receiving deflazacort was less than that for the patients receiving prednisone/prednisolone (Table 2). The treatment difference for the Transfers/Basic Mobility domain of the PODCI also favored deflazacort.

### Evaluating longitudinal therapy effects via the north star ambulatory assessment [^1133gnyA]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Cumulative curves for placebo‐treated patients who received deflazacort or prednisone/prednisolone revealed a steeper curve for prednisone/prednisolone than for deflazacort, beginning at week 8, after which the curves continued to diverge (Figure 2). The LWYY method demonstrated that the mean cumulative NSAA failure count at week 48 was 2.75 and 3.84 for deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone, respectively. The mean cumulative failure rate reduced by 28% in deflazacort‐treated versus prednisone/prednisolone‐treated patients over the study (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.96; p = .028). Although cumulative failure rate ratios at individual time points may not significantly differ between treatments (group‐wise 95% confidence intervals overlap in the figures), the LWYY procedure considers all time points to demonstrate the totality of treatment effects.

Using a different analytical procedure, the rate ratios of the concurrent failure number at each time point decreased from 1.05 to 0.54 for ataluren versus placebo and from 0.71 to 0.55 for deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone from visit one to six (Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). The mean of these ratios over time was 0.72 and 0.71 respectively, suggesting robust long‐term treatment benefits.

Results

Patient characteristics

The analyses included n = 383 patients on placebo arms, each contributing one ∼48-week follow-up interval, and n = 430 patients contributing a total of 919 ∼48-week follow-up intervals from RWD/NHD sources. The numbers of patients and intervals analyzed varied according to the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to each source (table 3).

Table 3
Patient characteristics in trial placebo arms and RWD/NHD sources subjected to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial

After harmonization of inclusion/exclusion criteria, the mean age was generally older for participants in RWD/NHD sources compared to placebo arms by 1 to 2 years, except for CINRG DNHS, in which boys were closer to 3 years older on average for most comparisons (table 3). In nearly all of the comparisons between trial placebo arms and harmonized RWD/NHD cohorts, baseline 6MWD was within ± 30 m; the largest difference was 74 m for placebo. Data on type of steroid used at baseline were not always available for comparison between trials and RWD/NHD sources. However, for comparisons for which steroid type was available, deflazacort was more commonly used in these RWD/NHD sources than in the corresponding trials.

### Efficacy and safety of deflazacort vs prednisone and placebo for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^116yoZTG]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The efficacy of daily DFZ and PRED for boys with DMD has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, showing benefit of both to muscle strength. The 0.9 mg/kg/d dose of deflazacort was chosen based on data demonstrating that the potency of prednisone to deflazacort was 1:1.2. Previous studies had determined PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d to be effective while minimizing side effects over a 1.5 mg/kg/d dose. No such study had been completed for DFZ when this study was conducted. Thus 2 dose arms of 0.9 mg/kg/d and 1.2 mg/kg/d were studied to accomplish the same goal. The current study showed that both DFZ and PRED were superior to placebo over 12 weeks in improving motor strength, consistent with published literature. In addition to preservation of muscle strength, there was improvement in functional measures of time to rise from supine to standing, climbing 4 stairs, and running or walking 30 feet. However, since similar efficacy was seen between the DFZ groups with lower numerical incidence of AEs overall, the 0.9 mg/kg/d group was the proposed dose submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.

The AEs observed in the present trial are consistent with known AEs associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy. In general, AEs were higher and more severe with PRED than DFZ, most notably regarding weight gain. The higher incidence of weight gain–related AEs with PRED vs DFZ was consistent with the weight and BMI data that demonstrated significant weight gain with PRED over placebo at 12 weeks and PRED over DFZ at 52 weeks. Most comparative studies with PRED and DFZ have demonstrated more weight gain with PRED than DFZ; however, not all studies have noted a difference between these treatments in terms of patient weight gain. Over 1 year, PRED-treated participants gained 18% of their body weight compared with 5% for DFZ-treated participants. Similarly, a recent Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group publication, which demonstrated the loss of ambulation benefit with DFZ over PRED, found no difference in weight gain between DFZ and PRED but PRED-treated participants were on significantly less of the recommended dose compared to DFZ.

### Deflazacort versus prednisone / prednisolone for maintaining motor function and delaying loss of ambulation: a post HOC analysis from the ACT DMD trial [^1176aUjg]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Other adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy in DMD clinical trials include behavioral abnormalities, cushingoid appearance, excessive hair growth, and cataracts. 6, 7 Deflazacort has been associated with a lower incidence of these events, with the exception of cataracts. 6 None of these events were reported for patients in the placebo arm of the ACT DMD trial.

This analysis has several limitations, including its post hoc nature and the fact that the ACT DMD trial was not powered to detect specific treatment differences in these subgroups of the placebo arm. For rare diseases, retrospective analyses can provide insights and contribute to the body of data on medical interventions. Because deflazacort was not commercially available in the United States until 2017, 27 a potential confounder of this post hoc analysis is that in the United States, patients with DMD who were treated with deflazacort could have been from families of high socioeconomic means and may have been receiving better supportive care, which may have affected the outcomes of this analysis. However, of the 230 total patients in ACT DMD, 162 were from outside the United States (70.4%). The placebo arm, which was the source of the data for this post hoc analysis, had 115 total patients in the as‐treated population. Eighty‐three of the 115 total patients in the placebo arm were from outside the United States, (72.2%), with 37 of the 83 treated with deflazacort while 46 received prednisone. Only 32 patients of the 115 total patients were from the United States, with 16 of the 32 treated with deflazacort while the remaining 16 patients were treated with prednisone. The treatment benefits observed in patients who received deflazacort in this study are, therefore, not likely attributable to socioeconomic status, as most of the study subjects were from outside the United States, where deflazacort was and remains readily available as a generic drug. Additionally, the inclusion criterion of a 6MWD ≤ 80% of predicted for the ACT DMD trial made it possible to enroll patients with a wide range of disease severity, which is representative of patients in the real world. As mentioned previously, the baseline characteristics of the patients from the deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone groups were comparable.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^116TuujU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disabling neuromuscular X-linked recessive disorder that affects about 1:3500–1:5000 boys worldwide. DMD arises from a mutation in the dystrophin gene that results in a deficiency of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The loss of functional dystrophin results in inflammation and progressive replacement of muscle fibers with fat and connective tissue, causing gradual and irreversible loss of muscle function.

Patients with DMD typically lose the ability to walk by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens, and, eventually, die due to heart and/or respiratory failure with a median survival time of 30 years. Moreover, approximately one third of these patients present with behavioral and cognitive impairments including intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.

The corticosteroids prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are the current standard of care for treating DMD and prolong reduction in muscle strength and the time before loss of ambulation and mortality in DMD patients. While both prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are used to treat patients with DMD, only deflazacort is FDA approved for this purpose. Evidence from randomized clinical trials indicated that corticosteroids improve muscle function in DMD, delaying the time to loss of ambulation relative to no treatment with corticosteroids. In subsequent studies, corticosteroid use in non-ambulatory patients with DMD was associated with delayed progression of pulmonary, cardiac, and upper limb loss of function when compared with those who did not receive corticosteroids. Deflazacort is administered as a prodrug that forms the active metabolite 21-des deflazacort in plasma. Prednisone is also a prodrug, forming the active metabolite prednisolone in the plasma.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^1167ANU3]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Deflazacort did not increase the time the mice spent immobile relative to untreated B10-mdx mice and WT controls. The high dose of prednisolone and all doses of vamorolone increased the immobilization time significantly.

The findings described above are further supported by an additional study (see Study 3 in Materials and Methods) that evaluated behavioral effects in WT mice following daily dosing with prednisolone 15 mg/kg or vamorolone 45 mg/kg for 35 days. After 35 days of treatment, both corticosteroids induced depression-like behavior as measured by the TST (Supplementary Fig. S3b and c). In the CNS of these mice Fkbp5 mRNA and Ddrd4 mRNA levels were increased (Supplementary Fig. S3d and e). Expression of FKBP5 is reported to be GRE regulated, and Drd4 is a reported biomarker of depression.

Comparison of peripheral side effects (endogenous corticosterone, glucose, and bone parameters) in prednisolone-, deflazacort-, and vamorolone-treated B10-mdx mice

To evaluate the similarities and differences of potential side effects of the three corticosteroids, plasma/blood were evaluated ex vivo for their effects on endogenous corticosteroid after 14 days of dosing (Study 1) and glucose levels (Study 1) after 11 days of dosing. Bone formation was measured by evaluating osteocalcin levels in Study 1 after 14 days. Bone density was measured by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) in Study 2 after 4 months.

At all doses tested in Study 1 (11–14 days), the three drugs severely reduced the levels of endogenous corticosterone (the primary mouse endogenous corticosteroid), increased glucose levels, and reduced osteocalcin levels (Fig. 5a–c).

### Efficacy and safety of deflazacort vs prednisone and placebo for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112tuwd3]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disease that affects approximately 1 in 5,000 live male births. The disease presents in boys typically before the age of 5 years. Without treatment, boys require a wheelchair before their teen years due to deterioration of muscle strength. Currently, glucocorticoids (GCs) are the only pharmacologic therapy shown to increase muscle strength among boys with DMD. Corticosteroids prolong independent ambulation, improve pulmonary function, delay the onset of cardiomyopathy, and reduce the incidence of scoliosis. While numerous, well-controlled studies had been conducted on prednisone (PRED) in the DMD population at the time this study was conducted, no such evidence existed for deflazacort (DFZ).

DFZ is a heterocyclic GC prodrug belonging to the class of oxazoline steroids, with demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. Previous studies have suggested that DFZ and PRED are effective and suggest that DFZ may cause less weight gain than PRED. This study examined the efficacy of DFZ vs placebo and compares the efficacy and safety of DFZ with PRED. An abstract of this study was presented. Although the study was completed in 1995, the data are being published now due to the efforts of the authors and Marathon Pharmaceuticals since the original sponsor of the study gave up the rights to the data and compound. Marathon has submitted a New Drug Application in 2016 for US approval of deflazacort for the treatment of DMD.

### Corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a reappraisal [^114FjPWB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most severe form of childhood muscular dystrophies, resulting in early loss of ambulation between the ages of 7 and 13 years and death in the teens and twenties. Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^111c4WPJ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids provide benefit in patients with DMD by reducing inflammation. Most cytokines are regulated by NF-κB, but some other factors are regulated by GRE sites. The three corticosteroids all reduced proinflammatory cytokines produced by cultured primary bone-derived mouse macrophages (i.e. IFN-γ, IL-10, Il-1β, and IL-12) via the NF-κB-dependent pathway, but all three corticosteroids also induced protein regulated by directly binding GREs (i.e. STAT expression).

Corticosteroids impact leukocyte trafficking, causing increases in the levels of neutrophils and decreases in the levels of lymphocytes. Corticosteroids regulate leukocyte migration via changes in adhesion molecules and cytokines, which likely reflects inhibition of NF-κB. Consistent with this known action of these drugs, all three corticosteroids induced an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes.

All three corticosteroids showed efficacy as demonstrated by reductions in CK and cytokines. In a test of muscle strength, improvement with deflazacortrelative to vehicle reached statistical significance. In addition, differences in fibrosis in mice dosed with deflazacort and prednisolone relative to vehicle reached statistical significance.

No clinical studies have been done comparing these 3 corticosteroids side-by-side. Post-hoc evaluation of DMD trials has suggested that long-term treatment with deflazacort is more effective than prednisolone/prednisone. However, the recent trial, FOR DMD, compared deflazacort and prednisone and found no significant differences between prednisolone and deflazacort in young DMD patients who were 4 to 7 years of age. The FOR-DMD study was designed to evaluate the initial treatment effects in these young boys and not the later efficacy of these corticosteroids.

In conclusion, the findings described here indicate that prednisone/prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone have similar safety profiles in the B10-mdx DMD mouse model and are consistent with the known safety and molecular effects of corticosteroids in the clinic. Possibly, the differences between these corticosteroids can be exploited to best treat specific diseases or patients. However, given the limitations in comparing these compounds in preclinical studies, additional work would be needed to better translate these findings to the clinic.

RESULTS

Participants.

A total of 196 participants (figure 1) from 4 centers in the United States and 5 centers in Canada were enrolled in the study (table 1). Most of the participants were white (185 [94.9%]) and all 196 participants were male. Overall mean (SD) participant age was 8.8 (2.89) years; weight, 30.5 (13.8) kg; height, 131 (18) cm; and BMI, 17.1 (3.7) kg/m 2. These characteristics were similar among all treatment groups.

Figure 1
Study schematic and patient disposition

Participants enrolled were initially allocated to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (study phase 1). Participants were treated for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, placebo participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups and all participants were treated until week 52. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all participants who were randomized and had at least 1 postbaseline assessment. The safety population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. AE = adverse event; DFZ = deflazacort; PRED = prednisone.

### Deflazacort (Emflaza) [^113E8fdr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Deflazacort is a corticosteroid prodrug, whose active metabolite, 21-desDFZ, acts through the glucocorticoid receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The precise mechanism by which deflazacort exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with DMD is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

After oral administration in the fasted state, the median Tmaxwith deflazacort tablets or suspension is about 1 hour (range 0.25 to 2 hours).

Food Effect: Co-administration of deflazacort tablets with a high-fat meal reduced Cmaxby about 30% and delayed Tmaxby one hour, relative to administration under fasting conditions, but there was no effect on the overall systemic absorption as measured by AUC. The bioavailability of deflazacort tablets was similar to that of the oral suspension. The administration of deflazacort with food or crushed in applesauce did not affect the absorption and bioavailability of deflazacort.

Distribution

The protein binding of the active metabolite of deflazacort is about 40%.

Elimination

Metabolism

Deflazacort is rapidly converted to the active metabolite 21-desDFZ by esterases after oral administration. 21-desDFZ is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to several other inactive metabolites, including 6β-hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort.

Excretion

Urinary excretion is the predominant route of deflazacort elimination (about 68% of the dose), and the elimination is almost completed by 24 hours post dose. 21-desDFZ accounts for 18% of the eliminated drug in the urine.

### Deflazacort vs prednisone treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a meta-analysis of disease progression rates in recent multicenter clinical trials [^115aj7QU]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several functional attributes and immunological effects that are the basis for the differential efficacy of deflazacort in comparison to prednisone. In a study of corticosteroid alterations of immune response to dystrophin in patients with DMD, Flanigan et al showed that deflazacort has a greater impact on decreasing interferon‐gamma levels than prednisone. 23 This effect on interferon‐gamma leads to multiple immunomodulatory effects, including modulation of JAK–STAT pathways, nuclear factor‐κB levels, cytokine production, T‐cell differentiation, and a shift from a proinflammatory (M1) macrophage phenotype to a phenotype associated with repair and healing (M2, especially M2c). 23, 24, 25, 26 Deflazacort also affects multiple gene expression pathways in DMD, including those involved in the activation of satellite cells, myogenesis, regeneration, adipogenesis, muscle growth, and tissue inflammation. Deflazacort upregulates CDH15, C‐MET, DLK1, FGF2, IGF1R, MYF5, MYF6, MYOD, and PAX7 expression toward normal values, and downregulates CD68, MYH8, and TNF‐α toward normal ranges. 27

In terms of chemical attributes affecting bioavailability, deflazacort is a prednisolone analog with an oxazoline group at carbon 17 and has reduced lipid solubility vs prednisolone. Deflazacort is 40% protein bound and has no affinity for corticosteroid binding globulin (transcortin) and binds to plasma protein and blood cells instead, crossing the blood–brain barrier in very low concentrations in comparison to prednisone and prednisolone. 28 As DMD progresses and the muscle tissue is replaced by fat, more prednisone or prednisolone would be expected to be taken up in the fatty tissues, whereas relatively more deflazacort would be bioavailable to target muscle fibers. This may explain the relative functional preservation in skeletal muscle endpoints with deflazacort. In addition, less deflazacort crosses the blood–brain barrier, which may impart an advantage with regard to behavioral side effects. With the approval and development of additional therapies for DMD, combination therapy with corticosteroids and dystrophin‐producing therapies, such as antisense oligonucleotides (eteplirsen), nonsense mutation read‐through mechanisms (ataluren), and potential other mechanisms, including gene therapies under development, warrants further study, as there is potential for additive benefits from different mechanisms of action.

### Prednisone / prednisolone and deflazacort regimens in the CINRG Duchenne natural history study [^115jG27k]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to perform an observational study of age at loss of independent ambulation (LoA) and side-effect profiles associated with different glucocorticoid corticosteroid (GC) regimens in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Methods

We studied 340 participants in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS). LoA was defined as continuous wheelchair use. Effects of prednisone or prednisolone (PRED)/deflazacort (DFZ), administration frequency, and dose were analyzed by time-varying Cox regression. Side-effect frequencies were compared using χ(2) test.

Results

Participants treated ≥ 1 year while ambulatory (n = 252/340) showed a 3-year median delay in LoA (p < 0.001). Fourteen different regimens were observed. Nondaily treatment was common for PRED (37%) and rare for DFZ (3%). DFZ was associated with later LoA than PRED (hazard ratio 0.294 ± 0.053 vs 0.490 ± 0.08, p = 0.003; 2-year difference in median LoA with daily administration, p < 0.001). Average dose was lower for daily PRED (0.56 mg/kg/d, 75% of recommended) than daily DFZ (0.75 mg/kg/d, 83% of recommended, p < 0.001). DFZ showed higher frequencies of growth delay (p < 0.001), cushingoid appearance (p = 0.002), and cataracts (p < 0.001), but not weight gain.

Conclusions

Use of DFZ was associated with later LoA and increased frequency of side effects. Differences in standards of care and dosing complicate interpretation of this finding, but stratification by PRED/DFZ might be considered in clinical trials. This study emphasizes the necessity of a randomized, blinded trial of GC regimens in DMD.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that GCs are effective in delaying LoA in patients with DMD.

### Effect of deflazacort on pregnancy outcome in kidney transplant patients: should we change the immunosuppressant before conception? [^111SUTXr]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 40 cases in 36 kidney transplant women were included in this study: 10 cases who had never been pregnant, 9 cases with miscarriage, and 21 cases with clinical pregnancy. One patient in the fertile group had three miscarriages. Two other patients in the fertile group each had one delivery and one miscarriage. Among the infertile women, 12 and 6 women had primary and secondary infertility, respectively. Of these women, 11 had an unexplained cause for infertility, 2 had infertility due to male factor, 4 had decreased ovarian reserve, and 1 had severe endometriosis (retaining duplicate causes). In the infertile group, 2, 4, and 12 women attempted pregnancy through natural conception, IUI, and IVF-ET, respectively. All women in the fertile group conceived naturally. Twenty-one cases of clinical pregnancy were achieved through natural conception in 15 women, IUI in 2 women, and IVF-ET in 2 women. The mean age of all participants was 33.8 ± 3.4 years. Mean duration of attempted conception was 17.6 ± 18.2 months and average time interval from the time of kidney transplant to the time they tried conceiving was 5.9 ± 4.1 years.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^116sJX72]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Doses of vamorolone used in the current studies were based on doses previously reported as effective in the mdx mouse model. The dose of vamorolone required to see efficacy in the mouse results in a higher exposure than does the exposure associated with efficacy in the clinic. Specifically, the dosing of vamorolone at 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg resulted in 2–4-fold higher exposure in the mouse (based on C max) than the human clinical exposure following a 6 mg/kg/day dosing (Supplementary Table S3). A dose of 4 to 5 mg/kg would be predicted to have similar exposure in the mouse as clinical 6 mg/kg/day dose. However, published data reported that administration of vamorolone at 5 mg/kg in the mdx mouse showed little activity. Similarly, in our studies, we also saw limited activity at 15 mg/kg and hence did not include lower doses in our experiments that would more closely match the PK AUC of the 6 mg/kg clinical dose. At a dose of 15 mg/kg vamorolone, limited biological activity was noted and defined by the decrease in lymphocytes or the increase in neutrophils after 2 weeks of dosing (Supplementary Table S4). For deflazacort and prednisolone/prednisone, doses of approximately 5 mg/kg in the mouse resulted in similar exposures as the human clinical dose of 0.9 and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). The dose of prednisolone in these studies used may have resulted in greater biological activity systemically in the mouse, as the lowest dose of prednisolone resulted in similar changes in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as the highest doses of deflazacort and vamorolone. The difference between vamorolone exposures associated with efficacy in mice and humans may reflect differences in the PK profile (shape of the PK curve) or differences in binding of the corticosteroid to the mouse compared with the human glucocorticoid receptor. These differences may influence the efficacy/side effect ratio across species making direct translation from the mouse to the human difficult.

Adverse events with low-dose GCs

The concerns about side effects associated with GCs have prompted substantial efforts to improve safety profiles without compromising efficacy. Several alternative strategies have been tested in an effort to achieve this highly desirable goal.

GCs with altered structural characteristics aimed at decreasing the risk for adverse events have been evaluated in patients with RA. Deflazacort, an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity, first became available in 1969. The severity of steroid-induced osteoporosis and growth retardation due to deflazacort is less than that associated with other steroids. Multiple randomized clinical trials appeared to indicate that deflazacort had less severe side effects than conventional GCs, but the dose to achieve and maintain equivalent anti-inflammatory efficacy was usually higher than predicted. At these higher doses, the safety advantages of deflazacort were minimized. It is also important to note that the bone-sparing effects of agents used to treat RA have generally been evaluated in small-scale, short-term studies. Well-designed long-term, large-scale trials are needed to address this issue.

Selective GC receptor agonists (SEGRAs) represent another approach to modification of the steroid molecule with the aim of improving safety. The classical genomic mechanism of GC action involves transrepression, which has been suggested to be primarily responsible for a large number of the desirable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects of these drugs, and transactivation, which is suggested to be more closely associated with side effects as well as with some immunosuppressive activities. This understanding has prompted the development of SEGRAs aimed at retaining the benefits of conventional GCs while decreasing their adverse effects. To our knowledge, SEGRAs have not yet been evaluated in patients with RA.

So-called soft drug approaches have been used to design new drugs by attempting to alter molecules in order to impact their activity, as well as the most desired way for deactivation and detoxification. This approach has been used for GCs with the molecule loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol has been shown to be as effective as dexamethasone when injected directly into the joint of rabbits with experimentally induced arthritis. Agents in this class have not yet been evaluated in patients with RA.
