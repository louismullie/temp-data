## Question

How should a potassium level of 5.2 be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a serum potassium of 5.2 mmol/L and what steps are appropriate now versus later. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the severity and whether 5.2 mmol/L warrants urgent treatment. Then, I should verify red flags such as symptoms and ECG changes that would override the number. Next, I will check for pseudohyperkalemia and confirm the result, review medications and kidney function to identify causes, implement conservative measures and monitoring, consider thresholds for initiating potassium-lowering therapy, stratify guidance by clinical populations like CKD, HF, or dialysis, and finally define clear escalation criteria and communication points for follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of 5.2 mmol/L: this falls into mild hyperkalemia by common definitions (> 5.0 mmol/L), sits below typical outpatient treatment thresholds (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), and is far from the severe range (≥ 6.0 to ≥ 6.5 mmol/L depending on schema), so immediate emergency therapy is not indicated if the patient is asymptomatic and the ECG is normal [^113hTA5U] [^113YXfBL] [^1172XMC2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even a mild number can be dangerous in the wrong context, so I should screen quickly for red flags: new muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, palpitations, or paresthesias, and I should check for hyperkalemic ECG changes such as peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR prolongation, or QRS widening that would trigger urgent treatment with membrane stabilization and intracellular shifting, keeping in mind that ECG findings are inconsistent and should not be the sole determinant of urgency [^113hTA5U] [^115Gqbhv] [^1148w6NC] [^116DJ3Gh].

> Next, I should review why potassium is elevated to guide targeted interventions: I need to check for drugs that raise potassium such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone or eplerenone, finerenone, NSAIDs, and potassium supplements, then I should confirm kidney function and eGFR since CKD is the dominant risk, and I must consider diabetes with possible hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and the heart failure context where high-normal potassium may coexist with RAAS inhibition benefits; I should also consider acute contributors like uncontrolled hyperglycemia or acidosis, dehydration, and tissue breakdown, and I need to remember that in HF or proteinuric CKD the emerging guidance is to avoid reflex discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors and instead mitigate hyperkalemia risks while preserving cardiorenal benefit [^113YXfBL] [^113BaoYt] [^113Mh4B2] [^112D33Aa] [^116MgUnZ] [^11415M5d].

> Wait, let me verify the accuracy of the laboratory value before I act: I should repeat serum potassium to confirm it is not a spurious elevation, review the sample for hemolysis, consider point-of-care whole blood potassium if results are urgently needed, and in the setting of extreme leukocytosis or thrombocytosis I should suspect pseudohyperkalemia and consider a venous whole-blood potassium to avoid overtreatment; for unexpected mild elevations, a short-interval retest is reasonable, with UKKA recommending within 3 days for 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, which supports prompt repeat at 5.2 mmol/L if the clinical context is unclear [^111t4bJ8] [^114AFj3b] [^117QSbyY].

> I will now implement initial conservative management since 5.2 mmol/L is below treatment thresholds: let me consider medication review and dose optimization rather than abrupt discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors when they are indicated, optimize glycemic control and address metabolic acidosis when present, and address bowel habits; I initially wrote "treat constipation (reduces colonic potassium excretion)", but wait, that parenthetical is backwards — constipation reduces colonic potassium excretion and treating constipation may increase colonic potassium elimination and help lower serum potassium, so I should correct that statement accordingly, and I will also provide nuanced dietary counseling that prioritizes reducing non-plant potassium sources instead of broad restriction, recognizing limited evidence for strict restriction and the cardiometabolic benefits of plant-forward diets [^11415M5d].

> Let me think about when to add potassium-lowering therapy: I should confirm persistence and trend, and if potassium is repeatedly ≥ 5.5 mmol/L or if high-risk features accumulate, I will consider outpatient potassium binders such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to maintain normokalemia and preserve RAAS inhibitors, noting their safety profiles and evidence base; diuretics are reasonable if there is volume overload and sufficient kidney function, and sodium bicarbonate can be considered when significant metabolic acidosis coexists though its effect is variable [^113YXfBL] [^113hWL5V] [^112gwP15] [^112eLX7o] [^111vYKXD].

> I should confirm an appropriate monitoring cadence: for this mild value I will repeat potassium within 1–3 days if the clinical context is uncertain or modifiable factors were changed, then recheck every 2–4 weeks until stable, and for at-risk patients such as CKD, HF, or diabetes I will align long-term surveillance to roughly 2–4 times per year; routine ECG monitoring is not necessary at 5.2 mmol/L if asymptomatic, but I will escalate to ECG if symptoms develop or the level rises toward 6.0 mmol/L [^111t4bJ8] [^116NkTYS] [^113hTA5U].

> Now, let me stratify by patient population because targets and tolerance differ: in non-dialysis CKD, I can accept up to 5.5 mmol/L if stable and asymptomatic while favoring binders to preserve RAAS inhibition; in heart failure, outcomes appear favorable in the high-normal range but 5.2 mmol/L is slightly above that and calls for optimization rather than abrupt drug withdrawal; in hemodialysis, a pre-dialysis 5.2 mmol/L sits within the usual 4.0–6.0 mmol/L target, and adjustments should be individualized including dialysate potassium only if upward trends persist; in the general population without CKD or HF, 5.2 mmol/L is often transient or medication-related and should trigger retesting and targeted adjustments [^116EoAM1] [^111cZZL1] [^113DtGn3].

> But wait, what if the number climbs or the context changes; I should define clear escalation criteria: if potassium remains between 5.2 and 5.4 mmol/L I will continue monitoring and address reversible drivers, if it is persistently ≥ 5.5 mmol/L I will initiate binder therapy and intensify risk mitigation, if it reaches ≥ 6.0 mmol/L I will arrange urgent evaluation and consider acute shifting therapies, and if it is ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or there are ECG changes or symptoms at any level I will arrange immediate emergency treatment and consider admission per UKKA guidance [^113YXfBL] [^111rrGqp] [^115Gqbhv].

> I should double-check that the plan is documented and communicated: I will record the baseline value, suspected contributors, medications, renal function, and the retesting schedule, counsel the patient that 5.2 mmol/L is mild and typically not dangerous but warrants follow-up, instruct them to avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes, and ask them to report muscle weakness or palpitations promptly, coordinating with nephrology or cardiology when CKD or HF is present [^113hTA5U] [^116NkTYS].

> Finally, let me summarize the practical steps so nothing is missed: confirm no hemolysis and repeat potassium within 1–3 days, screen for symptoms and obtain an ECG if indicated, review medications and kidney function, optimize reversible drivers such as glycemia, acidosis, and bowel habits, do not initiate acute potassium-lowering therapies at 5.2 mmol/L, preserve RAAS inhibitors when indicated while mitigating risk, monitor closely and consider binders if potassium persists ≥ 5.5 mmol/L or risk is high, and escalate urgently if potassium approaches or exceeds 6.0 mmol/L or symptoms or ECG changes emerge [^113YXfBL] [^116NkTYS] [^11415M5d].

---

A potassium level of 5.2 mmol/L represents **mild hyperkalemia** and typically does not require urgent treatment [^113hTA5U] [^113YXfBL]. First, **confirm the result** by repeating the test to exclude pseudohyperkalemia [^117QSbyY], and check for ECG changes or symptoms. If the repeat is normal, **no action is needed**. If confirmed, review and stop potassium-raising drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs) [^113hTA5U], and consider a low-potassium diet if it persists [^notfound]. Recheck potassium within 1–2 weeks and treat only if levels rise or symptoms develop.

---

## Confirm the laboratory result

repeat testing is essential because mild elevations often reflect **pseudohyperkalemia** from hemolysis, prolonged tourniquet use, or delayed processing; repeat the test promptly to confirm, and ensure proper **sample handling** to minimize hemolysis and processing delays [^117QSbyY].

---

## Clinical assessment

Evaluate **symptoms** — most patients with mild hyperkalemia are asymptomatic, but assess for muscle weakness, paresthesias, or palpitations if present [^113hTA5U] — and obtain an **ECG** to check for peaked T waves, PR prolongation, or QRS widening, which are uncommon at 5.2 mmol/L [^1179Cqu6].

---

## Identify and address underlying causes

- **Medications**: Review and stop or adjust potassium-raising drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, potassium supplements) [^116LxTm8] [^115ZVoGL].

- **Renal function**: Evaluate for CKD or AKI, as impaired excretion is a common cause [^113hTA5U].

- **Other causes**: Consider adrenal insufficiency, acidosis, or hemolysis if clinically indicated [^116MgUnZ].

---

## Management strategy

### Immediate actions

If the repeat is normal, **no further action is needed** [^113hTA5U]; if confirmed, **no urgent treatment is required** — proceed with monitoring and risk reduction [^113YXfBL].

---

### Monitoring

Recheck **serum potassium** within 1–2 weeks, or sooner if risk factors or symptoms develop [^113YChVW]; **high-risk patients** (those with CKD, heart failure, or diabetes) should be monitored more frequently [^116NkTYS].

---

### Dietary modifications

Consider a **low-potassium diet** if hyperkalemia persists after addressing other causes [^116EoAM1].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

There is **no urgent therapy** indicated [^113YXfBL]. Do not use insulin, beta-agonists, or IV calcium at this level unless ECG changes or symptoms occur; **potassium binders** are not indicated at 5.2 mmol/L — consider them only if levels rise or persist despite other measures [^115Gqbhv] [^112gwP15].

---

## Indications for urgent treatment

Urgent treatment is indicated if any of the following occur:

- **Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L** or a rapid rise.

- **ECG changes**, such as peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening [^115Gqbhv].

- **Clinical symptoms**, such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or arrhythmias [^111ncDVe].

- **Severe renal impairment** or **ongoing potassium release** (e.g. rhabdomyolysis) [^113hTA5U].

---

## Prognosis and risks

Mild hyperkalemia is generally low risk if managed appropriately, whereas **persistent elevation** is associated with increased mortality, especially in CKD or heart failure [^116ABgiW].

---

## Summary table: management of potassium 5.2 mmol/L

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| Confirm | Repeat test to exclude pseudohyperkalemia |
| Assess | Check symptoms and ECG |
| Identify | Review medications and renal function |
| Monitor | Recheck potassium in 1–2 weeks |
| Diet | Consider low-potassium diet if persistent |
| Treat | No urgent therapy unless ECG changes or symptoms |

---

A potassium level of 5.2 mmol/L represents mild hyperkalemia: confirm the result, assess for symptoms or ECG changes, address reversible causes, and monitor. No **urgent treatment** is needed unless potassium rises, ECG changes appear, or symptoms develop [^113hTA5U].

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED) and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

- **Objective**: This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

- **Discussion**: In the ED, interventions aimed at protecting patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shifts from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal routes. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk…

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^113gJdZZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**: If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes (including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium), electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

- **Administration**: Dilute the potassium chloride for oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Take with meals or immediately after eating.

- **Adult dosing**: For treatment of hypokalemia, the daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq, given in 2 to 5 divided doses, with a limit of 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period. For maintenance or prophylaxis, the typical dose is 20 mEq per day, individualized based on serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit.

### Hyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis: Should you treat [^117QSbyY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia is a common and life-threatening problem presenting to the emergency department. Rapid correction of the electrolyte abnormality is essential; however, doing so can be detrimental in circumstances where delaying treatment for confirmation is necessary. Our case exemplifies one of those scenarios: pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis.

- **Case**: An elderly woman with long-standing but untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a left hip fracture. She was found to have a potassium level of 8.4 mEq/L without symptoms of hyperkalemia, renal disease, or EKG findings. Her white blood cell count was 444 K/uL. Despite a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, correction was deferred pending confirmation by venous whole blood, which revealed a normal potassium level.

- **Discussion**: Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of severe leukocytosis. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize this phenomenon and avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon and the methods for correct analysis are presented here.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depend on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content.

Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy, and correcting metabolic acidosis if present.

The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of non-plant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintenance.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g. due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^111ziYaz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

An unresolved issue in potassium management for haemodialysis patients is whether predialysis hyperkalaemia or a high dialysate–serum potassium gradient presents a more significant risk for adverse outcomes (Figure 1). Internationally, the concentration of dialysate potassium varies, with some countries predominantly utilizing concentrations of 1–2 mmol/L, while others use 3–4 mmol/L.

Pun and Middleton reviewed nine retrospective studies analyzing the association between dialysate potassium concentration and outcomes such as sudden cardiac death or all-cause mortality. Of these, five studies indicated increased adverse outcomes with lower dialysate potassium (< 2 or < 3 mmol/L). Two studies found no association, whereas the remaining two studies suggested benefits with lower dialysate potassium.

Mercadal et al. utilized sales data to show a decline in the use of lower dialysate potassium levels over time: usage of < 2 mmol/L decreased from 57% to 49%, while 3 mmol/L and ≥ 4 mmol/L increased from 89% to 91% and from 3% to 13%, respectively. This trend corresponds with recent literature associating low dialysate potassium with increased adverse outcomes. However, the findings are not universal, as occasional use of dialysate potassium < 2 mmol/L was associated with lower mortality compared to no use. The heterogeneity in results suggests the complexity of selecting an ideal dialysate potassium concentration.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^115Gqbhv]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyperkalemia, especially concerning intravenous calcium, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend administering IV calcium (equivalent dose of 6.8 mmol) in patients with hyperkalemia who exhibit ECG changes. The recommended dose and rate are 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 minutes or 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride over 5 minutes, guided by the clinical setting.

### Disorders of potassium [^114RnHW7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in serum potassium are commonly encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. A variety of acute and chronic causes can lead to life-threatening illness in both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia. Here, we summarize the relevant causes, risks, and treatment options for these frequently encountered disorders.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder, requiring clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. This case highlights key physiological mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. Specific mechanisms of action for available treatments of hyperkalemia are discussed in this context.

### Inspra [^113BaoYt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria, or those taking ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at an increased risk for hyperkalemia. It is crucial to monitor serum potassium levels and adjust doses as needed [see Dosage and administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse reactions (6.2), and Drug interactions (7)].

- **Hyperkalemia**: The risk of hyperkalemia is heightened in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes, and in those concomitantly treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. To minimize this risk, ensure proper patient selection and monitoring. Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of Inspra is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue Inspra therapy with appropriate dose adjustment, as dose reduction can decrease potassium levels. When moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of eplerenone accordingly [see Drug interactions (7.2)].

### Potassium chloride [^114Mbv4L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**: Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes — including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium — electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

- **Administration**: Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water. Take with meals or immediately after eating. If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

- **Adult dosing**: For the treatment of hypokalemia, the daily dose range is from 40 to 100 mEq. Administer in 2 to 5 divided doses, limiting doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

	- **Maintenance or prophylaxis**: The typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize the dose based on serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium**: We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. We suggest choosing dialysate potassium levels between 1.0 and 3.0 mmol/L for the majority of patients, employing an individualized approach, generally using the highest dialysate potassium that controls pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. Additionally, we propose a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and using other measures such as dietary advice, medication review, and increased dialysis frequency.

- **Rationale**: Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium levels between zero and 2 mmol/L were common. The need for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units, dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate. Zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium levels between 1 and 4 mmol/L. The removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium, with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This fluctuation likely contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period and at the end of the weekend gap.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^1156gGZL]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly concerning patients on hemodialysis, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating standard medical therapies to lower serum potassium in hemodialysis patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) if dialysis is not immediately available.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^115B7JKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

- **Key learning points**: Severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a higher risk of short-term adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce. We conducted a retrospective observational study that evaluated the long-term trajectory of potassium and risk of mortality in patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia (K > 6 mEq/L).

- **What this study adds**: Severe hyperkalaemia may occur in patients who did not have chronic kidney disease (25% of our patients). After developing severe hyperkalaemia, re-hyperkalaemia is a frequent finding, especially during the first 6 months after discharge. Following an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode, potassium trajectories predict the risk of death. During the post-discharge follow-up, transitioning from normal to higher potassium levels or persisting high values was associated with a higher risk of death.

- **What impact this may have on practice or policy**: This study strengthens the importance of close clinical and potassium monitoring after an episode of acute hyperkalaemia. It reinforces the fact that new and well-tolerated treatments after discharge from a hyperkalaemia-related hospitalization should be strongly considered.

### Potassium chloride [^111WdaJ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**:

- **Monitoring**: Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For the treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels on a monthly to biannual basis for maintenance or prophylaxis. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes (including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium), electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

- **Administration**: Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Take with meals or immediately after eating. If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

- **Adult dosing**:

- **Treatment of hypokalemia**: The daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Administer in 2 to 5 divided doses, with a dose limit of 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

- **Maintenance or prophylaxis**: A typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize the dose based on serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113DtGn3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Considerations for patients receiving dialysis: Patients on dialysis form a special group for two reasons. The first reason is the prevalence of hyperkalemia, indicated by pre-dialysis serum [K+] levels exceeding 5.5 mM, in approximately 20% of hemodialysis patients. The second reason is the prevalence of comorbidities such as left ventricular hypertrophy, which might potentiate any risk of cardiac arrhythmia and death.

In patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, hyperkalemia has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, and hospitalization. During hemodialysis, the risks associated with hyperkalemia may be heightened during the long interdialytic gap. An observational study of over 50,000 hemodialysis patients found that hyperkalemia (defined as > 5.5 mM pre-dialysis) correlated with an increased risk of hospitalization within the subsequent 4 days. The risk was highest for [K+] measured on Fridays (before a 3-day gap) compared to measurements taken on Mondays or Wednesdays (before a 2-day gap).

Prescribing behavior in hyperkalemia: The risk of hyperkalemia may deter physicians or patients from choosing certain medications. For example, in a Swedish registry of over 11,000 heart failure patients, only 40% of eligible patients with heart failure were prescribed a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). In a study of more than 80,000 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the 'treatment gap' — defined as the proportion of eligible patients not receiving an MRA — was substantial.

### Potassium chloride [^112iv5Pi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Potassium chloride injection is indicated in the treatment of potassium deficiency states when oral replacement is not feasible. This highly concentrated, ready-to-use potassium chloride injection is intended for the maintenance of serum potassium levels and for potassium supplementation in fluid-restricted patients who cannot accommodate additional volumes of fluid associated with potassium solutions of lower concentration.

When using these products, patients should be on continuous cardiac monitoring and undergo frequent testing for serum potassium concentration and acid-base balance.

### Relation of serum potassium level to long-term outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^111MZtUQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Potassium plays a key role in normal myocardial function. Guidelines recommend that serum potassium levels be maintained from 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the impact of serum potassium levels on long-term mortality has not been evaluated. We retrospectively studied 1,924 patients diagnosed with AMI. The average serum potassium levels measured throughout the hospitalization were obtained and statistically analyzed.

- **Patient categorization and analysis**: Patients were categorized into five groups to determine the relation between mean serum potassium and long-term mortality. The mortality risk was higher for patients with potassium levels of 4.5 mEq/L (hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 2.81) and for patients with levels of 4.5 to < 5.0 mEq/L and ≥ 5.0 mEq/L (HR 4.78, 95% CI 2.14 to 10.69), compared to patients with potassium levels of 3.5 to < 4.0 mEq/L. The mortality risk was also higher for patients with potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L (HR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56).

In contrast to the association with long-term mortality, there was no relation between serum potassium levels and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The results of the analysis suggest that there is a need for change in our concepts of the management of patients with AMI regarding potassium level maintenance.

### Serum potassium levels and outcome in patients with chronic heart failure [^112D33Aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Potassium levels are often abnormal in patients with heart failure (HF) and have a detrimental effect on clinical outcomes. We evaluated potassium levels in a real-world cohort of patients with HF and their effect on mortality. All patients with a diagnosis of HF at a health maintenance organization were evaluated and followed for cardiac-related hospitalizations and death. The cohort consisted of 6,073 patients with HF.

Mean potassium levels were 4.57 ± 0.53 mmol/L. Most patients (68%) had potassium levels in the normal range (4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L). High-normal potassium levels (5.0 to 5.5 mmol/L) were present in 17% of the patients, low potassium levels (< 4.0 mmol/L) in 11%, and hyperkalemia (K ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in 4%. The mean follow-up was 576 days. The overall mortality rate during this period was 14%.

Survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that hypokalemia (K ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) was associated with the lowest survival rate. Survival was highest in patients with high-normal potassium levels. Cox regression analysis, after adjustment for significant predictors including co-morbidities and standard HF drug therapies, demonstrated that high-normal potassium levels were independently associated with reduced mortality compared with normal reference levels (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.95, p = 0.01).

Subgroup analysis showed improved outcomes with high-normal potassium levels in patients with reduced renal function, spironolactone, and loop diuretic therapy. In conclusion, potassium levels in the high-normal range appear to be safe and are associated with an improved outcome in patients.

### Altace [^115ZVoGL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hyperkalemia**: In clinical trials with Altace, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving Altace. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Cough**: Presumably caused by inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

### Kerendia [^113Mh4B2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hyperkalemia. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed.

- **Hyperkalemia**: Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

### Dialysate potassium, dialysate magnesium, and hemodialysis risk [^112FxGU3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

One of the fundamental goals of the hemodialysis prescription is to maintain serum potassium levels within a narrow normal range during both the intradialytic and interdialytic intervals. Considering the extraordinarily high rate of cardiovascular mortality in the hemodialysis population, clinicians are obligated to explore whether factors related to dialytic potassium removal can be modified to improve clinical outcomes. Observational studies and circumstantial evidence suggest that extreme concentrations of serum and dialysate potassium can trigger cardiac arrest.

In this review, we provide an overview of factors affecting overall potassium balance and factors modulating potassium dialysate fluxes in dialysis. We review data linking serum and dialysate potassium concentrations with arrhythmias, cardiovascular events, and mortality. We explore potential interactions between serum and dialysate magnesium levels and risks associated with dialysate potassium levels. Finally, we conclude with proposed dialytic and novel nondialytic approaches to optimize outcomes related to potassium homeostasis in patients on hemodialysis. Dialysis clinicians need to consider changes in the overall clinical scenario when choosing dialysate potassium concentrations, and an effective change in practice will require more frequent serum potassium monitoring and responsive dialysis care teams.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^112gwP15]. BMC Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

The safety profile of SZC 10 g TID demonstrated in the patient population was generally consistent with that observed in the overall populations who received SZC during the two phase 3 trials. The most common adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients in this analysis were gastrointestinal-related disorders (2.9%), with constipation being the most frequent gastrointestinal AE (1.8%). In the HARMONIZE study, the most common AE was edema, and in the ZS-003 study, the most common AE in both placebo and SZC treatment groups was diarrhea.

The clinical and economic burden of hyperkalemia is well known. In a recent analysis of the cost of hyperkalemia in the United States (N = 39,626 patients with hyperkalemia and an equal number of matched controls), patients with hyperkalemia incurred $4,128 higher 30-day healthcare costs than matched controls ($5,994 vs. $1,866, respectively). A review of 911,698 medical records across the US demonstrated that, in the absence of known cardiovascular disease, diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, mortality was shown to be 7.5-fold higher in individuals with potassium (K +) levels of 5.5–8.0 mmol/L vs. those with K + levels of 4.0– < 5.0 mmol/L. In a cohort study of more than 55,000 patients with chronic kidney disease not undergoing dialysis, serum K + levels of ≥ 6.0 mmol/L were associated with a higher risk of death, major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and discontinuations of RAASi therapy. Elevated K + was the cause of approximately 67,000 visits to US emergency departments during 2011, with 50% of these visits resulting in hospitalization.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health.

- **Hypokalemia**: It is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L.

- **Hyperkalemia**: It is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g. muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release.

- **Modern treatments**: Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, no consensus guidelines exist for the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition.

This review provides a succinct examination of the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, reviews available literature, and discusses practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, it covers the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects.

We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Lokelma [^116NQgnq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients who achieved a potassium level between 3.5 and 5 mEq/L after receiving Lokelma during the acute phase were re-randomized to receive either a once daily placebo or 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of once daily Lokelma for 12 days along with breakfast.

The primary endpoint in the maintenance phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels over the 12-day treatment interval. This compared patients receiving Lokelma with those receiving placebo. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint at the 5 and 10 g doses when compared with their respective placebo groups (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001).

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in approximately 9% of patients admitted for acute HF, and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF.

Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was approximately 16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19,194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) as significant contributing factors.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^113hWL5V]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

No universally accepted standard of care protocol has been established for the treatment of patients presenting with acute hyperkalemia, whether in the ambulatory or emergency room (ER) setting. In a multicenter, prospective, observational analysis (n = 203), the REVEAL-ED study reported that seven therapies (inhaled β2-agonists, i.v. bicarbonate, i.v. calcium, hemodialysis, i.v. diuretics, i.v. insulin/glucose, oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate) were utilized in 43 varying combinations in the 14 emergency departments surveyed.

Oral potassium binders hold particular appeal in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) where diuretics may be less effective, and where dialysis has inherent risks and is costly. For over 50 years, the only available oral potassium binder had been sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, FDA approved in 1958). In recent years, two new agents have been approved by the FDA for chronic management of hyperkalemia: patiromer in 2015 and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) in 2018. At the time of writing, no studies have compared the efficacy of SPS, patiromer, and SZC head-to-head in ER or hospitalized patients with acute hyperkalemia.

### Potassium chloride [^116gXyrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

This highly concentrated, ready-to-use potassium chloride injection is intended for the maintenance of serum potassium (K) levels and for potassium supplementation in fluid-restricted patients who cannot accommodate additional volumes of fluid associated with potassium solutions of lower concentration.

To avoid potassium intoxication, do not infuse these solutions rapidly. Potassium chloride injection should be administered with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as:

- **Severe renal impairment**
- **Acute dehydration**
- **Extensive tissue injury or burns**
- **Cardiac disorders**: Certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block
- **Potassium-aggravated skeletal muscle channelopathies**: Examples include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita, and potassium-aggravated myotonia/paramyotonia

- **Caution with other conditions**: Potassium chloride injection should be administered with caution to patients who are at risk of experiencing hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergo correction of alkalosis. These conditions are associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space. Patients treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause hyperkalemia should also be managed carefully (see Precautions, Drug Interactions).

If used in high-risk patients, close monitoring and careful dose selection and adjustment are required. Patients requiring highly concentrated solutions should be kept on continuous cardiac monitoring and undergo frequent testing for serum potassium and acid-base balance.

### Low dialysate potassium concentration: An overrated risk factor for cardiac arrhythmia [^114VehK9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Serum potassium concentrations rise with dietary potassium intake between dialysis sessions and often reach hyperkalemic levels by the next session. Conversely, potassium concentrations fall during each hemodialysis, sometimes reaching hypokalemic levels by the end. Low potassium dialysate, which rapidly decreases serum potassium and often brings it to hypokalemic levels, is almost universally considered a risk factor for life-threatening arrhythmias. While there is little doubt about the threat of lethal arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia, convincing evidence for the danger of low potassium dialysate and rapid or excessive potassium removal has not been forthcoming.

The original report of more frequent ventricular ectopy in early dialysis, which improved by reducing potassium removal, has received very little confirmation from subsequent studies. Furthermore, the occurrence of ventricular ectopy during dialysis does not appear to predict mortality. Studies relating sudden deaths to low potassium dialysate are countered by studies with more thorough adjustment for markers of poor health. Dialysate potassium concentrations affect the excursions of serum potassium levels above or below the normal range and have the potential to influence dialysis safety.

Controlled studies of different dialysate potassium concentrations and their effect on mortality and cardiac arrests have not been conducted. Until these results become available, I propose interim guidelines for the setting of dialysate potassium levels that may better balance risks and benefits.

### Potassium management with finerenone: Practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia-related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia-related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow-up of 3 years.

### Aldactone [^116LxTm8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Hyperkalemia**: Aldactone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk is increased by impaired renal function or the concomitant use of potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or drugs that enhance potassium levels, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation or titration of Aldactone and regularly thereafter. More frequent monitoring may be necessary when Aldactone is given with other drugs that cause hyperkalemia or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue Aldactone and treat the hyperkalemia.
	- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Excessive diuresis may result in symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, particularly in salt-depleted patients or those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Worsening of renal function may also occur with the concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs). Periodically monitor volume status and renal function.
	- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
	- **Gynecomastia**: Aldactone can cause gynecomastia.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening medical condition characterized by elevated blood potassium levels. The normokalaemic range in adults is considered to be 3.5–5.0 mEq/L, while instances of hyperkalaemia greater than 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for the severity of hyperkalaemia.

- **Severity definitions**: The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut-off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), and severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia to ensure closer monitoring of patients at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), use a more stringent outcome-associated definition: mild (> 5.5 mEq/L), moderate (> 6.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 6.5 mEq/L).

Most individuals with hyperkalaemia, particularly those with mild cases, are asymptomatic. However, when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non-specific. If left untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Patiromer induces rapid and sustained potassium lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia [^111H2DwL]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Mean (s.e.) and median (25%, 75%) serum potassium at the time of the last patiromer dose (34 h) were 5.28 (0.06) and 5.37 (5.00, 5.60) mEq/L, respectively, and continued to decline with significant (P < 0.001) mean reductions from baseline observed from the last dose to the 38-, 41-, 44-, and 48-hour time points.

At 58 h (24 h after the last dose), the mean and median serum potassium were 5.27 (0.11) and 5.40 (5.10, 5.60), respectively, and the mean was not significantly different from the level at the time of the last patiromer dose (34 h).

Five days after the first dose (~86 h after the last dose), mean (s.e.) serum potassium increased significantly from 34 h by 0.27 (0.05) mEq/L (95% CI = 0.17, 0.36) to 5.55 (0.05) mEq/L, and the median serum potassium increased to 5.60 (5.40, 5.70) mEq/L.

Eight days after the first dose (~158 h after the last dose), mean serum potassium increased significantly from 34 h by 0.48 (0.05) mEq/L (95% CI = 0.38, 0.58) to 5.76 (0.05) mEq/L, and the median serum potassium increased to 5.80 (5.60, 5.90) mEq/L.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^115y17UY]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

In the setting of normal kidney function, serum potassium (K+) is maintained within a tight range (3.5–5.3 mEq/L) via renal excretion and cellular redistribution. Hyperkalemia is considered severe if K+ is ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, with or without symptomatic muscle weakness/paralysis or electrocardiogram changes. Severe hyperkalemia occurs in up to 10% of all hospitalized patients and is an independent predictor of increased mortality. It is associated with prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and a 30-day hospital readmission rate of 14.21% compared to 9.86% in non-hyperkalemic patients.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for hyperkalemia include chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and the use of certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Historically, discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors occurred in approximately 75% of cases in response to drug-induced hyperkalemia, potentially leaving patients vulnerable to adverse cardiovascular events.

The emergence of the newer oral potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), has allowed the maintenance of normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. However, there is a lack of data on the potential utility of these binders for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pooled analysis [^113JwUf2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization, leading to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is crucial, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia, and diabetes is an independent risk factor for this condition. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia is estimated at 4%, whereas in the general population, it is estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For instance, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system — such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) — increase this risk.

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormalities identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder observed with greater frequency in patients with renal disease and heart failure, as well as in those using certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that specific levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypical presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations between hyperkalemia and both morbidity and mortality. However, these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and differing clinical presentations.

Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and the degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked, yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia in determining patient outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Potassium citrate extended release [^115T21t4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Hyperkalemia**: In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, potassium citrate administration can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium citrate in patients with chronic renal failure, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion such as severe myocardial damage or heart failure, should be avoided. Closely monitor for signs of hyperkalemia with periodic blood tests and ECGs.

	- **Gastrointestinal lesions**: If there is severe vomiting, abdominal pain, or gastrointestinal bleeding, potassium citrate should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of bowel perforation or obstruction investigated. Solid dosage forms of potassium chlorides have produced stenotic and/or ulcerative lesions of the small bowel and deaths. These lesions are caused by a high local concentration of potassium ions in the region of the dissolving tablets, which injured the bowel. In addition, perhaps because wax-matrix preparations are not enteric-coated and release some of their potassium content quickly, the risk of gastrointestinal lesions increases.

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and gastrointestinal systems, along with shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces, cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes.

Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with intravenous calcium, insulin, and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexalate is recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of oral or intravenous repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### Potassium chloride [^117J97En]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Potassium chloride oral solution is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis in patients for whom dietary management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose reduction is insufficient. Potassium chloride is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis in these same patients for whom dietary management alone is inadequate.

### Klor-con [^1143Ma2c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. If serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. Take with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing, or sucking. For the treatment of hypokalemia, doses range from 40 to 100 mEq/day in divided doses, with a limit of 40 mEq per dose. The typical dose for prevention of hypokalemia is 20 mEq per day.

- **Administration and monitoring**: Use intravenous potassium if serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure it remains in the desired range. The treatment of potassium depletion, especially with cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes (including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium), electrocardiograms, and the patient's clinical status. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as needed.

- **Administration specifics**: Take Klor-Con with meals and a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take on an empty stomach due to potential gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing, or sucking.

- **Dosing**: Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Foe or friend [^116VoiFT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Table 2 summarizes the main studies whose aim was to evaluate the effect of potassium-binding agents. An important inclusion criterion of the AMETHYST‐DN phase II study and the OPAL‐HK phase III study was the presence of a serum potassium level above 5.0 mEq/L, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) use. Another patiromer study, PEARL‐HF, was conducted for patients with documented heart failure (HF) and a potassium level of 4.3 to 5.1 mEq/L. Additional inclusion criteria were either a reduction of eGFR to ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² while taking RAASi or documented hyperkalemia that led to the cancellation of RAASi.

- **Key inclusion criteria and results in indicative potassium binder trials**: Both AMETHYST‐DN and OPAL‐HK showed reductions of serum potassium level throughout the study, regardless of whether patients had chronic heart failure, advanced CKD, diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. The treatment period of PEARL‐HF showed a lower incidence of hyperkalemia in the patiromer group compared with the placebo group (7% vs. 25%, respectively). Contrarily, more patiromer-treated patients developed hypokalemia, with a potassium value < 3.5 mEq/L (6% vs. 0%, respectively), and significantly more had a potassium value < 4.0 mEq/L compared with the placebo group (47% and 10%, respectively). That led to an increase in the spironolactone dose in patients treated with patiromer compared with placebo patients (P = 0.019). In another open-label study that included patients with baseline potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, patiromer was effective and generally well-tolerated for hyperkalemia treatment, whether or not patients were taking a RAAS inhibitor.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration and subsequent potassium concentration in hyperkalemia treatment [^111vYKXD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder commonly encountered in the emergency department that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. While sodium bicarbonate is often used for the acute lowering of serum potassium, its efficacy is not well established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the amount of potassium reduction in emergency department patients who received intravenous sodium bicarbonate as part of treatment for hyperkalemia compared with those who did not.

- **Methods**: A retrospective electronic chart review was conducted on adult patients who presented to the emergency department with an initial potassium concentration greater than or equal to 5.4 mMol/L and received intravenous insulin as part of hyperkalemia treatment. Patients who received intravenous sodium bicarbonate in addition to intravenous insulin were included in the sodium bicarbonate group. The control group included patients who did not receive intravenous sodium bicarbonate. The primary objective of this study was to compare the absolute reduction in serum potassium between initial and second concentrations in patients from the sodium bicarbonate group and those in the control group.

- **Results**: A total of 106 patients were included in this study, with 38 patients in the sodium bicarbonate group and 68 patients in the control group. Median initial potassium concentration was 6.6 mMol/L in the sodium bicarbonate group and 6.1 mMol/L in the control group (P = 0.009). Absolute reduction of potassium at first repeat was 1 and 0.9 mMol/L in the sodium bicarbonate group.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration can also be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life-threatening.

Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as the first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L: Pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^112G5b25]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte abnormality associated with poor clinical outcomes, cardiac dysrhythmias, increased mortality, and higher use of healthcare resources. Despite the potential for devastating sequelae, the threshold for and means of treating hyperkalemia vary in clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia therapies, such as intravenous insulin and glucose or inhaled β2 agonists, are typically used in the emergency department and other acute care settings to lower serum potassium (K+) levels. These treatments are temporary and impractical for ongoing outpatient use. Although acute dialysis may be utilized in select patients for the immediate treatment of hyperkalemia, this procedure is invasive, costly, presents logistical challenges, and may require an inpatient admission. While nonspecific cation-exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and patiromer, are suited for the outpatient setting, they have been associated with questionable tolerability or a slow onset of action. Therefore, there remains a need for more reliable treatment options for patients with hyperkalemia that allow for rapid and safe reduction of K+ values.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is an oral, non-absorbed, high-capacity cation-binding compound that selectively exchanges K+ for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract. SZC is thought to start binding potassium in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which most likely accounts for its rapid onset of action (AstraZeneca, unpublished observations). In clinical studies, SZC has demonstrated efficacy and safety in managing hyperkalemia.

### Veltassa [^112eLX7o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Part B primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the earliest visit at which the patient's serum potassium was first outside of the range of 3.8 to 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L. Patients who received an initial dose of 8.4 grams of patiromer per day (as a divided dose) had a mean daily dose of 14 grams. Those with a baseline serum potassium of > 5.5 to < 6.0 mEq/L received an initial dose of 16.8 grams of patiromer per day (as a divided dose), with a mean daily dose of 20 grams during the entire study.

### Dialysate and serum potassium in hemodialysis [^113THDru]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Most patients with end-stage renal disease depend on intermittent hemodialysis to maintain levels of serum potassium and other electrolytes within a normal range. However, one of the challenges has been the safety of using a low-potassium dialysate to achieve that goal, given the concern about the effects that rapid and/or large changes in serum potassium concentrations may have on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia. Additionally, in this patient population, there is a high prevalence of structural cardiac changes and ischemic heart disease, making them even more susceptible to acute arrhythmogenic triggers. This concern is highlighted by the knowledge that about two-thirds of all cardiac deaths in dialysis are due to sudden cardiac death and that sudden cardiac death accounts for 25% of the overall death for end-stage renal disease. Developing new approaches and practice standards for potassium removal during dialysis, as well as understanding other modifiable triggers of sudden cardiac death, such as other electrolyte components of the dialysate (magnesium and calcium), rapid ultrafiltration rates, and safety of a number of medications (i.e. drugs that prolong the QT interval or use of digoxin), are critical in order to decrease the unacceptably high cardiac mortality experienced by hemodialysis-dependent patients.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia and a rational approach to its management.

- **Methods**: This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include a search of MEDLINE and a bibliographic search of textbooks and journal articles.

- **Results and conclusions**: A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Serum potassium levels and mortality in acute myocardial infarction [^112a5MdK]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium levels between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These guidelines are based on small studies that associated low potassium levels with ventricular arrhythmias in the pre-β-blocker and prereperfusion era. Studies examining the relationship between potassium levels and mortality in AMI patients are lacking.

- **Objective**: To determine the relationship between serum potassium levels and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients in the era of β-blocker and reperfusion therapy.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Retrospective cohort study using the Cerner Health Facts database, which included 38,689 patients with biomarker-confirmed AMI admitted to 67 US hospitals between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. All patients had in-hospital serum potassium measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum potassium level (< 3.0, 3.0- < 3.5, 3.5- < 4.0, 4.0- < 4.5, 4.5- < 5.0, 5.0- < 5.5, and ≥ 5.5 mEq/L). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between potassium levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors.

- **Main outcome measures**: All-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.

- **Results**: There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum potassium level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8%; 95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%), mortality was associated with different potassium levels.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings.

Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Management of hyperkalemia: An update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications, especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation due to hyperkalemia represents an undesirable clinical compromise.

The emergence of two new potassium-binding medications for the acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L: Pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^116BLNsA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The study examined patients with serum potassium (K+) levels to determine the efficacy of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.

- **Fig. 2**: Patients with serum potassium (K+) levels (a) ≤ 5.5 mmol/L and (b) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L at various time points. The median time to a serum K+ level of ≤ 5.5 mmol/L in the overall population was 2.0 hours (95% CI, 1.1–2.0). The median time to normalization of serum K+ levels to ≤ 5.0 mmol/L was 21.6 hours (95% CI, 4.1–22.4).

Although patients with higher baseline serum K+ levels experienced longer median times to normalization than patients with lower serum K+ levels, all but one patient with a baseline serum K+ level of > 6.5 mmol/L achieved serum K+ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L within 48 hours (median time [95% CI], 20.6 [2.2–24.3] hours). The median time to achievement of serum K+ level ≤ 5.1 mmol/L is presented in Additional file 4: Table S1.

When examining the time to achievement of i-STAT K+ levels ≤ 5.5, ≤ 5.1, and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, it was found that i-STAT K+ goals were achieved in less time than serum K+ goals (Additional file 5: Table S2).

- **Table 2**: Median time to achievement of serum K+ levels ≤ 5.5 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L in the correction phase.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following:

- **Careful history**: Including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea.
- **Physical examination**: Including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate.
- **Measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes**.

Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels.

Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Serum potassium and adverse outcomes across the range of kidney function: a CKD prognosis consortium meta-analysis [^116ABgiW]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Both hypo- and hyperkalemia can have immediate deleterious physiological effects, and less is known about long-term risks. The objective was to determine the risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and end-stage renal disease associated with potassium levels across the range of kidney function and evaluate for consistency across cohorts in a global consortium.

- **Methods and results**: We performed an individual-level data meta-analysis of 27 international cohorts: 10 general population, 7 high cardiovascular risk, and 10 chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the CKD Prognosis Consortium. We used Cox regression followed by random-effects meta-analysis to assess the relationship between baseline potassium and adverse outcomes, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, overall and across strata of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We included 1,217,986 participants followed up for a mean of 6.9 years. The average age was 55 ± 16 years, average eGFR was 83 ± 23 mL/min/1.73 m², and 17% had moderate-to-severe increased albuminuria levels. The mean baseline potassium was 4.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L. The risk of serum potassium of > 5.5 mmol/L was related to lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. The risk relationship between potassium levels and adverse outcomes was U-shaped, with the lowest risk at serum potassium of 4–4.5 mmol/L. Compared with a reference of 4.2 mmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.29] at 5.5 mmol/L and 1.49 (95% CI 1.26–1.76) at 3.0 mmol/L. Risks were similar by eGFR, albuminuria, and other characteristics across cohorts.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^116EoAM1]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to low-potassium diet, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend offering dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in non-hospitalized patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia, with serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia such as constipation, acidosis, and poorly controlled diabetes. Dietary strategies should also be offered to hospitalized patients with moderate or severe hyperkalemia after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia.
