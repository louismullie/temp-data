## Question

best antibotic oral for cellulitis from insect bite

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best oral antibiotic is for cellulitis following an insect bite. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is true bacterial cellulitis versus a sterile inflammatory bite reaction. Then, I should identify the most likely pathogens in nonpurulent cellulitis after a bite. Next, I will review guideline and trial data to decide if MRSA coverage is needed. After that, I need to select the first-line oral agent and dose, consider duration and follow-up, and finally address special scenarios like purulence or penicillin allergy while double-checking that insect bites do not require unique coverage beyond standard nonpurulent cellulitis recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and not jump to conclusions about infection just because there was a bite; many "infected" bites are actually sterile inflammatory reactions with erythema, warmth, and significant pruritus, and antibiotics are commonly overprescribed in this setting, so I need to ensure there are clear signs of spreading infection or systemic features before treating as cellulitis [^113swjNC].

> Next, I should review likely pathogens; for typical nonpurulent cellulitis the predominant organisms are β-hemolytic streptococci and MSSA, and importantly, an insect bite does not usually introduce exotic pathogens — the breach merely allows resident skin flora to invade, so I should target streptococci first and MSSA second unless there are features suggesting purulence or specific risk factors [^116aZEV3] [^11689GoD] [^112hv8YA] [^1114WZ9H].

> Wait, let me verify whether empiric MRSA coverage helps in nonpurulent cellulitis; the pivotal RCT showed no added benefit of TMP-SMX when combined with cephalexin compared with cephalexin alone in ultrasound-confirmed nonpurulent cellulitis, which reinforces guideline advice not to add routine MRSA-active therapy in this scenario [^1112uFJm] [^116aZEV3].

> I will now examine first-line oral choices; a narrow β-lactam with strong streptococcal and MSSA activity is preferred, so cephalexin dosed 500 mg orally four times daily is appropriate, with antistaphylococcal penicillins like dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin as regional equivalents; amoxicillin alone is less reliable for MSSA, and broader agents like amoxicillin-clavulanate or routine MRSA-active drugs are not advantageous for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis [^116aZEV3] [^11689GoD] [^112hv8YA] [^1112uFJm].

> Hold on, I should verify the exception for purulence; if there is abscess or drainage, incision and drainage is primary and empiric MRSA coverage becomes reasonable while cultures are pending, whereas in outpatients with purulent presentations it is reasonable to prioritize MRSA-active agents and avoid β-hemolytic streptococcal–only regimens until culture data guide narrowing [^114zdKRg] [^1166kUD4] [^111qL5D3].

> Let me consider duration and trajectory; a 5–6 day course is generally sufficient for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis with close follow-up, with IDSA advising at least 5 days and extension if not improved, and I should reassess at 48–72 hours to ensure clinical response and to reconsider alternative diagnoses like pseudocellulitis if progress is lacking [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe] [^116huW1n].

> I should double-check allergy and risk-factor contingencies; for immediate penicillin allergy, clindamycin provides both streptococcal and staphylococcal coverage, while in settings with MRSA risk factors or evolving purulence, I can use TMP-SMX or doxycycline plus a β-lactam for streptococcal coverage, or clindamycin alone if local susceptibility supports it [^115M76PW] [^1166kUD4].

> But wait, what if the "bite" is misclassified and the patient mainly has itch without progressive warmth, tenderness, and spreading erythema; in that case supportive care and antipruritic measures are more appropriate than antibiotics, and I should be cautious to avoid antimicrobial overuse in inflammatory bite reactions [^113swjNC].

> Final recommendation: For uncomplicated, nonpurulent cellulitis following an insect bite, the best oral antibiotic is cephalexin 500 mg by mouth four times daily for 5–7 days, aligning with guidelines that prioritize streptococcal coverage and randomized evidence showing no benefit from routine MRSA coverage in nonpurulent disease; flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin are acceptable regional alternatives, and antibiotics should be reserved for clear infection rather than inflammatory bite reactions [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf] [^1112uFJm] [^113swjNC].

---

For uncomplicated cellulitis from an insect bite, the best oral antibiotic is **cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours for 5–7 days** [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe] because it reliably covers streptococci and MSSA, the usual pathogens [^11689GoD] [^112hv8YA]. If MRSA risk is present [^1166kUD4], add **doxycycline 100 mg twice daily** or **TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets twice daily** [^1112uFJm] to cephalexin, or use clindamycin 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours alone [^115M76PW] [^1166kUD4]. Use amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily if Pasteurella is suspected (e.g. cat bites). Treat for 5–7 days [^111gsSaf], extending to 10–14 days if slow response or severe disease [^116PoWQe] [^114LP8SG].

## Recommended oral antibiotics for cellulitis from insect bites

### First-line therapy (no MRSA risk)

In the absence of MRSA risk, **cephalexin (first-generation cephalosporin) 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days** is recommended [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf]; dicloxacillin (antistaphylococcal penicillin) 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days is an alternative [^116aZEV3]. These agents cover streptococci and MSSA, the typical pathogens in nonpurulent cellulitis from insect bites [^11689GoD] [^1114WZ9H] [^112hv8YA].

---

### MRSA coverage (if risk factors present)

MRSA coverage is indicated for patients with a history of **MRSA**, recent hospitalization, or where community **prevalence exceeds 20%**.

- **Clindamycin**: 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours for 5–7 days (covers MRSA and streptococci) [^1166kUD4].

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days (add amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily to cover streptococci) [^115M76PW].

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily for 5–7 days (add amoxicillin or cephalexin to cover streptococci) [^1166kUD4].

---

### Special considerations (Pasteurella coverage)

Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days** when Pasteurella multocida is suspected (e.g. cat bites).

---

## Duration of therapy

Standard duration is **5–7 days** for uncomplicated cellulitis [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf]; extend to 10–14 days for slow clinical response, severe infection, or immunocompromised hosts [^114Z8V8r].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Clinical improvement is expected within **48–72 hours** [^116zpUYf]; reassess if there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen [^11689GoD]. Follow-up should confirm adherence, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust therapy based on response and any available culture results [^114GHCWS].

## Summary table of recommended oral antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** | **Coverage** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | 500 mg | Every 6 hours | 5–7 days | - Streptococci <br/> - MSSA |
| Dicloxacillin | 500 mg | Every 6 hours | 5–7 days | - Streptococci <br/> - MSSA |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg | Every 6–8 hours | 5–7 days | - MRSA <br/> - Streptococci |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg | Twice daily | 5–7 days | MRSA (add amoxicillin for streptococci) |
| TMP-SMX | 1–2 DS tablets | Twice daily | 5–7 days | MRSA (add amoxicillin or cephalexin for streptococci) |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg | Twice daily | 5–7 days | - Pasteurella <br/> - Streptococci <br/> - MSSA |

---

Cephalexin is the **preferred first-line oral antibiotic** for uncomplicated cellulitis from insect bites, with clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX as alternatives when MRSA coverage is needed [^116aZEV3] [^1112uFJm] [^111PYrVi].

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

- **Objective**: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial conducted in 5 US emergency departments. It involved outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess, who were enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had a soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. The final follow-up was in August 2012.

- **Interventions**: Participants received cephalexin, 500 mg four times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome, determined a priori in the per-protocol group, was clinical cure. This was defined as the absence of clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits, including fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21).

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization. It is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings but can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Typical clinical presentation includes an acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain. However, diagnosing cellulitis can be difficult due to numerous infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens.

The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Appropriate targeted coverage for these pathogens with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, and more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy duration, ACP 2021 guidelines recommend completing a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci in patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. This is particularly advised for patients who are able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### 2018 WSES/SIS-E consensus conference: Recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). An IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin — although clindamycin resistance is now very common — tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or…

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^111Qn923]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

We explored differences among survey respondents in their willingness to adopt cellulitis prevention behaviors, comparing participants who had experienced one episode of cellulitis with participants who had experienced recurrent episodes. Only willingness to take antibiotics daily to prevent cellulitis showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Participants who had experienced two or more episodes of cellulitis reported they were more willing to take antibiotics daily (47%) compared with participants who had only experienced one episode (27%). This was reflected in the qualitative data. Some interviewees with recurrent cellulitis who were already taking low-dose antibiotics appeared happy with this, and those who were already taking several other medications felt that adding something else would not bother them.

"Well, I take quite a lot of medication, so it wouldn't bother me, because it is another tablet, just adding on to that, so it doesn't bother me".

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, and there are several nuances to the care of these patients. The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### The impact of dermatology consultation on diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic use among patients with suspected cellulitis seen at outpatient internal medicine offices: a randomized clinical trial [^116huW1n]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a common and costly problem, often diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Many cutaneous conditions may clinically mimic cellulitis, but little research has been done to assess the magnitude of the problem. The objective of this study was to determine if obtaining dermatology consultations in the outpatient primary care setting could assist in the diagnosis of pseudocellulitic conditions and reduce the rate of unnecessary antibiotic use.

The study was a nonblinded randomized clinical trial of competent adults who were diagnosed with cellulitis by their primary care physicians (PCPs), conducted at outpatient internal medical primary care offices affiliated with a large academic medical center.

- **Interventions**: The intervention involved outpatient dermatology consultation.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were final diagnosis, antibiotic use, and need for hospitalization.

Results showed a total of 29 patients (12 male and 17 female) were enrolled for participation in this trial. Nine patients were randomized to continue with PCP management (control group), and 20 patients were randomized to receive a dermatology consultation (treatment group). Of the 20 patients in the dermatology consultation group, 2 (10%) were diagnosed with cellulitis. In the control group, all 9 patients were diagnosed with cellulitis by PCPs, but dermatologist evaluation determined that 6 (67%) of these patients had pseudocellulitis rather than a true infection. All 9 patients (100%) in the control group were treated for cellulitis with antibiotics compared to 2 patients (10%) in the treatment group.

### Alcaligenes faecalis cellulitis following a dog bite: Case report and literature review [^111ZNrUr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative organism commonly found in the environment and may also be part of the normal fecal flora in humans. Although various infections with this bacterium have been documented in the pediatric population, it has not been previously identified as a pathogen in infections following a dog bite.

A case of a 19-month-old boy is presented, who developed cellulitis secondary to a dog bite that did not respond to oral antibiotic therapy. This condition progressed to worsening fever and swelling, necessitating hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and incision and drainage. The wound culture grew A. faecalis, and its identity was confirmed through recombinant DNA sequence analysis. Although A. faecalis has been identified in cat bite wounds, it has not been cited in the literature before as an infectious agent following a dog bite.

### Cellulitis: Diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area.

There are many other dermatologic diseases which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis, referred to collectively as 'cellulitis', are prevalent bacterial skin infections predominantly affecting the lower extremities. Despite their significant morbidity, evidence supporting different prevention strategies remains ambiguous.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of antibiotic prophylaxis and other preventive measures for recurrent cellulitis episodes in adults over the age of 16.

- **Search methods**: Databases searched up to June 2016 included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. Five trials registry databases were also consulted, along with reference lists from relevant studies and reviews for additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Proceedings from two dermatology conferences and BIOSIS Previews were further explored.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials assessing any therapeutic approach for preventing recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors conducted independent study selection, data extraction, risk of bias evaluations, and analyses. The primary prespecified outcome was cellulitis recurrence during and post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalization, quality of life, antibiotic resistance development, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: Six trials were included, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, averaging between 50 and 70 years of age.

### Low risk of infection in selected human bites treated without antibiotics [^113zD73b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the need for antibiotics in low-risk human bite wounds, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 127 patients presenting with low-risk human bite wounds over 2 years to a 40,000-visit-per-year major academic ED was performed. Low-risk bites penetrated only the epidermis and did not involve hands, feet, skin overlying joints, or cartilaginous structures. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, puncture wounds, immunocompromised status, allergy to penicillin or related compounds, or bites greater than 24 hours old. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a cephalexin/penicillin combination or a placebo. One hundred twenty-five patients completed the study. Infection developed in 1 of 62 patients receiving placebo (1.6%, 95% confidence interval, 0–7.3%). Infection developed in 0 of 63 patients receiving the cephalexin/penicillin combination (0%, 95% CI, 0–4.6%). Antibiotic treatment of some low-risk human bite wounds could be unnecessary. Infection rates appear similar in low-risk human bite wounds whether treated with antibiotics or placebo.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can substantially impact patients. Pain, feeling very unwell, and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one-third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis, lymphoedema, obesity, diabetes, and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly due to the growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by the use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments.

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dry skin.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering one of the following regimens if coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-acquired MRSA is desired:

- **Clindamycin alone**.
- **TMP/SMX**.
- **A tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam, such as amoxicillin**.
- **Linezolid alone**.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^11788AUH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, also known as erysipelas, of the leg is an acute, painful, and potentially serious infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, associated with significant morbidity and health costs. The cost of inpatient admission alone was £96 million in 2009/2010. It is usually due to streptococcal infection. Risk factors for cellulitis of the leg include previous episodes of cellulitis, lymphoedema, toe web maceration, obesity, and diabetes. Many patients experience repeat episodes (30–50%), which can lead to subsequent lymphoedema and ulceration.

Evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further episodes is very limited. Three small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest possible benefits, with 16, 40, and 58 participants, respectively. Some clinical guidelines recommend long-term antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with predisposing conditions; however, such recommendations are largely based on empirical evidence, and clinical opinion is mixed.

Two trials of cellulitis prophylaxis have been initiated by the U.K. Dermatology Clinical Trials Network. PATCH I has recruited to target and is due to report in 2012. It will assess the impact of 12 months of prophylactic phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) in patients with recurrent cellulitis (at least two previous episodes). The PATCH II trial, reported here, assesses whether 6 months of prophylaxis with penicillin V is effective in reducing repeat episodes of cellulitis of the leg in patients who have had one or more episodes.

### Best evidence topic report: Are antibiotics indicated following human bites [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A shortcut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty-nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date, and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority-setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically relevant.

### Randomised controlled trial of intravenous antibiotic treatment for cellulitis at home compared with hospital [^113V7eyn]. BMJ (2005). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of intravenous antibiotic treatment for cellulitis administered at home and in a hospital setting. This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Participants included 200 patients who presented to or were referred to the only emergency department in Christchurch. These patients were considered to require intravenous antibiotic treatment for cellulitis without any contraindications for home care. They were randomly assigned to receive treatment either at home or in the hospital.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was the number of days until no advancement of cellulitis. Secondary measures included days on intravenous and oral antibiotics, days in hospital or in the home care program, complications, degree of functioning and pain, and satisfaction with the site of care.

- **Results**: The two treatment groups did not significantly differ for the primary outcome of days to no advancement of cellulitis, with a mean of 1.50 days (SD 0.11) for home treatment and 1.49 days (SD 0.10) for hospital treatment (mean difference 0.01 days, 95% confidence interval -0.3 to 0.28). Satisfaction was greater among patients treated at home, while other outcome measures showed no significant differences.

- **Conclusions**: The study concluded that treatment of cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics can be safely administered at home. Despite this preference for home treatment, only about one third of patients presenting at the hospital were considered suitable candidates for home treatment.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^114kNGcE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of any of the following agents covering MRSA in hospitalized patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), such as deeper soft tissue infections, surgical or traumatic wound infections, major abscesses, cellulitis, or infected ulcers and burns. This is in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics:

- **IV vancomycin**: Administered as directed by healthcare professionals.
- **IV or PO linezolid 600 mg BID**: Twice daily oral or intravenous administration.
- **IV daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose once daily**: A single intravenous dose daily.
- **IV telavancin 10 mg/kg/dose once daily**: A single intravenous dose daily.
- **IV or PO clindamycin 600 mg TID**: Three times daily oral or intravenous administration.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^116uDnSW]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

- **Method**: This is a quality improvement study in which 10 general practices in England as well as Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021. The mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

- **Results**: A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. GPs still undertook most consultations; most were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3, and common symptoms were redness, itchiness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

- **Conclusions**: Antibiotics are likely to be overused for insect bites.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Empiric outpatient therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, or clindamycin for cellulitis [^114ha5U7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on optimal empiric oral antibiotic treatment for outpatients with cellulitis in areas with a high prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-year retrospective cohort study of outpatients with cellulitis empirically treated at a teaching clinic of a tertiary-care medical center in Hawaii. Patients who received more than one oral antibiotic, were hospitalized, or had no follow-up information were excluded. Treatment success rates for empiric therapy were compared among commonly prescribed antibiotics in our clinic: cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. Risk factors for treatment failure were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Of 544 patients with cellulitis, 405 met the inclusion criteria. The overall treatment success rate of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher than the rate of cephalexin (91% vs 74%; p < 0.001), whereas clindamycin success rates were higher than those of cephalexin in patients who had subsequently culture-confirmed MRSA infections (P = 0.01), had moderately severe cellulitis (P = 0.03), and were obese (P = 0.04). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered in 72 of 117 positive culture specimens (62%). Compliance and adverse drug reaction rates were not significantly different among patients who received these three antibiotics. Factors associated with treatment failure included therapy with an antibiotic that was not active against community-associated MRSA (adjusted odds ratio 4.22; 95%).

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^115ovTke]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Recruitment took place in 20 hospitals between August 2006 and August 2008. Patients were identified either at presentation in secondary care through emergency departments, medical admissions units, medical wards, and outpatient clinics, or retrospectively via discharge coding or poster adverts.

Eligible participants had a diagnosis of cellulitis of the leg within the last 12 weeks (index episode). Cellulitis was defined as a confirmed diagnosis by the recruiting dermatologist. If the patient was not seen by the recruiting clinician during the acute phase, validation of the diagnosis was sought from medical case notes in combination with patient discussion. In this case, the following criteria were met: (i) local warmth and tenderness or acute pain; (ii) unilateral erythema, or asymmetrical erythema with the more severe side having a temporal relationship to the symptoms; and (iii) unilateral oedema. Any doubt over the certainty of the diagnosis was grounds for exclusion.

Patients were excluded from the trial if: (i) they had taken antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of cellulitis within 6 months of the index episode; (ii) it was longer than 12 weeks since the start of treatment for the index episode to the date of the baseline visit; (iii) they had a known allergy to penicillin V; (iv) they had preceding leg ulceration, surgery, or major penetrating trauma because these cases were more likely to be caused by staphylococcal infection, which is not susceptible to penicillin V; (v) the recruiting clinician was unwilling.

### Efficacy of oral beta-lactam versus non-beta-lactam treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis [^113egLwA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Preferred therapy for purulent skin and soft tissue infections is incision and drainage, but many infections cannot be drained. Empiric therapies for these infections are ill-defined in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

- **Methods**: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of outpatients treated for cellulitis was conducted to compare clinical failure rates of oral beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam treatments. Exclusion criteria included purulent infection requiring incision and drainage, complicated skin and soft tissue infection, chronic ulceration, and intravenous antibiotics. Failure rates were compared using logistic regression to adjust for both covariates associated with failure and a propensity score for beta-lactam treatment.

- **Results**: Of 2977 patients, 861 met inclusion criteria and were classified by treatment: beta-lactam (n = 631) or non-beta-lactam therapy (n = 230). Failure rates were 14.7% versus 17.0% (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.31) for beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam therapy, respectively. Failure was associated with age (P = 0.02), acute symptom severity (P = 0.03), animal bites (P = 0.03), Charlson score > 3 (P = 0.02), and histamine-2 receptor antagonist use (P = 0.09). Relative efficacy of beta-lactam therapy was greater after adjustment for factors associated with failure but remained statistically insignificant (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.53–1.24); adjusted including propensity score covariate (OR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.45–1.13). Discontinuation due to adverse effects differed between treatments.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^115x7zLb]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Evidence shows that flucloxacillin prescribing in general practice increases in the summer months, peaking in July. A specialist Insect Bite Group (IBG) within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is considering whether this seasonal effect might be due to increased presentations of insect bites, and if so, whether increased prescribing is appropriate. This IBG is part of the RCGP overdiagnosis special interest group (OD), which is concerned with the inappropriate medicalization of self-limiting illnesses and the overuse of antibiotics. The group includes general practitioners (GPs), educators, and researchers. We used Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies to conduct an initial analysis and assessment of this issue.

Best practices in the management of insect bites are not as clearly defined as those for other infective conditions, such as tonsillitis. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on insect bites and stings state that "most will not require antibiotics" and recommend the use of antihistamines. General practitioner clinicians (GPCs) may refer to related guidance. For example, NICE guidance on impetigo recommends an antiseptic (hydrogen peroxide 1% cream) for well patients with localized non-bullous impetigo and, if not suitable, topical antibiotics. More widespread or severe non-bullous impetigo, and all bullous impetigo, are recommended a course of oral antibiotics, with flucloxacillin as first-line treatment. Finally, NICE provides guidance on erysipelas and cellulitis, which recommends taking a swab from broken skin and drawing around the affected area.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The importance of this study lies in addressing the lack of consensus regarding the optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas. Available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and information on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy remains limited.

The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data were sourced from several databases searched until June 28, 2016, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). Additionally, five trial databases and reference lists of the included studies were reviewed. Further searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

The study selection focused on randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations.

For data extraction and synthesis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were employed. The risk ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. A summary of findings table was created for the primary endpoints, using the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or who were symptom-free or had reduced symptoms at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome included any adverse events.

The results section, however, is truncated and not complete in the original text provided.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116zpUYf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, with increasing frequency and costs reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS), which are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, significant treatment challenges exist, such as the overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties in deciding when to initiate rescue therapy and when to cease treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Additionally, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing knowledge of the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in dealing with the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response is critical due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. Typically, the standard assessment of response in SSTI trials is performed after the end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success post-treatment may often result from natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following nonantibiotic therapy in studies from the preantibiotic and early antibiotic eras. Moreover, two studies published in 1937 comparing antibiotic and ultrafound…

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and…

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114FmLXa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection was achieved through routine telephone follow-up calls from the coordinating centre, conducted every three months during the treatment phase and every six months during the follow-up phase. Participants were asked to complete a study diary to record adverse events and health service resource use. If participants experienced a repeat episode of cellulitis, they were instructed to inform the trial staff immediately. Any repeat episodes not reported were identified during the regular telephone interviews.

Health service resource use was captured using diaries and included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, GP consultations, other prescribed drugs for cellulitis, and time away from normal daily activities.

The primary outcome measure for the trial was the time to the next episode of cellulitis. The next confirmed episode was defined as the first reported episode of cellulitis (in either leg) confirmed by a medical practitioner. The episode was considered to have started on the first day of symptoms reported by the participant. Episodes reported by the participant that resulted in antibiotic treatment but were not confirmed by a medical professional were documented as self-reported cases and included in the sensitivity analysis.

- **Secondary outcome measures**:
	- The proportion of participants with repeat episodes of cellulitis at the end of the treatment phase and at the end of the non-intervention follow-up phase.
	- The number of repeat episodes of cellulitis.
	- The proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration.

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^112AAE7s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were twofold: First, to determine antibiotic choices, routes of administration, and outcomes for children treated as outpatients with uncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center; Second, to assess the number of visits and the time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment.

- **Design**: The study employed a descriptive case-control design.

- **Setting**: It was conducted in a tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center.

- **Methods**: Researchers reviewed medical records of otherwise healthy children aged 1–16 years who presented with uncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a three-year period (January 1, 2001–December 31, 2003). Data extracted included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and microbiology results, as well as management details such as the choice, dose, and route of antibiotics, treatment failures, and time spent in the ED.

- **Interventions**: None were applied.

- **Main results**: A total of 269 patients met the inclusion criteria and their charts were reviewed. Cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed oral antibiotic (n = 105), with treatment failure occurring in 10 cases (8.9%). Cefazolin was the most commonly prescribed intravenous antibiotic (n = 124), with 39 patients receiving cefazolin alone and 85 receiving cefazolin with probenecid. The cefazolin-only group experienced 12 (31%) treatment failures, while the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. Patients in the intravenous group spent more time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and had more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) compared to those in the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^112ktUGx]? Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

This quality improvement study involved 10 general practices in England as well as Wales, investigating patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021. The mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. General practitioners still undertook most consultations; most were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3, and common symptoms were redness, itchiness, pain, and heat.

Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

Antibiotics are likely to be overused in outpatient settings for insect bites, potentially contributing to unnecessary antimicrobial resistance.

### Effectiveness of oritavancin for management of skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department: A case series [^112nXmdk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis, are commonly diagnosed in the emergency department. These patients are often admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Oritavancin is a novel antibiotic approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and is administered as a one-time infusion. While oritavancin has demonstrated comparable efficacy with multi-dose parenteral antibiotics in clinical trials and has been proposed as an alternative to admission for emergency department patients, there is a paucity of available real-world effectiveness data.

In this case series, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of ten patients with high-risk skin and soft tissue infections who received oritavancin and were discharged from the emergency department.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^111BeTXN]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

For identified eligible consultations, the practice clinician extracted data related to the patient (age, sex), presenting problem (bite site, symptoms, duration), management plan (prescribing), follow-up or sequelae (re-presentation or referral to hospital), and service context (mode of consultation and clinician consulting). Data were collected using a study-specific instrument created by the team (see Appendix 1), drawing on evidence from our previous GP survey in this field, reading of the literature, and clinical expertise. This tool was applied by each of the investigators in their own practice. All data were anonymized and then exported to Microsoft Excel. Results were double-checked by a second investigator.

Consultation data were converted into categorical (nominal data) where appropriate. The analysis used descriptive statistical analysis of practice-level clinical behavior to answer research questions 1–4. An analysis plan was applied using descriptive statistics to assess incidence, demographics of patients, proportions of consultations by consultation modality and clinician, prevalence of symptoms/signs, and the proportions of treatment modalities. Results are to one decimal place. Question 5 used a different approach, based on analysis of the nine English practices, as data was not available for the Welsh tenth practice. This analysis sought to describe the proportion of flucloxacillin prescriptions issued at each practice accounted for by insect bite management. Data describing monthly prescribing of flucloxacillin at each of the 9 practices were utilized.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics and the comparative effects of different antibiotics.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1131R2RH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues that recurs in approximately one-third of cases. The only proven strategy to reduce recurrence risk is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. Given concerns about antibiotic resistance and the pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing, other prevention strategies are needed.

This study aimed to explore patients' views about cellulitis and different ways of preventing recurrent episodes. Adults aged 18 years and older, with a history of first-episode or recurrent cellulitis, were invited through primary care, hospitals, and advertising to complete a survey, participate in an interview, or both.

Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017, and 240 surveys were completed with a response rate of 17%. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data showed that people who have had cellulitis possess wide-ranging beliefs about what causes cellulitis and are often unaware of the risk of recurrence or potential prevention strategies. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercising, and losing weight were more popular potential strategies than using compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution about long-term oral antibiotics, particularly those who had experienced only one episode of cellulitis.

In conclusion, people who have had cellulitis are keen to learn about possible ways to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercising, and losing weight were generally preferred strategies.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1114WZ9H]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a disease that can be associated with a range of conditions and exposures. Recent surgery, venous leg ulcer, and exposure to insect bites are some key associations. An increased blood neutrophil count, chills, and elevated serum CRP levels are common indicators. The disease is also linked to diabetes mellitus, skin induration, and positive blood bacterial cultures. Other associations include tinea pedis, skin injuries, increased ESR, and elevated WBC count. The condition can lead to intertrigo, pain, and malaise, as well as exposure to spider bites, lymphadenopathy, and exposure to animal bites. Liver cirrhosis, skin abscess, tachycardia, skin erythema, and chronic venous insufficiency may also be related.

Additional symptoms could include hypotension, skin discharge, tenderness, warmth, and impetigo. Fever, skin edema, pressure ulcers, tachypnea, PAD, and injection drug use are relevant factors. Lymphedema, exposure to human bites, peau d'orange, and an immunocompromising condition also play a role in cellulitis.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of ibuprofen compared to placebo for uncomplicated cellulitis of the upper or lower limb [^113L5GLg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a common skin infection resulting in inflammation that may take weeks to resolve despite appropriate antibiotics. It is unclear whether the adjunctive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs hastens the resolution of inflammation in patients with cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for 5 days with an identical placebo in adults with uncomplicated cellulitis of the upper or lower limb. These patients were treated with intravenous cefazolin via an outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment service at one of two Australian hospitals. Participants were assessed twice daily by a study nurse. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with regression of inflammation 48 hours after the first effective dose of parenteral antibiotics (trial registration ANZCTR 12611000515998).

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 48 had sufficient data available to be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Inflammation had begun to regress at 48 hours in 20 participants (80%) in the ibuprofen group compared to 15 (65%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference +15%; 95% confidence interval -10 to +40; p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in any secondary outcome. Ibuprofen appeared safe, with no patients developing renal impairment or necrotizing fasciitis.

This trial demonstrated no significant benefit of adjunctive ibuprofen in adults with uncomplicated cellulitis. The trial was powered to detect a large effect; however, it concluded with no significant benefit observed.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^1153LvBf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012).

Penicillin has been used as a long-term medication for many years in other conditions such as rheumatic fever, and group A streptococcus has remained susceptible to penicillin for over 60 years without signs of developing resistance. It therefore represents a very cost-effective intervention (£18 per 6-month course) with potential for substantial health savings. Assuming a number needed to treat (NNT) of 8, this equates to a treatment cost of £144 per episode of cellulitis prevented.

It is disappointing that the trial failed to achieve its recruitment target of 400 participants and thus failed to provide sufficient evidence on which to base firm conclusions. Nevertheless, the trial does suggest a potentially large protective effect that was consistent throughout the follow-up period and robust in the sensitivity analysis.

Future cellulitis trials can benefit from the experiences of the PATCH II trial in designing trials that might recruit patients with cellulitis more successfully. Indeed, the PATCH I trial, which is due to report in early 2012, introduced modifications to the trial design and conduct as a result of our experiences with PATCH II. This trial successfully recruited 274 participants (105% of the original sample size requirement). Changes to the protocol included:

- **Eligibility criteria**: Amending the eligibility criteria so that patients who had had an episode of cellulitis within the last 6 months (rather than 3 months) were able to take part.
- **Case report forms**: Amending the case report forms so that recruiting clinicians were able to concentrate on essential medical information, with more routine clinical trial data being collected efficiently.

### Microbiological and clinical features of patients with cellulitis in tropical Australia: Disease severity assessment and implications for clinical management [^114GHBWg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Australian guidelines for the treatment of cellulitis are informed by data from temperate, metropolitan centers. It is uncertain if these guidelines are equally applicable in tropical Australia, where the population, access to healthcare, and array of potential pathogens are quite different. This retrospective study examined adults admitted to Cairns Hospital in tropical Queensland, Australia, who were treated with intravenous antibiotics for a principal diagnosis of cellulitis in 2019.

The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings in these cases and the resulting implications for patient management. There were 305 episodes of cellulitis; a potential pathogen was identified in 93/305 (30%), most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (45/93, 48%) or Group A Streptococcus (16/93, 17%). There was one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei.

Initial treatment was most commonly with narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, with flucloxacillin prescribed in 170/305 (56%) and cefazolin prescribed in 74/305 (26%). Overall, 4/305 (1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days, 123/305 (40%) had an inpatient stay > 48 hours, and 63/305 (21%) were readmitted to hospital within 30 days. Every patient who subsequently died or required ICU admission had an elevated early warning score (EWS ≥ 3) on admission.

An EWS ≥ 3 on admission also predicted an inpatient stay of > 48 hours (odds ratio [OR]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7–6.0; P < 0.001) and 30-day readmission (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2–4.6; P = 0.01). The etiology of cellulitis in tropical Queensland, Australia, suggests a unique management approach may be needed.

### Challenging dogma: Optimal treatment of the "fight bite" [^112QDH35]. Hand (2020). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment of human bites to the dorsal metacarpophalangeal region (i.e. "fight bite") in the absence of gross purulence is controversial. Few studies have compared the outcomes of operative debridement with expectant wound care and oral antibiotics.

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients evaluated at a Level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of patients across treatment and outcome groups using the Fisher exact test. Logistic regression models were used to describe the relationships between the outcome and treatment variables.

We identified 115 patients with a mean age of 29 years. The mean follow-up was 51.8 days. Seventy-two (63%) patients were treated with antibiotics only. Thirty-two (28%) patients received irrigation in the emergency department (ED) and expectant wound care. Eleven (9%) patients underwent irrigation and debridement in the operating room. No demographic variables were found to correlate with the treatment selected.

A 12% complication rate (major and minor) was observed. After adjusting for duration of follow-up and days to presentation, neither the treatment rendered nor the antibiotics selected influenced the rate of complications. Time to presentation greater than 24 hours was the only variable associated with a higher complication rate (P = 0.003). Not all fight bites require operative intervention. Irrigation in the ED with expectant wound care and oral antibiotics can be sufficient for patients presenting within 24 hours.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^111WuyAf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Some participants spoke about keeping precautionary antibiotics at home that had been prescribed by their GP for immediate use if their cellulitis recurred, which seemed to reduce their anxiety about recurrence.

- **Patient perspective**: "So when I've got it – it just – it is debilitating, it just knocks you out and you can't do anything and so the best thing is to see a doctor and get an immediate course of antibiotics. So the good thing [is], this last time I saw my GP, I got an emergency pack of antibiotics, flucloxacillin, that I can take in case I get it. So thinking about it happening again fills me with dread almost, but the good thing is I've got this back‐up emergency course of antibiotics that I can take if it happens again".

For some participants, the uncertainty around what caused their cellulitis seemed to have created uncertainty about prevention of recurrence. Some participants who had only experienced one episode of cellulitis felt that it was difficult to know how to prevent it from coming back as they were not certain what had caused their first episode of cellulitis.

- **Case uncertainty**: "And I must admit, I didn't know that it was cellulitis till it was all written down; I thought I'd just got Strep A because of – I mean I suppose you won't know, can cellulitis alone do that to you? I mean, it nearly killed me. I'm very lucky to be alive and I certainly don't want it again, but I don't know what to do not to get it again. And no one does, and no one knows how I got it".

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful.

Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113im5Mo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, with additional reference to the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (record CRD42017080466, November 2017).

- **Objectives**: The primary objective for this review was to identify and describe diagnostic criteria and tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess the quality of the studies where diagnostic criteria or tools were developed.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies including patients with lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas in primary and secondary care, which used diagnostic criteria or tools for diagnosis, were included.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The following inclusion criteria were applied: any study type that used diagnostic criteria or tools, in any language, involving patients of any age, sex, or ethnicity, who had lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The following articles were excluded: animal studies; laboratory in vitro studies; literature and systematic review articles; expert opinions; conference abstracts; articles that included only patients with non-lower-limb cellulitis; articles where the site of cellulitis or erysipelas was not clear; articles where data from lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas could not be separated; articles that used tools to determine etiology; case series with fewer than 20 patients.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^111zMpSj]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Our novel approach seeks to generate real-world practice-based evidence using QI approaches. The IBG is a professionally led group based within the RCGP using practice-based research to exchange knowledge with colleagues, analyze patient health care use, explore management dilemmas, and define future research activity. This is the first report on management of a cohort of primary care insect bite practice to our knowledge. QI approaches create some limitations as insect bites were selected by searching on coded data; some may therefore be missing from the data set. The number of total bites occurring in the population and self-managed versus the number presenting to all primary care providers versus those presenting to general practices is unknown. Patients may also attend walk-in clinics, out-of-hours services, community pharmacists, and A&E departments for insect bite concerns. Our practices were not randomized, and practice list size varied greatly, introducing possible bias.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study reported an overall unchanged prescribing of antibiotics compared to that forecast, but a reduction of flucloxacillin prescribing of 12.7% compared to forecasts for the month of July 2020. We do not know how this may have affected our study. Reduced social contact and reduced travel abroad but increased exercise in local open spaces will have created some changes to patients' behavior and also to pandemic prescribing. Our study reflects insect bite issues from England as well as Wales rather than travel abroad, which was much more common before the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116Nd4xN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Patients, bacterial etiology, and antibiotic treatment were analyzed in this study involving 216 patients. The clinical characteristics and bacterial etiology have been documented in previous publications. To summarize, the median age of participants was 54.5 years, ranging from 18 to 94 years, and 57% had lower extremity infections. Out of 203 patients evaluated for BHS (beta-hemolytic streptococci) etiology, 72% had confirmed BHS, while an additional 13% were identified with probable BHS infection. Notably, no cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were detected.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^113swjNC]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Time from presentation was recorded in 79.2% of cases. The mode of presentation was 1–3 days post-bite in 42.5% of the cohort, with a range of presentations from within 1 day to over 3 weeks. There were single bite presentations in 58.3% of cases, and multiple bites in 38%, with 3.7% unrecorded. The site of the bite was not recorded in 58% of cases, possibly due to image use. When recorded, the sites were mainly the lower limb (27%), facial (2.3%), and the eye area (0.9%).

Recorded symptoms and signs were reported by patients or GPCs during consultations. Redness occurred in 77.7% of cases, itch in 45.4%, heat in 36.9%, and pain in 31.5%. Swelling was recorded in 19.7% and discharge in 6.8%. Systemic upset, such as malaise, was recorded in 10.7% of cases, with 8.1% of malaise reported in phone-only consultations. Pyrexia (> 37.5°C) was recorded in 1.4% of the cases, while other vital signs, such as pulse, were noted in 7.6% of the cohort. Comorbidities could not be reported on, as it was unclear if GPCs accessed "digital problem screens". Additionally, the size of the bites could not be analyzed due to uncertainty regarding whether it included areas of surrounding inflammation. No systemic allergic reactions were presented, nor were any other insect-borne diseases reported. Cases of Lyme disease had already been excluded.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, resulting in unnecessary antibiotic use and increased health care costs.

The objective of this study was to determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment in patients with cellulitis. This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up period. Patients were randomized into two groups: the control group, which received the standard of care (treatment by the primary medicine team), and the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. A review of medical charts for demographic information and hospital courses was performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1,300 patients were screened, 1,125 were excluded, and 175 were included in the study. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Of the 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men, with a mean age of 58.8 years. The length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment was measured, but specifics are not fully detailed in the provided section.
