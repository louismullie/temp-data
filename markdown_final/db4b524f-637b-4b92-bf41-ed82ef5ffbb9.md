## Question

can pregnant patients have vaginal bleeding after sex?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pregnant patients can have vaginal bleeding after sex, what that might indicate, and how it should be managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline prevalence of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. Then, I should verify the anatomic and physiologic reasons that intercourse could precipitate bleeding. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis for bleeding in pregnancy, especially distinguishing benign causes from serious ones. After that, I need to outline a practical, safety-focused evaluation pathway. Finally, I should consider management nuances, including when reassurance is appropriate versus when intervention is needed, and how to counsel patients about sex during pregnancy.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, because I need to ensure I am not overstating the role of intercourse. Vaginal bleeding in the first 20 weeks is common, with cohort data showing roughly 17–23% of women experiencing bleeding in early gestation, which establishes that bleeding can occur even without intercourse and that pregnancy itself increases vascular fragility and bleeding propensity in the lower genital tract and endometrium [^1163hYWT].

> Now, I will examine why intercourse could trigger bleeding during pregnancy. Wait, let me verify the key mechanisms: the cervix becomes more friable due to estrogen-mediated changes, cervical ectropion is more prominent, and the endocervical epithelium is easily traumatized. The vaginal mucosa is more delicate. And subchorionic hematomas, if present, may be irritated by uterine activity or cervical motion, all of which can lead to postcoital spotting or bleeding even when the pregnancy is otherwise normal [^117V6z3G].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — postcoital bleeding in pregnancy is not always benign, so I need to check the differential. Common and usually less concerning causes include cervical ectropion, cervical polyps, cervicitis, and contact-related microtrauma; more serious but less common causes include subchorionic hemorrhage, placenta previa in the second and third trimesters, vasa previa, preterm labor, and, of course, early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy, which must always be considered and excluded when bleeding occurs in the first trimester [^117V6z3G].

> I should confirm the immediate evaluation priorities. First, I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and quantify blood loss. Then, I should obtain a focused history including timing relative to intercourse, pain, passage of tissue, prior bleeding, and STI risk. Next, I will perform a speculum exam to visualize the cervix for polyps, ectropion, lacerations, or active bleeding, and a bimanual exam to assess uterine size and adnexal tenderness. I should obtain a quantitative hCG in all first-trimester presentations and use transvaginal ultrasound to confirm intrauterine location, viability, and look for subchorionic collections, reserving MRI only for problem-solving if ultrasound is nondiagnostic. I also need to check Rh status and give anti-D immune globulin to Rh-negative patients with bleeding, and consider STI testing when risk is present [^11282eJ5] [^1137kK1p] [^115Uj3Vs].

> Let me think about how to interpret findings. If ultrasound shows a normal intrauterine pregnancy with cardiac activity and no concerning placental or cervical pathology, and the cervix looks benign, then postcoital bleeding is most consistent with cervical friability or ectropion and reassurance is reasonable. If a subchorionic hematoma is present, I should counsel on prognosis and activity modification while monitoring. If there is no intrauterine pregnancy, I must exclude ectopic with serial hCG and repeat ultrasound. If bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain or tissue passage, I should evaluate for miscarriage and discuss expectant, medical, or procedural management based on patient preference and stability [^11282eJ5] [^112ZAcDF] [^114fDRGz].

> But wait, what if the patient is in the second or third trimester? I should double-check placental location and exclude placenta previa before any digital or speculum cervical exam, because digital or instrumental cervical manipulation can precipitate hemorrhage. If previa is suspected, transabdominal or transperineal ultrasound is appropriate, and management should be guided by maternal-fetal specialists with plans for delivery and hemorrhage preparedness rather than outpatient reassurance alone [^116xsbf6] [^112sJX2j].

> Next, I should review counseling and management for benign postcoital bleeding in pregnancy. Let me verify that most patients with minor, painless spotting after sex and reassuring ultrasound can be reassured and advised to avoid intercourse temporarily until bleeding resolves, to use lubricants to reduce friction, and to report any increase in bleeding, cramping, fever, or passage of tissue; routine pelvic rest is not universally required, but short-term avoidance of intercourse is reasonable while monitoring, and resumption can be individualized once bleeding has settled and the patient feels comfortable [^117V6z3G].

> I need to ensure I address patient concerns about causality. Patients often ask whether sex caused a miscarriage. I should explain that while intercourse can unmask bleeding from friable cervical tissue or a small subchorionic collection, it does not cause genetically mediated early pregnancy loss, and that most first-trimester bleeding episodes — even after sex — resolve without adverse outcomes when the pregnancy is otherwise normal, though any new bleeding warrants evaluation to exclude ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage [^117V6z3G].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent reassessment. Heavy bleeding with clots, syncope or orthostatic symptoms, severe pain, fever, or passage of tissue should prompt immediate evaluation for hemodynamic instability, possible miscarriage, infection, or placental pathology. In these scenarios, urgent obstetric consultation, IV access, type and screen, and consideration of procedural management are indicated rather than outpatient observation [^112ZAcDF] [^112sJX2j].

> In summary, yes — pregnant patients can have vaginal bleeding after sex, most often due to cervical friability, ectropion, polyps, cervicitis, or irritation of a subchorionic hematoma. However, I need to ensure that ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage are excluded and that placental location is appropriate before attributing bleeding to benign causes, and I should tailor counseling and follow-up to the findings and patient preferences while maintaining vigilance for warning signs [^117V6z3G] [^11282eJ5] [^116xsbf6].

Pregnant patients can experience **postcoital bleeding** due to cervical friability, cervical ectropion, or cervical polyps, which are common in pregnancy and typically benign [^notfound]. However, bleeding after sex can also signal serious conditions such as placenta previa, placental abruption, or preterm labor, especially in the second or third trimester [^116xsbf6]. Any bleeding during pregnancy warrants evaluation with a focused history, exam, and ultrasound to confirm placental location and fetal well-being [^11282eJ5]. Patients should be advised to avoid intercourse until the cause is identified and to seek immediate care if bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain, fever, or dizziness [^112ZAcDF].

---

## Physiological changes during pregnancy contributing to postcoital bleeding

Pregnancy induces **physiological changes** that increase the likelihood of bleeding after sexual intercourse:

- **Cervical friability**: Increased vascularity and softening of the cervix make it more prone to bleeding with minimal trauma [^notfound].

- **Cervical ectropion**: The endocervical columnar epithelium extends onto the ectocervix, becoming exposed and friable, leading to bleeding upon contact [^notfound].

- **Increased blood flow**: Estrogen-driven vascular proliferation increases cervical and vaginal blood flow, making minor trauma more likely to cause bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Common benign causes of postcoital bleeding in pregnancy

Several **benign conditions** commonly cause postcoital bleeding in pregnant patients:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cervical friability | Softening and increased vascularity of the cervix causing bleeding with minimal trauma [^notfound] |
| Cervical ectropion | Extension of endocervical epithelium onto the ectocervix, making it friable and prone to bleeding [^117V6z3G] |
| Cervical polyps | Benign growths on the cervix that may bleed with intercourse [^117V6z3G] |
| Subchorionic hemorrhage | Small hematomas between the placenta and uterine wall causing spotting or light bleeding [^117V6z3G] |

---

## Serious complications associated with postcoital bleeding in pregnancy

While many cases are benign, postcoital bleeding can signal **serious complications** that require immediate medical attention:

- **Placenta previa**: Low-lying placenta covering the cervix, causing painless, bright red bleeding; intercourse is contraindicated [^notfound].

- **Placental abruption**: Premature separation of the placenta, causing painful bleeding and risking fetal hypoxia [^notfound].

- **Preterm labor**: Bleeding may precede labor, especially in the second or third trimester [^notfound].

- **Infections**: Cervicitis or sexually transmitted infections can cause bleeding and require treatment [^117V6z3G].

---

## Clinical evaluation of postcoital bleeding in pregnancy

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to determine the cause and guide management:

- **History**: Onset, duration, amount, associated symptoms (pain, fever, dizziness), and obstetric history [^114fDRGz].

- **Physical examination**: Speculum exam to visualize the cervix, bimanual exam to assess uterine size and tenderness [^112RMzVR].

- **Ultrasound**: Transvaginal ultrasound to confirm placental location, fetal viability, and exclude placenta previa or abruption [^116xsbf6].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, type and screen, and STI screening as indicated [^115Uj3Vs].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**, gestational age, and severity of bleeding:

- **Benign causes**: Reassurance, pelvic rest, and avoidance of intercourse until bleeding resolves [^notfound].

- **Placenta previa**: Strict pelvic rest, avoidance of intercourse, and close monitoring [^notfound].

- **Placental abruption**: Immediate hospitalization, maternal stabilization, and fetal monitoring [^112sJX2j].

- **Infections**: Appropriate antibiotic therapy and partner treatment if STI is diagnosed [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling and precautions

Patients should be counseled on the following **precautions**:

- **Avoid intercourse**: Until the cause of bleeding is identified and resolved.

- **Seek immediate care**: If bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain, fever, or dizziness [^112ZAcDF].

- **Report symptoms**: Any recurrence of bleeding or new symptoms should be reported promptly [^114fDRGz].

---

## Conclusion

Pregnant patients can experience postcoital bleeding due to benign cervical changes, but it can also indicate serious complications. Any bleeding during pregnancy should be **evaluated promptly** to ensure maternal and fetal safety.

Risk of Ectopic Pregnancy: Advise the patient about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the loss of fertility. Teach her to recognize and report to her healthcare provider promptly any symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]
Risks of Intrauterine Pregnancy: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she thinks she might be pregnant. Inform the patient about the risks of intrauterine pregnancy while using Mirena, including the risks of leaving Mirena in place and the risks of removing Mirena or probing of the uterus. If Mirena cannot be removed in a pregnant patient, advise her to report immediately any symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy. Advise her of isolated reports of virilization of the female fetus following local exposure to LNG during pregnancy with an LNG IUS in place. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Special Populations (8.1).]
Sepsis: Counsel the patient that severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), can occur within the first few days after Mirena is inserted. Instruct her to contact a healthcare provider immediately if she develops severe pain or fever shortly after Mirena is inserted. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]
Pelvic Infection: Advise the patient about the possibility of pelvic infections, including PID, and that these infections can cause tubal damage leading to ectopic pregnancy or infertility, or infrequently can necessitate hysterectomy, or cause death. Teach patients to recognize and report to their healthcare provider promptly any symptoms of pelvic infection. These symptoms include development of menstrual disorders (prolonged or heavy bleeding), unusual vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain or tenderness, dyspareunia, chills, and fever. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4).]
Perforation and Expulsion: Advise the patient that the IUS may be expelled from or perforate the uterus and instruct her on how she can check that the threads still protrude from the cervix. Inform her that excessive pain or vaginal bleeding during Mirena placement, worsening pain or bleeding after placement, or the inability to feel Mirena strings may occur with Mirena perforation and expulsion. Caution her not to pull on the threads and displace Mirena. Inform her that there is no contraceptive protection if Mirena is displaced or expelled. Instruct the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she cannot feel the threads and to avoid intercourse or use a non-hormonal back-up birth control (such as condoms or spermicide) until the location of Mirena has been confirmed. Advise her that if perforation occurs, Mirena will have to be located and removed; surgery may be required. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.10).]
Ovarian Cysts: Advise the patient regarding the risk of ovarian cysts and that cysts can cause clinical symptoms including pelvic pain, abdominal pain or dyspareunia. Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she experiences these symptoms. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7).]
Bleeding Pattern Alterations: Advise the patient that irregular or prolonged bleeding and spotting, and/or cramps may occur during the first few weeks after insertion. Inform the patient that, during the first 3–6 months of Mirena use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may be higher and bleeding patterns may be irregular. If her symptoms continue or are severe, she should report them to her healthcare provider. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).]
Clinical Considerations for Use and Removal: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she experiences any of the following:
A stroke or heart attack
Very severe or migraine headaches
Unexplained fever
Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, as these may be signs of serious liver problems

Early pregnancy loss — confirmation and management states that early pregnancy loss during the first trimester is commonly known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion; because many are unable to establish prenatal care until after the first trimester, providers of SRH care should be able to identify signs and symptoms of early pregnancy loss and be equipped to provide appropriate treatment or referrals, and all pregnant persons should receive information about signs and symptoms and be given instructions to report concerns for further evaluation; providers can confirm early pregnancy loss by reviewing medical history, identifying signs and symptoms such as vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain and bleeding and/or passage of tissue, and/or by conducting a physical exam that may include a pelvic ultrasound and quantitative β-hCG testing; pregnancy loss can be managed expectantly, with medications, or with uterine aspiration, with expectant management essentially "wait and watch" with no medical interventions; persons experiencing pregnancy loss may benefit from additional social support and providers can assess need and refer to appropriate counseling or supportive services.

### Pitfalls in first-trimester bleeding [^114F8s7S]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The focus of this article is first-trimester bleeding. Vaginal bleeding during the first 3 months of pregnancy is a common event. It is important that the emergency physicians recognize patients with vaginal bleeding who may have an adverse outcome if misdiagnosed or not treated appropriately in the emergency department. Causes of first-trimester vaginal bleeding include implantation bleeding, spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancy, and lesions involving the female reproductive system and perineal area infections.

### Insertion and removal of intrauterine devices [^111m8W5G]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The intrauterine device (IUD) is an effective contraceptive for many women. The copper-releasing IUD can be used for 10 years before replacement and is a good choice for women who cannot, or choose not to, use hormone-releasing contraceptives. However, some women experience an increase in menstrual blood loss and dysmenorrhea. The progestin-releasing IUD can be used for five years. It may reduce menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea, although some women have increased spotting and bleeding during the first months after insertion. The ideal candidates for IUD use are parous women in stable, monogamous relationships. Pregnancy, unexplained vaginal bleeding, and a lifestyle placing the woman at risk for sexually transmitted diseases are contraindications to IUD use. Insertion of the IUD can take place at any time during the menstrual cycle provided the woman is not pregnant. Before insertion, a bimanual examination and a sounding of the uterus are necessary to determine the uterus position and the depth of the uterine cavity. The IUD is inserted into the uterus according to individual protocols, with the threads cut at a length to allow the patient to check the device's position. Expulsion may occur with both types of IUDs.

### The patient with non-pregnancy-associated vaginal bleeding [^1111i6bw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) unrelated to pregnancy affects 20% to 30% of women at some point in life and is a common emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) presentation. AUB is a complex condition with extensive terminology, broad differential diagnosis, and numerous treatment options, yet few published evidence-based guidelines. In the ED or UC setting most affected patients are often more frustrated than acutely ill. These factors can make for a challenging patient encounter in the EC/UC setting. This article reviews acute and chronic AUB in the nonpregnant patient and suggests a simplified approach for its evaluation and management.

### Sex matters: practice 5P's when treating young women with venous thromboembolism [^111FAnCX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no studies that report data on menstrual bleeding patterns in women treated with unfractionated heparin or low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH). Treatment duration with unfractionated heparin or LMWH is relatively short and prescribed in a prophylactic dosage in the majority of patients. Patients of fertile age treated with therapeutic‐dose LMWH often are pregnant patients or patients treated for cancer. In these populations, menstrual blood loss is either absent or a non‐issue.

2.1 Management of abnormal uterine bleeding

Abnormal uterine bleeding is chronic in nature and it negatively impacts quality of life. 21 Therefore, adequate treatment is imperative. A step‐by‐step assessment and management strategy in women using anticoagulants was recently discussed by Boonyawat and colleagues. 22 They suggest that clinical assessment includes at least evaluation of anticoagulant therapy intensity, need for ongoing anticoagulation (see also paragraph in Section 4) and evaluation of anemia and iron status. 22 Referral to a gynecologist is mandatory when additional underlying uterine abnormalities are suspected. 23

Suggested management options encompass 3 main potential approaches: (a) hormonal therapy, (b) tranexamic acid and (c) modification of anticoagulant therapy. Table A1 displays an evidence‐based summary of management strategies for abnormal vaginal bleeding during anticoagulant treatment.

5.3	Bone Loss

Treatment with SLYND leads to decreased estradiol serum levels. It is unknown if this may cause a clinically relevant loss of bone mineral density.

5.4	Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggest that use of combination hormonal contraceptives containing progestin and estradiol has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

5.5	Liver Disease

Discontinue SLYND if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and SLYND causation has been excluded.

SLYND is contraindicated in females with liver tumors, benign or malignant, or hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.6	Ectopic Pregnancy

Be alert to the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in females who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on SLYND.

5.7	Risk of Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes

Some patients receiving progestins, including SLYND, may exhibit a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Therefore, patients with diabetes may be at greater risk of hyperglycemia and may require additional medication adjustments or monitoring.

5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Females using SLYND may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first three months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

Based on subject diaries from four clinical trials of SLYND, 64.4% of females experienced unscheduled bleeding at Cycle 1. This percentage decreased to 40.3% by Cycle 13.

A total of 91 out of 2593 subjects (3.5%) discontinued SLYND due to menstrual bleeding disorders including metrorrhagia, menstrual irregular, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, uterine hemorrhage, and amenorrhea.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or two active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^113xcd5b]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception [^112xYYtz]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for abnormal uterine bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients on hormonal contraception, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering daily oral contraceptives to resolve AUB associated with the progestin implant, while informing patients that continued use may be required.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^111q1kZg]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results of our present study demonstrate that HMB has a negative impact on sexual activity and causes sexual distress in the majority of women with a CPD or unknown bleeding tendency. Women also mentioned that doctors should address this topic more often in the consultation room. Discussing the possible implications of bleeding tendency on sexual health may not only support women in feeling recognised in their disease, but it may also allow to discuss possible solutions. According to our present data, topics that should be discussed in the consultation room include impact and treatment options of HMB, postcoital bleeding and contact bleeding, including practical tips. The behaviour of partners as a possible (unconscious) contributing factor on distress was not specifically investigated in the present study, but multiple women mentioned the importance of their partner's attitude in the free‐text fields of the questionnaires. A survey amongst 301 Dutch men aged 18–45 years of the general population who had been in a relationship for ≥ 6 months, reported that 31% of the men questioned did not want to see menstrual blood loss at all. Key motives these men raised were the possible negative effect of this on the couple's sex life, social life and relationship quality. This emphasises the need to discuss the effects of vaginal bleeding on (sexual) health in the consultation room.

About half of the women in our present study reported excessive peripartum bleeding, requiring platelet and/or blood transfusion in ~15% of deliveries. This is comparable to the self‐reported incidence of excessive peripartum blood loss in women with von Willebrand disease (51%) or women with different kinds of CPDs (ranging from 37 to 63%), and is much higher than the 19% reported in the general population. Guidelines from the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctor's Organisation (UKHCDO) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) on the management of inherited bleeding disorders in pregnancy advise pre‐pregnancy counselling by a multidisciplinary specialist team with expertise in caring for patients with platelet function disorders. More progress should be made in the identification of obstetric problems in these women and defining optimal obstetric management.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive care in the context of pandemic response [^113NempZ]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

In-person contraceptive services during the pandemic — visits requiring in-person care: Telemedicine is not suitable for all contraceptive services. Schedule patients who desire an intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant for an in-person visit without delay, including in the context of high community transmission rates if another method is not available or acceptable; expedite appointments for IUD insertion for emergency contraception, and offer IUD or implant placement immediately after abortion, management of early pregnancy loss, or vaginal or cesarean delivery to reduce the need for additional in-person visits. For most patients, LARC removal requires an in-person visit; some patients with IUDs can be counseled about attempts at self-removal but this is not always successful, and we do not recommend self-removal of contraceptive implants, noting only case reports with no data on safety or efficacy and a possible lack of aseptic technique leading to infection. Patients who report a positive pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain should have an immediate in-person visit with pelvic exam and serum labs with pelvic ultrasound if indicated, and this also applies to any patient who is pregnant with an IUD in situ. For suspected IUD expulsion or non-palpable implant, for asymptomatic patients prescribe EC if indicated and counsel on a different contraceptive method until an in-person visit is possible; severe symptoms require an immediate visit, while mild symptoms that are not bothersome can be delayed if there is no concern for pregnancy and if a patient is willing to use an alternate method or accepts the risk of contraceptive failure. For DMPA-IM, counsel patients about the subcutaneous (SC) formulation; for those continuing DMPA-IM, injections can be delayed up to 15 weeks. For patients needing these services, consider hybrid visits in which counseling and informed consent occur virtually and only the procedure occurs in the clinic; this decreases face-to-face time and thus viral exposure.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111P292q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only pills (POPs) — initiation timing and need for back-up contraception, including amenorrhea and postpartum breastfeeding: All POPs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant. For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, if started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed; if started > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 2 days. For drospirenone (DRSP) POPs, if started on the first day of menstrual bleeding, no additional contraceptive protection is needed; if started > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 7 days. In amenorrhea (not postpartum), all POPs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant; with norethindrone or norgestrel POPs the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 2 days, and with DRSP POPs the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 7 days. In postpartum breastfeeding, all POPs may be started at any time, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 2 if < 30 days postpartum; U.S. MEC 1 if ≥ 30 days postpartum), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant; if the patient is < 6 months postpartum, amenorrheic, and fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥ 85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), no additional contraceptive protection is needed; for norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, a patient who is ≥ 21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 2 days, and if the patient's menstrual cycle has returned and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 2 days.

Bleeding tendency and HMB

Our self‐developed questionnaire to investigate the impact of bleeding tendency on sexuality was returned by 75 women in the analysis group. Some women did not complete one or more questions related to themes that were either not applicable for them or they felt uncomfortable to talk about. Missing data were removed from the analysis. This explains the changing denominator throughout this section. Sexuality and bleeding tendency were discussed during outpatient evaluations in 21% of the consultations: this topic was initiated by doctors in 5% (four of 75) and by women themselves in 16% (12/75) of the study population. Discussing this topic would be appreciated by 21% (16/75) of women, whereas 41% (31/75) were unsure about this and 37% (43/75) were not interested. Menstruations negatively impacted sexual activity in 59% (41/69) of women: 32 women reported this was due to long or heavy menstruations, eight expressed feelings of insecurity and some women indicated feeling unclean. Two women described that intercourse caused heavy bleeding. Four women (15%, 4/27) used tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding during intercourse.

Due to the bleeding tendency, sexual activity was marginally disrupted in 33% (22/67), while 6% (four of 67) reported to be severely restricted in sexual activity. One woman reported that sexual intercourse was impossible considering her bleeding tendency. HMB (25%, 17/67), fatigue (15%, 10/67), pain (10%, seven of 67) and postcoital bleeding (6%, four of 67), were reported as main reasons for restricted sexual activity.

During menstruation, 22% (15/69) of women reported to have sexual intercourse, in which additional protection against blood loss in the form of towels was used by 53% (eight of 15). Blood loss other than menstrual bleeding during sexual intercourse was experienced occasionally in 21% (15/71) of the women, while 3% (two of 71) to 4% (three of 71) of women experienced this frequently to always, respectively.

### Ultrasound assessment of premenopausal bleeding [^112JZyLc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is the most common cause of emergency care in the first trimester of pregnancy and accounts for the majority of premenopausal bleeding cases. Ultrasound evaluation combined with a quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an established diagnostic tool to assess these patients. Spontaneous abortion because of genetic abnormalities is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding; ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are other important causes and in all patients presenting with first trimester bleeding, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected and excluded, as it is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. A thorough knowledge of the normal sonographic appearance of intrauterine gestation is essential to understand the manifestations of an abnormal gestation. Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus is a rare but important cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, as it has to be differentiated from the more common retained products of conception, with which it is often mistaken.

### Emergency evaluation and management of vaginal bleeding in the nonpregnant patient [^1133YwBK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the nonpregnant patient presenting to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding requires the emergency physician to be aware of the potential for a variety of underlying causes. Patients with vaginal bleeding may have non-life-threatening problems such as fibroids, endometriosis, or treatable sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydial infection. However, care must be taken to differentiate these from more serious causes of pelvic pain and bleeding such as ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic cyst, ovarian torsion, and rare complications from fibroids such as intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Abnormal bleeding unrelated to structural problems could have an anovulatory or ovulatory cause.

DMPA switching from another contraceptive method and intrauterine device (IUD) considerations: The first DMPA injection may be administered immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant, and waiting for the next menstrual cycle is unnecessary; if it has been > 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 7 days. When switching from an IUD and the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of the current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, residual sperm might be present; a health care provider may consider options including advising the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the injection and return for IUD removal, advising abstinence or barrier methods for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method (and if it has been ≤ 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 7 days), or if the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for 7 days, advising the use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal; if it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 7 days.

Timing of Repeat Injections

Reinjection Interval

Provide repeat DMPA injections every 3 months (13 weeks).

Special Considerations

Early Injection

The repeat DMPA injection may be administered early when necessary.

Late Injection

The repeat DMPA injection may be administered up to 2 weeks late (15 weeks from the last injection) without requiring additional contraceptive protection.
If the patient is > 2 weeks late (> 15 weeks from the last injection) for a repeat DMPA injection, they may have the injection if it is reasonably certain that they are not pregnant (Box 3). The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. The patient may consider the use of emergency contraception (with the exception of UPA) if appropriate.

Comments and Evidence Summary. No time limits exist for early injections; injections can be administered when necessary (e.g. when a patient cannot return at the routine interval). WHO has extended the time that a patient can have a late reinjection (i.e.g.race period) for DMPA use from 2 weeks to 4 weeks on the basis of data from one study demonstrating low pregnancy rates through 4 weeks; however, the CDC expert group did not consider the data to be generalizable to the United States because a large proportion of women in the study were breastfeeding. Therefore, U.S. SPR recommends a grace period of 2 weeks.

A systematic review identified 12 studies evaluating time to pregnancy or ovulation after the last injection of DMPA. Although pregnancy rates were low during the 2-week interval after the reinjection date and for 4 weeks after the reinjection date, data were sparse, and one study included a large proportion of breastfeeding women. Studies also indicated a wide variation in time to ovulation after the last DMPA injection, with the majority ranging from 15 to 49 weeks from the last injection (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) During Injectable Use

Before DMPA initiation, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during DMPA use. Amenorrhea and spotting or light bleeding are common with DMPA use, and heavy or prolonged bleeding can occur with DMPA use. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Spotting, light bleeding, and heavy or prolonged bleeding might decrease with continued DMPA use.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® first trimester vaginal bleeding: 2025 update [^11282eJ5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a relatively common occurrence in the first trimester of pregnancy, but can be distressing for both patients and clinicians. Differential considerations include normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, an ectopic pregnancy (EP), or much less commonly gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Although the diagnosis of EP, nonviable IUP, and GTD is important, it is also crucial to avoid harming potentially normal pregnancies through early medical or surgical treatment. Fortunately, most diagnoses can be made using a combination of ultrasound (US), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and physical examination. When a diagnosis is in question, serial examinations and close clinical evaluation is paramount. Occasionally, MRI of the pelvis without contrast may be helpful in problem-solving for challenging cases, where grayscale US is limited or when there is high concern for nontubal EP. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in the adolescent [^111QEuV2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common problem in adolescents. The differential diagnosis varies from pregnancy and infection to anovulation and coagulopathy. Careful history and examination can help elucidate the best next steps for workup and management. Heavy menstrual bleeding is particularly worrisome in this group not only when it occurs at menarche, but also anytime afterward when bleeding lasts longer than 7 days, blood loss is greater than 80 mL per cycle, or other warning signs that indicate a history of heavy bleeding such as anemia. Once conditions of pregnancy, infection, structural abnormalities, and hormonal causes have been ruled out, first-line treatment is medical management with hormonal therapy or nonhormonal options. Invasive measures are a last resort in this patient population, because maintenance of fertility is of critical importance.

### Abnormal vaginal bleeding in the nonpregnant patient [^112gEyo9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a common complaint in most emergency departments. Abnormal vaginal bleeding causes many patients a great deal of stress and inconvenience. Although treatment of most cases is straightforward, vaginal bleeding can herald serious occult disease including cancer, coagulopathy, and systemic illness. Vaginal bleeding can also be the initial complaint in patients suffering sexual abuse or trauma. From an emergency medicine perspective, vaginal bleeding should be approached in terms of whether the patient is stable or not. Subsequent evaluation should exclude or treat problems that might cause the patient's condition to deteriorate. The emergency physician is able to provide initial therapy for most causes of vaginal bleeding, and in most cases the patient must be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Implants

The ENG implant, a single rod with 68 mg of ENG, is available in the United States. Fewer than one implant user out of 100 become pregnant in the first year with typical use. The implant is long acting, is reversible, and can be used by patients of all ages, including adolescents. The implant does not protect against STIs, including HIV infection, and patients using the implant should be counseled that consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited. Patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

Initiation of Implants

Timing

The implant may be placed at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

If the implant is placed within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed.
If the implant is placed > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Special Considerations

Amenorrhea (Not Postpartum)

Timing: The implant may be placed at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Pregnancy and anogenital HPV-related disease in people with HIV — management and delivery considerations: Pregnant patients are best managed by an interdisciplinary team, podofilox should not be used during pregnancy (BIII), and evidence is insufficient to recommend imiquimod; other topical treatments such as BCA and TCA and ablative therapies (laser, cryotherapy, excision) can be used during pregnancy (AIII). Cesarean delivery is not known to prevent juvenile‑onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and no change in obstetrical management is indicated unless extensive condylomata might impede vaginal delivery or cause extensive bleeding (AIII). Cervical and anal cancer screening is recommended during pregnancy, cytobrush sampling can be done, and those with abnormal cervical cytology results should undergo colposcopy and cervical biopsy of lesions suspicious for high‑grade disease or cancer (BIII); endocervical curettage is contraindicated during pregnancy (AIII). During pregnancy, ASC‑US or LSIL can be managed the same as for all people with HIV, with deferral of colposcopy until at least 6 weeks postpartum acceptable (CIII). Treatment of CIN is not recommended during pregnancy unless invasive disease is suspected (AIII); patients with suspected cervical cancer should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist, and vaginal delivery is not recommended for people with ICC (AIII). For people with CIN without suspicion of invasive disease, re‑evaluation with co‑testing and colposcopy is recommended after 6 weeks postpartum (AIII), and people with CIN can deliver vaginally.

Timing of LNG-IUD Placement

The LNG-IUD may be placed at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

If the LNG-IUD is placed within the first 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed.
If the LNG-IUD is placed > 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Special Considerations

Amenorrhea (Not Postpartum)

Timing: The LNG-IUD may be placed at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Postpartum (Including Cesarean Delivery, Breastfeeding, or Nonbreastfeeding)

Timing: The LNG-IUD may be placed at any time postpartum, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1 or 2), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Postpartum placement of IUDs is safe. Higher rates of expulsion during the postpartum period should be considered as they relate to effectiveness, along with patient access to interval placement (i.e. not related to pregnancy) when expulsion rates are lower. The LNG-IUD should not be placed in a patient with postpartum sepsis (e.g. chorioamnionitis or endometritis) (U.S. MEC 4).
Need for back-up contraception: If the patient is < 6 months postpartum, amenorrheic, and fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥ 85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), no additional contraceptive protection is needed. Otherwise, a patient who is ≥ 21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. If the patient's menstrual cycle has returned and it has been > 7 days since menstrual bleeding began, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

### Does speculum examination have a role in assessing bleeding in early pregnancy? [^112RMzVR]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess to what extent a speculum examination after a bimanual examination influences the accuracy of diagnosis and subsequent management of women with bleeding in early pregnancy in an accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Method

A prospective study over a five month period included women presenting to A&E with vaginal bleeding at < 20/40. Exclusion criteria were haemodynamic instability or known cervical carcinoma. The clinician recorded a diagnosis and management plan on a standard questionnaire after bimanual examination and after subsequent speculum examination.

Results

236 women were included in the study. Of these, a total of three (1.3%) had a change of management plan and 10 (4.2%) patients had a change of diagnosis after speculum examination.

Conclusion

The results suggest that speculum examination contributes to a minority of management decisions. The need for speculum examination should be assessed on a case by case basis depending on whether the findings on bimanual are conclusive.

### Etonogestrel (Nexplanon) [^117Bqm6o]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Changes in Menstrual Bleeding Patterns

After starting NEXPLANON, women are likely to have a change from their normal menstrual bleeding pattern. These may include changes in bleeding frequency (absent, less, more frequent or continuous), intensity (reduced or increased) or duration. In clinical trials of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant (IMPLANON), bleeding patterns ranged from amenorrhea (1 in 5 women) to frequent and/or prolonged bleeding (1 in 5 women). The bleeding pattern experienced during the first three months of NEXPLANON use is broadly predictive of the future bleeding pattern for many women. Women should be counseled regarding the bleeding pattern changes they may experience so that they know what to expect. Abnormal bleeding should be evaluated as needed to exclude pathologic conditions or pregnancy.

In clinical studies of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant, reports of changes in bleeding pattern were the most common reason for stopping treatment (11.1%). Irregular bleeding (10.8%) was the single most common reason women stopped treatment, while amenorrhea (0.3%) was cited less frequently. In these studies, women had an average of 17.7 days of bleeding or spotting every 90 days (based on 3,315 intervals of 90 days recorded by 780 patients). The percentages of patients having 0, 1–7, 8–21, or > 21 days of spotting or bleeding over a 90-day interval while using the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant are shown in Table 1.

Bleeding patterns observed with use of the non-radiopaque etonogestrel implant for up to 2 years, and the proportion of 90-day intervals with these bleeding patterns, are summarized in Table 2.

In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.

5.3	Ectopic Pregnancies

As with all progestin-only contraceptive products, be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using NEXPLANON who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain. Although ectopic pregnancies are uncommon among women using NEXPLANON, a pregnancy that occurs in a woman using NEXPLANON may be more likely to be ectopic than a pregnancy occurring in a woman using no contraception.

### Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in iran [^1163hYWT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Results of this study showed, 13.8% of Iranian women experience vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. According to Smiths et al. in a prospective multicenter cohort study (including New Zealand, Australia, UK and Ireland), 23% of women experience vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Another cohort study among 12 centers across the United States revealed that 17.8% of women had vaginal bleeding.

The present research demonstrated that vaginal bleeding has a significant relationship with the demographic characteristics of participants, including age, place of residence, mother's education, history of abortion, interval between pregnancies and physical activity. Also, half of pregnant women with vaginal bleeding had the ages of 26 and 35 years. According to the findings of a New York study, maternal age and vaginal hemorrhage are significantly correlated. According to another study, women over 34 years old had a greater chance of bleeding and miscarriage. With increasing maternal age, the odds of pregnancy problems may rise and then damage to women's uteruses.

The findings of the current study demonstrated a significant association between the place of residence and vaginal bleeding, with higher proportion of the condition among urban women. According to a research by Islam et al. pregnant women in cities experience more complications during pregnancy. Our research also revealed this problem is more common in women who are less physically active. Urban women in this research, in other side, had significantly low level of daily physical activity than rural women (Not shown in the results). There are several benefits of exercise and healthy physical activity for pregnant women, but vaginal bleeding is one of the absolute contraindications to physical activity at this time. Physical activity has a significant role throughout pregnancy, and women should be made aware of this vital requirement. Because of this, they can prevent pregnancy issues by adhering to straightforward fitness guidelines and scaling back their activities if they experience strain. In this crucial time, women's therapy should be taken into account.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114XJg2D]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only contraceptives (implants, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA], and progestin-only pills [POP]) — vaginal bleeding patterns — are classified as follows: irregular pattern without heavy bleeding is category 2 for implant, DMPA, and POP; heavy or prolonged bleeding is category 2 for implant, DMPA, and POP; and unexplained vaginal bleeding (suspicious for serious condition) before evaluation is category 3 for implant and DMPA and category 2 for POP. Clarifications and comments note that irregular bleeding patterns are common with progestin-only contraceptive (POC) use and that implant use might induce irregular bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months; unusually heavy bleeding should raise suspicion for a serious condition; and if pregnancy or an underlying pathological condition is suspected, it must be evaluated and the category adjusted after evaluation, with effects of DMPA potentially persisting after discontinuation.

### Vaginal vault dehiscence after hysterectomy [^111wbqTE]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate factors predisposing vault dehiscence after hysterectomy and its manifestation.

Design

Case series and review of the literature (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).

Setting

Multicenter study.

Patients

Retrospective analysis of 16 unpublished cases of vaginal vault dehiscence after total laparoscopic hysterectomy from physicians who participated in the exchange on the topic of vaginal vault dehiscence at the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists Endo Exchange List (group A) and review of 38 reported cases in the literature (group B).

Interventions

The participating physicians were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire related to vault dehiscence. In addition, we performed literature search using the keywords "vault dehiscence", "vaginal vault dehiscence", "vault prolapse", and "hysterectomy", and conducted the search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Measurements and Main Results

We estimated risk factors and characteristic features for vaginal vault dehiscence. The incidence of vault dehiscence was higher after laparoscopic hysterectomy (1.14%) than after abdominal hysterectomy (0.10%, p < .0001, OR 11.5) and after vaginal hysterectomy (0.14%, p < .001, OR 8.3). The time interval between hysterectomy and occurrence of vault dehiscence in the laparoscopic group (8.4 ± 1.2 weeks) was significantly shorter than in the abdominal hysterectomy (112.7 ± 75.1 weeks, p = .01) and in vaginal hysterectomy (136.5 ± 32.2 weeks, p < .0001) groups, respectively. It appears that sexual intercourse was the main triggering event for vault dehiscence (58.8%). Vaginal bleeding (50%) and vaginal evisceration (48.1%) were the main symptoms.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that vaginal vault dehiscence is rare but may occur more often after laparoscopic hysterectomy than after other hysterectomy approaches. Whether it is related to the technique of laparoscopic suturing is unclear. Other risk factors such as early resumption of regular activities and sexual intercourse may play a role.

5.11 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N = 1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N = 512).

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.12 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion

There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.

5.13 Depression

Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if depression recurs to a serious degree.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^115RVWap]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: All POPs may be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: º Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days. º DRSP POPs: If it has been > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting POPs, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after POPs are initiated and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. The patient should also follow the back-up contraception recommendations for either norethindrone or norgestrel POPs or for DRSP POPs. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs at the time of IUD removal. All POPs may be started immediately after use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA). All POPs may be started no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. The patient should also follow the back-up contraception recommendations for either norethindrone or norgestrel POPs or for DRSP POPs.

### Sexual function in Chinese women from pregnancy to postpartum: a multicenter longitudinal prospective study [^116rNLQY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Participant characteristics

Eventually, a total of 217 participants were involved in the research with an average age of 29.11 years old (SD = 4.21). Demographic and clinical variables were as the follows: age, education level, occupation, monthly income, pre-pregnancy BMI, postpartum weight gain, reproductive history, mode of delivery, and breastfeeding characteristics. Further assessed demographics can be seen in Table 2.

Table 2
Participant Characteristics

Qualitative interview analysis

According to the interview outline (Table 1) of qualitative research, we found that no increase in coital frequency during pregnancy period and also a sharp decline in frequency. The vast majority of pregnant Chinese women tended to stop having vaginal intercourse from the first to third trimester respectively. Thinking of it as relatively beneficial to them for not having vaginal intercourse while she was pregnant. Sex was strictly avoided from the first to the third trimester in particular. Negative influences of having sex on women were as follows: (a) feeling too heavy to move body; (b) pain of pelvis; (c) fatigue or tiredness; (d) discomfort during coitus (e.g. uterine contractions and, dry vaginal mucosa).

The subjects' emotional responses were closely associated with self-perceptions and attitudes toward sexual activities: 1) fear, including (a) the thought that coitus was dangerous which could hurt the fetus; (b) the worry about bleeding, miscarriage, early birth, and vaginal infection. 2) anxiety, including (c) gain in weight, being out of shape and reduction in attraction during pregnancy; (d) partner's incomprehension, which might lead to dissatisfaction with sexual life; (e) instability of marriage. Influenced by social, cultural, and religious factors of China, they seldom took the initiative to discuss about it. The participants tended to get information regarding sexual activity from the Internet and the postpartum women around them. Few of them discussed with their doctors concerning this topic before, nor did they mention the subject actively.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^111yv57r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Xulane) [^111shGGU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough Bleeding or Spotting

In the event of unscheduled or breakthrough bleeding or spotting (bleeding that occurs on the days that Xulane is worn), treatment should be continued. If unscheduled bleeding persists longer than a few cycles, consider causes other than Xulane.

If the woman does not have scheduled or withdrawal bleeding (bleeding that should occur during the patch-free week), she should resume treatment on the next scheduled Change Day. If Xulane has been used correctly, the absence of withdrawal bleeding is not necessarily an indication of pregnancy. Nevertheless, consider the possibility of pregnancy, especially if absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs in 2 consecutive cycles. Discontinue Xulane if pregnancy is confirmed.

In Case of Skin Irritation

If patch use results in uncomfortable irritation, the patch may be removed and a new patch may be applied to a different location until the next Change Day. Only one patch should be worn at a time.

Additional Instructions for Dosing

Unscheduled bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. In case of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, consider nonfunctional causes. In case of undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another method of contraception may solve the problem.

Use of Hormonal Contraceptives in the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period

If the woman has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period. Discontinue use of Xulane if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses one period, she should continue using her contraceptive patches. However, if she has adhered to the prescribed regimen, misses one period and has symptoms associated with pregnancy, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed.

### VTE, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114S9ZbM]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Prevention of VTE in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology — bleeding risk and prophylaxis impact: the estimates of normal blood loss during uncomplicated oocyte retrieval vary, ranging from approximately 230 mL in one prospective cohort of 220 women to 13 mL (range, 0–98 mL) in a study of 830 women; patient-important vaginal bleeding appears to occur in up to 2% to 3% of patients, whereas significant intraabdominal bleeding is much less common (≤ 0.5% procedures). All studies that address the impact of prophylaxis have important limitations, the number of patients who have received anticoagulants is too small to draw conclusions about safety and efficacy, and we rate the quality of evidence as low. In women with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, thromboprophylaxis may result in 26 fewer VTE per 1,000 women treated (number needed to treat [NNT] of 39 given an estimated baseline risk of VTE of 4%), while in women without ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in whom the baseline risk of VTE is estimated to be ~0.2%, the use of LMWH prophylaxis is of very limited value (NNT, 781). Dosage and duration of thromboprophylaxis after assisted reproductive therapy has not been well studied, and if LMWH is used in women who develop ovarian hyperstimulation, extension of prophylaxis for 4 to 8 weeks postresolution of hyperstimulation or throughout any resultant pregnancy and into the postpartum period has been suggested.

### Cervical infections in emergency department patients with vaginal bleeding [^115Uj3Vs]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study has compared the prevalences of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) cervical infection among pregnant and non-pregnant patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with vaginal bleeding.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of these infections in a simultaneously assembled cohort, and to determine whether pregnancy is associated with altered rates of CT or NG cervical infection among patients with vaginal bleeding.

Methods

This was a prospective, seven-month, cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of patients (aged ≥ 15 years) who presented to an urban, teaching ED with the chief complaint of vaginal bleeding. A urine pregnancy test was administered to each patient. Cervical swab specimens were analyzed for CT or NG via polymerase chain reaction technology (DNA probe). The hospital laboratory's baseline 18% rate of positive tests was used for sample size planning. Chisquare analysis and Fisher's exact test, where appropriate, were used to compare pregnant and non-pregnant patient groups.

Results

Cervical infection rates did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant patients. Testing for CT showed that 13 of 114 (11%) of the pregnant patients were positive, while 11 of 147 (8%) non-pregnant patients tested positive (chi(2) = 0.759, p = 0.384). Testing for NG revealed that seven of 114 (6%) pregnant patients tested positive, while 16 of 147 (11%) non-pregnant patients tested positive (chi(2) = 1.256, p = 0.262). Combined testing showed that 18 of 114 (16%) of the pregnant patients and 25 of 147 (17%) of the non-pregnant patients harbored a cervical infection with one or both pathogens (chi(2) = 0.009, p = 0.925).

Conclusions

The prevalence of CT or NG cervical infection in pregnant patients presenting to the ED with vaginal bleeding is 16%. Pregnant and non-pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding are at similar risks for having CT or NG cervical infection. Cervical swab specimens should be obtained in all patients with vaginal bleeding.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^114Giu2U]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Women‐specific bleeding questionnaires

An online survey was sent by e‐mail in May 2019 containing questionnaires and general questions on the prevalence and impact of three themes: (i) HMB, (ii) sexual functioning and (iii) pregnancy, miscarriages and delivery. Participants were also asked to report information on the treatment of bleeding events. Open questions at the end of the survey allowed for additional, personal remarks.

Subjective (self‐reported) HMB was assessed and defined as the need to change pads/tampons more frequently than every 2 h or experiencing bleeding for > 7 days. The self‐reported incidence in the study population was compared to the self‐reported HMB prevalence in the literature. Semi‐objective HMB was assessed through a pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC). A paper version of the PBAC was provided to women who were still menstruating at the time of the study to quantify menstrual blood loss during two consecutive menstrual periods, while continuing any previous HMB treatment. HMB was defined as a PBAC score of > 100 or menstrual cup measurement > 80 mL of blood loss.

The survey included the Menorrhagia Multi‐Attribute Scale (MMAS) and the Revised Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS‐R). The MMAS contained a 5‐point Likert scale specific to women with HMB to assess woman's perception of the consequences of HMB on six domains: family life, physical health, work routine, psychological well‐being, practical problems and social life. Women who had undergone HMB treatment completed this questionnaire twice to obtain a utility score before and after treatment. The FSDS‐R questionnaire was used to measure sexually‐related distress in women: it assesses 13 feelings or problems to determine how often each problem has caused distress in the previous 30 days. A higher scores indicates a higher level of distress, with sexual distress being defined as a FSDS‐R total score of > 11.

A self‐developed questionnaire was used to collect information on bleeding events and treatment during pregnancy, delivery and/or miscarriages.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^116aVqhk]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexual distress

The FSDS‐R to measure sexual‐related distress level was was completed by the 72 women in the analysis group. The six remaining women did not feel comfortable to return a questionnaire about this topic. Sexual distress was reported by 34 of the 72 women. The median (IQR) FSDS‐R score was 10.5 (2.0–22.8). A large proportion of women reported feeling sexually inadequate (17%) or guilty about sexual difficulties (15%) (Fig 2).

Fig 2
Sexual functioning in the total cohort (N = 72).

To test whether the sexual‐related distress within the analysis group was related to the bleeding tendency, we compared the FSDS‐R results with the results from the sexual functioning quetionnaires. The FSDS‐R score was higher in women reporting limitations in sexual activity due to their bleeding tendency (27 women), compared to women without self‐reported limitations (40), with a median (IQR) FSDS‐R score of 20 (8–26) versus 6 (1–14) (P = 0.002).

Pregnancy and delivery

Miscarriages were reported by 23 women, of which 18 women reported to have experienced heavy blood loss due to miscarriage. In all, 12 women reported having received treatment for blood loss caused by miscarriage (four, iron tablets; two, hormonal treatment; three, tranexamic acid; one, desmopressin; two, clotting factors; nine, curettage; three, platelets transfusion; two, blood transfusion). Three of these women reported an emergency hospital visit and treatment.

Of the analysis group, a total of 138 live infants (117 vaginal deliveries, 21 caesarean sections) were born to 58 women. Women with a confirmed CPD more often delivered via caesarean section than women suspected of a CPD (24% vs. 11%, P = 0.04). Bleeding problems were reported by 81% (47/58) of the women in one or more deliveries. These bleeding problems were reported to require treatment in at least 62% (29/47) of women (eight with unknown treatment are reported here as having no treatment received). Tranexamic acid and iron treatment were most often prescribed, followed by blood and platelet transfusion.

### Endometrial injury for pregnancy following sexual intercourse or intrauterine insemination [^1149PeE8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intentional endometrial injury is currently being proposed as a technique to improve the probability of pregnancy in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Endometrial injury is often performed by pipelle biopsy or a similar technique, and is a common, simple, gynaecological procedure that has an established safety profile. However, it is also known to be associated with a moderate degree of discomfort/pain and requires an additional pelvic examination. The effectiveness of this procedure outside of ART, in women or couples attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse or with low complexity fertility treatments such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) and ovulation induction (OI), remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intentional endometrial injury in subfertile women and couples attempting to conceive through sexual intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gyanecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, ISI Web of Knowledge and ClinicalTrials.gov; as well as reference lists of relevant reviews and included studies. We performed the searches from inception to 31 October 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any kind of intentional endometrial injury in women planning to undergo IUI or attempting to conceive spontaneously (with or without OI) compared to no intervention, a mock intervention or intentional endometrial injury performed at a different time or to a higher/lower degree.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed trial quality using GRADE methodology. The primary outcomes were live birth/ongoing pregnancy and pain experienced during the procedure. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and bleeding secondary to the procedure. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic.

Main Results

Nine trials, which included a total of 1512 women, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. Most of these studies included women with unexplained infertility. In seven studies the women were undergoing IUI and in two studies the women were trying to conceive from sexual intercourse. Eight trials compared intentional endometrial injury with no injury/placebo procedure; of these two trials also compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with intentional endometrial injury in the IUI cycle. One trial compared higher vs. lower degree of intentional endometrial injury. Intentional endometrial injury vs. either no intervention or a sham procedureWe are uncertain whether endometrial injury improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low (risk ratio (RR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 3.15; six RCTs, 950 participants; I² statistic = 0%, very low quality evidence). When we restricted the analysis to only studies at low risk of bias the effect was imprecise and the evidence remained of very low quality (RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.82; one RCT, 105 participants; very low quality evidence). Endometrial injury may improve clinical pregnancy rates however the evidence is of low quality (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.58; eight RCTs, 1180 participants; I² statistic = 0%, low quality evidence). The average pain experienced by participants undergoing endometrial injury was 6/10 on a zero-10 visual analogue scale (VAS)(standard deviation = 1.5). However, only one study reported this outcome. Higher vs. lower degree of intentional endometrial injuryWhen we compared hysteroscopy with endometrial injury to hysteroscopy alone, there was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.35; one RCT, 332 participants; low quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.01; one RCT, 332 participants, low quality evidence). This study did not report the primary outcome of pain during the procedure. Timing of intentional endometrial injuryWhen endometrial injury was performed in the cycle prior to IUI compared to the same cycle as the IUI, there was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.16, one RCT, 176 participants; very low quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.36; two RCTs, 276 participants; very low quality evidence). Neither of these studies reported the primary outcome of pain during the procedure. In all three comparisons there was no evidence of an effect on miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or multiple pregnancy. No studies reported bleeding secondary to the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

It is uncertain whether endometrial injury improves the probability of pregnancy and live birth/ongoing pregnancy in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution as we graded the quality of the evidence as either low or very low. The main reasons we downgraded the quality of the evidence were most included studies were at a high risk of bias and had an overall low level of precision. Further well-conducted RCTs that recruit large numbers of participants and minimise internal bias are required to confirm or refute these findings.

### What do we know about why women bleed and what do we not know? [^1178KGzJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Women or people with a uterus are vulnerable to both normal and abnormal bleeding. During the reproductive years, the uterus is prepared physiologically to accept an embryo and support its growth and development during pregnancy, or in the absence of implantation of an embryo, recycle through the process of menstruation and accept an embryo a month or so later. If fertilization takes place and an embryo or embryos implant in the uterus, the fetal trophoblast, or outer cell layer of the embryo, invades and dilates the maternal spiral arteries and forms the placenta. No matter when in gestation a pregnancy ends, at the conclusion of pregnancy, the placenta should separate from the wall of the uterus and be expelled. Abnormal bleeding occurs during pregnancy or after delivery when the normal uteroplacental interface has not been established or is interrupted; during miscarriage; during ectopic pregnancy; during premature separation of the placenta; or during postpartum hemorrhage. Heavy menstrual bleeding, a subset of abnormal menstrual bleeding, can be quantitatively defined as > 80 mL of blood loss per cycle. Unlike postpartum hemorrhage, heavy menstrual bleeding is significantly associated with an underlying bleeding disorder. While there is other reproductive tract bleeding in women, notably bleeding at the time of ovulation or with a life-threatening ruptured ectopic pregnancy, the unique bleeding that women experience is predominantly uterine in origin. Many of the unique aspects of uterine hemostasis, however, remain unknown.

### Vaginal postcoital injuries requiring surgical intervention: a case series and literature review [^1129Fmh4]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

This case series describes clinical features and management of women who required surgical repair of vaginal injuries following consensual intercourse in our institution during the last decade. As a secondary aim, we reviewed the literature on the topic. We searched our institution's database for procedures coded as "Suture of Vagina", excluding trauma not related to consensual sexual activity: between January 2008 and December 2017, 20 women underwent hemostatic suturing for vaginal injuries following intercourse. Mean age was 27.6 ± 12.5 (range, 16–63) years, 5 (25%) women were parous, 13 (65%) women used no contraception, and 1 (5%) used birth control pills. Three patients (15%) were postmenopausal. Eight injuries (40%) occurred following first-time intercourse, two (10%) occurred after intercourse with a new partner. Median time from bleeding onset to admission was 12 (range, 2–24)h. One patient (5%) was hemodynamically unstable and required treatment with packed cells. Median time from admission to surgery was 56 (range, 15–540)min. The laceration site was identified at the vaginal fornix in nine (45%) patients, at mid-vagina in four (20%), at the hymenal ring, or the posterior fourchette in six (30%). Tear of a longitudinal vaginal septum was identified in one patient (5%). To conclude, vaginal postcoital injuries are a rare occurrence, nevertheless they may involve significant blood loss and therefore require prompt evaluation and treatment. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, psychosexual assessment and support should be offered to the patient and her partner.

### Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in iran [^11742nHW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although, a declining trend of vaginal bleeding was found but it increases the risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight in Iranian pregnant women. Considering these results and the high risk of these women with VB for adverse complications, they need better care and counseling during pregnancy. Furthermore, there should be excellent training and emphasis for medical professionals to treat all women with a history of vaginal bleeding as high-risk pregnancies and to adopt a more serious approach to their care during pregnancy and labor.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115qHe4T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 25% of pregnant women experience bleeding in the early stage, and half of them eventually progress to pregnancy loss. Currently, neither effective treatment nor prevention strategy is available to manage this condition. Despite some medicines are frequently prescribed in clinical practice including progesterone, the latter seems only to benefit early pregnant women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and vaginal bleeding.

The vaginal bleeding during the early pregnancy stage is proven to be strongly associated with miscarriage, which is indeed attributed to luteal insufficiency, leading to low progesterone concentration. Progesterone, a critical hormone during pregnancy, reflects the luteal function until 7 weeks of gestation, and thus serves as a biomarker to predict the pregnancy outcome in threatened miscarriage. However, the concentration of progesterone varies largely among individuals and across gestational age. Previously, two meta-analyses indicated that both less than 10 ng/mL and 6.3 ng/mL could predict a non-viable pregnancy in early pregnant women including threatened miscarriage. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether a single progesterone measurement can predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, because most of studies recruited mixed patients including biochemical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and threatened miscarriage.

Therefore, we conduct a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of single progesterone measurement predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage.

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^115ig1Ri]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.8 Bleeding Pattern Alterations

LILETTA can alter the bleeding pattern and result in spotting, irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea. During the first three to six months of LILETTA use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may increase and irregular bleeding patterns may develop. Thereafter, the number of bleeding and spotting days usually decreases but bleeding may remain irregular.

Contraception Study

The amenorrhea rates observed in the LILETTA clinical study on contraception are shown in Table 2. The bleeding and spotting days, based on 28-day cycle equivalents, are shown in Table 3. In this study, 2.5% of participants discontinued LILETTA due to bleeding complaints.

*Amenorrhea is defined as no bleeding and/or spotting.

*N includes all LILETTA participants in the clinical study on contraception.

Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Study

The amenorrhea rates observed in the LILETTA clinical study on heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) are shown in Table 4. Amenorrhea developed in 19% of LILETTA study participants by Cycle 6.

*Amenorrhea is defined as no bleeding and/or spotting. Percentages within each cycle are based on the number of participants who completed the cycle.

The bleeding and spotting days, based on 28-day cycle equivalents, are shown in Table 5. In this study, 3.8% of LILETTA participants discontinued due to bleeding complaints.

*N includes participants with at least one complete 28-day cycle of product-use. Calculations are based on complete 28-day cycles (at least 23 days in length).

Resumption of Menses After Discontinuation

In the LILETTA clinical study on contraception, 651 of 652 (99.8%) participants 16–35 years of age at enrollment that were evaluated resumed menses after LILETTA removal. This excludes twelve participants (9 became pregnant, 2 had a hysterectomy, and 1 had ovulatory dysfunction).

Other Bleeding Pattern Changes

If a significant change in bleeding develops during prolonged use, conduct diagnostic tests to assess possible endometrial pathology. Consider the possibility of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, if menstruation does not occur within six weeks of the onset of a previous menstruation. After excluding pregnancy, repeat pregnancy tests are generally not necessary in amenorrheic patients unless indicated by other signs of pregnancy or pelvic pain.

The first and foremost diagnosis to exclude in the pregnant patient presenting with vaginal bleeding is ectopic pregnancy. Once ectopic pregnancy is ruled out, miscarriage should be considered as a clinical spectrum. Its management is directed according to the integrity of the internal cervical os and patient hemodynamic status. Treatment with anti-D immune globulin is warranted for all Rh-negative patients. Urgent obstetric consultation is necessary for most miscarriage presentations.

Society of Family Planning — Non-hormonal contraception (Table 1): Copper T intrauterine device (IUD) offers Effectiveness (in cisgender women): 99.2%. Can be used within five days of unprotected intercourse as emergency contraception. Vaginal atrophy can occur after long-term gender-affirming testosterone administration; for patient comfort, consider pre-treating patients with vaginal estrogen two weeks prior to placement. Consider offering to have the patient place the speculum to minimize discomfort. Cramping after placement may feel similar to menstrual cramps and may lead to feelings of distress for some patients, and bleeding can be prevented or treated using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tranexamic acid. Although endometrial atrophy can occur after long-term gender-affirming testosterone administration, there is no evidence of myometrial changes so risk of uterine perforation is likely unchanged due to testosterone alone.

5.11	Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N = 1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N = 512).

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.12	Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion

There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods — reproductive tract conditions: Irregular vaginal bleeding is Delay for both symptoms-based and calendar-based methods, and because this makes FAB methods unreliable, barrier methods should be recommended until the bleeding pattern is compatible with proper method use, with evaluation and treatment as necessary. Vaginal discharge is Delay for symptoms-based and Accept for calendar-based methods, and because it makes recognition of cervical secretions difficult, the condition should be evaluated and treated if needed before providing methods based on cervical secretions.

### Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy [^112sJX2j]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bleeding in late-term pregnancy can present as an innocuous start to parturition or a catastrophic maternal-fetal hemorrhage masked by the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy. The emergency management of late-term bleeding can be challenging, especially when providing stabilizing care in a limited-resource environment. Early recognition of life-threatening vaginal bleeding, potential causes, and emergency management of maternal-fetal distress is reviewed. Maternal resuscitation with balanced versus targeted blood products replacement is presented for low-resource versus high-resource environments. Emergency department readiness for such a patient, in combination with appropriate consultation or transfer, is essential to the effective management of late-term vaginal bleeding.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® second and third trimester vaginal bleeding [^116xsbf6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding can occur throughout pregnancy with varied etiologies. Although history and physical examination can identify many etiologies, imaging, in particular ultrasound (US), is the backbone of current medical practice. US pregnant uterus transabdominal, US pregnant uterus transvaginal, and US duplex Doppler velocimetry are usually appropriate for the evaluation of women with painless vaginal bleeding, those with painful vaginal bleeding, and also for those with second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. US cervix transperineal may be appropriate for those with painless or painful vaginal bleeding but is usually not appropriate for second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. Because the outcome of pregnancies is unequivocally related to the specific etiology of the vaginal bleeding, knowledge of imaging results directly informs patient management to optimize the outcome for mother and fetus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Daysee) [^117BukHA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Women using Daysee may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Daysee, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of Daysee subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.

Figure 2: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding

If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Daysee may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

After discontinuation of Daysee, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1153BBLi]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

CHCs contain both estrogen and a progestin and include COCs (various formulations), combined transdermal patches, and combined vaginal rings. Approximately seven out of 100 CHC users become pregnant in the first year with typical use. These methods are reversible and can be used by patients of all ages. Combined hormonal contraceptives are generally used for 21–24 consecutive days, followed by 4–7 hormone-free days (either no use or placebo pills). These methods are sometimes used for an extended period with infrequent or no hormone-free days. CHCs do not protect against STIs, including HIV infection, and patients using CHCs should be counseled that consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited. Patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

Initiation of CHCs

Timing

CHCs may be initiated at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

If CHCs are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed.
If CHCs are started > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Special Considerations

Amenorrhea (Not Postpartum)

Timing: CHCs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Conditions that often present with vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks are common and can cause morbidity and mortality. Clinically stable patients can choose their management options. Clinically unstable patients require urgent procedural management: uterine aspiration, dilation and evacuation, or surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy. Septic abortion requires prompt procedural management, intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous fluids. Available data on prognosis with expectant management of pre-viable rupture of membranes in the United States are poor for mothers and fetuses.

Box 7-C — important topics when informing persons with HIV about how to prevent transmission of HIV to others — highlights topics related to sexual transmission, including communicating with partners to foster healthy sexuality. Methods that HIV-discordant couples can use to reduce the risk of sexual HIV transmission include using latex and polyurethane male and female condoms: negotiating with partner to use; reminders to use; correct and consistent use, using dental dams or other physical barriers while having oral-vaginal or oral-rectal sex, and using sexual positioning that lowers a partner's risk of acquiring HIV (order from lowest to highest risk: insertive fellatio, receptive fellatio, insertive penile-vaginal sex, receptive penile-vaginal sex, insertive anal sex, receptive anal sex). Additional measures include avoiding sexual intercourse with HIV-infected persons after invasive anal or genital procedures until healing is complete; or when anal or genital bleeding, inflammation, or trauma may be present (e.g., if infected with STD or when using irritating sexual aids), using only water-based spermicides and lubricants that do not contain nonoxynol-9, and reducing the number of sex partners. Risk discussions also include the presence of symptomatic or asymptomatic STD in HIV-uninfected partners, which may increase their risk of acquiring HIV and may indicate a substantial risk for HIV that is a clinical indication for PrEP, evidence that male circumcision may reduce a man's risk of acquiring HIV from a female partner with HIV, methods to prevent unintended pregnancy, and conception options that reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.12 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion

There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.

### A randomized trial of progesterone in women with bleeding in early pregnancy [^111CyWcM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bleeding in early pregnancy is strongly associated with pregnancy loss. Progesterone is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. Several small trials have suggested that progesterone therapy may improve pregnancy outcomes in women who have bleeding in early pregnancy.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate progesterone, as compared with placebo, in women with vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. Women were randomly assigned to receive vaginal suppositories containing either 400 mg of progesterone or matching placebo twice daily, from the time at which they presented with bleeding through 16 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was the birth of a live-born baby after at least 34 weeks of gestation. The primary analysis was performed in all participants for whom data on the primary outcome were available. A sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome that included all the participants was performed with the use of multiple imputation to account for missing data.

Results

A total of 4153 women, recruited at 48 hospitals in the United Kingdom, were randomly assigned to receive progesterone (2079 women) or placebo (2074 women). The percentage of women with available data for the primary outcome was 97% (4038 of 4153 women). The incidence of live births after at least 34 weeks of gestation was 75% (1513 of 2025 women) in the progesterone group and 72% (1459 of 2013 women) in the placebo group (relative rate, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.07; P = 0.08). The sensitivity analysis, in which missing primary outcome data were imputed, resulted in a similar finding (relative rate, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.07; P = 0.08). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups.

Conclusions

Among women with bleeding in early pregnancy, progesterone therapy administered during the first trimester did not result in a significantly higher incidence of live births than placebo.

Management of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD user is found to be pregnant — general guidance: Evaluate for possible ectopic pregnancy, and advise that there is an increased risk for spontaneous abortion (including septic abortion that might be life threatening) and for preterm delivery if the IUD is left in place; removal of the IUD reduces these risks but might not decrease the risk to the baseline level of a pregnancy without an IUD. If the patient does not want to continue the pregnancy, counsel about options, and if the patient wants to continue the pregnancy, advise them to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.

Special considerations during pregnancy — cervical screening, procedures, and delivery planning in HIV and HPV: Pregnant women should undergo cervical cancer screening as recommended above for non-pregnant women, and cytobrush sampling can be done during pregnancy. Pregnant women with abnormal cervical cytology results should undergo colposcopy and cervical biopsy of lesions suspicious for high-grade disease or cancer (BIII), increased bleeding may occur with cervical biopsy during pregnancy, and endocervical curettage is contraindicated in pregnant women (AIII). Pregnant women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) can be managed the same as non-pregnant women, although deferral of colposcopy until at least 6 weeks postpartum is recommended (CIII). Treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is not recommended during pregnancy unless invasive disease is suspected, pregnant women with suspected cervical cancer should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for definitive diagnosis, treatment, and development of a delivery plan, and vaginal delivery is not recommended for women with invasive cervical cancer.

Pregnancy termination — HIV-infected women: One study in the narrative review found that HIV-infected women do not have a higher prevalence of postabortion complications after medically attended surgical abortion than HIV-uninfected women, supporting the recommendation to inform HIV-infected women considering medically attended pregnancy termination that available evidence indicates HIV infection does not increase the risk of complications after the procedure; women with HIV who undergo termination procedures should defer vaginal sexual contact until bleeding has ceased and healing is complete to lower the risk of HIV transmission to others.

Postpartum (Nonbreastfeeding)

Timing: All POPs may be started at any time, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: If the patient is < 21 days postpartum, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. º Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: A patient who is ≥ 21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days. If the patient's menstrual cycle has returned and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days. º DRSP POPs: A patient who is ≥ 21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. If the patient's menstrual cycle has returned and it has been > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)

Timing: All POPs may be started at any time postabortion, including immediately after abortion completion, if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3), or at the time of medication abortion initiation (U.S. MEC 1).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days for norethindrone or norgestrel POPs or for the next 7 days for DRSP POPs, unless POPs are started at the time of an abortion.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: The first DMPA injection may be administered immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: If it has been > 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting DMPA, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the injection and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

### Self-induced medical abortion in an adolescent [^111Saasi]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Case Report

An 18-yr-old female presented to her local pediatric clinic with a 4-day history of vaginal bleeding and cramping. She reported sexual activity with last coitus two weeks prior and intermittent condom usage. Examination revealed blood in the vaginal vault and a 4- to 5-cm uterus, slightly tender to palpation. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was positive. She reported having taken "four little white pills" from a friend, prior to onset of bleeding, "so that she would not be pregnant". Further questioning revealed that the pills were misoprostol. An ultrasound demonstrated no intrauterine or tubal pregnancy. The patient was followed; her bleeding resolved over two weeks and her ss-hCG levels declined steadily.

Discussion

There are some studies in the adult literature that address medical self-induction of abortion, and sporadic reports on the Internet and in the lay press. No pediatric literature has been published on this topic in the United States. It is important for clinicians to be aware that such an option exists for pregnant young women when evaluating an adolescent who presents with vaginal bleeding and cramping.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: The implant may be placed immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting the implant, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the implant is placed and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting the implant likely exceed any risk. Therefore, starting the implant should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an implant from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after implant placement. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting the ENG implant at different times of the cycle.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaFirst trimester vaginal bleeding [^113dWHe4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is not uncommon in the first trimester of pregnancy. The majority of such patients will have a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, or an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality in evaluation of these patients. US, along with clinical observations and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, can usually distinguish these causes. Although it is important to diagnose ectopic pregnancies and nonviable IUPs, one should also guard against injury to normal pregnancies due to inappropriate treatment with methotrexate or surgical intervention. Less common causes of first trimester vaginal bleeding include gestational trophoblastic disease and arteriovenous malformations. Pulsed methods of Doppler US should generally be avoided in the first trimester when there is a normal, or a potentially normal, IUP. Once a normal IUP has been excluded, Doppler US may be useful when other diagnoses such as retained products of conception or arteriovenous malformations are suspected. MRI may occasionally be helpful as a problem-solving tool. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: CHCs may be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting CHCs, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after CHCs are initiated and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs at the time of IUD removal. CHCs may be started immediately after use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA). CHCs may be started no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117N1ahT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria — Intrauterine devices (IUDs): for vaginal bleeding patterns, irregular pattern without heavy bleeding has Cu-IUD initiation 1 and continuation 1, and LNG-IUD initiation 1 and continuation 1; heavy or prolonged bleeding (includes regular and irregular patterns) has Cu-IUD initiation 2 and continuation 1, and LNG-IUD initiation 1 and continuation 2; unexplained vaginal bleeding (suspicious for serious condition) before evaluation has Cu-IUD initiation 4 and continuation 2, and LNG-IUD initiation 4 and continuation 2. Clarifications state that unusually heavy bleeding should raise suspicion of a serious underlying condition, and if pregnancy or an underlying pathologic condition is suspected, it must be evaluated and the category adjusted after evaluation, and the IUD does not need to be removed before evaluation. Evidence notes that among women with heavy or prolonged bleeding, LNG-IUD use reported no increase in adverse effects and was beneficial in treating menorrhagia.

### Von Willebrand disease and other bleeding disorders in women: consensus on diagnosis and management from an international expert panel [^112nicKH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Reproductive tract bleeding in women is a naturally occurring event during menstruation and childbirth. In women with menorrhagia, however, congenital bleeding disorders historically have been underdiagnosed. This consensus is intended to allow physicians to better recognize bleeding disorders as a cause of menorrhagia and consequently offer effective disease-specific therapies.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114yuXVu]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)

Timing: The LNG-IUD may be placed at any time postabortion, including immediately after abortion completion (U.S. MEC 1 or 2), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). The LNG-IUD should not be placed immediately after a septic abortion (U.S. MEC 4).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days unless the IUD is placed immediately after abortion completion.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: The LNG-IUD may be placed immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: If it has been > 7 days since menstrual bleeding began, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from a Cu-IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting the LNG-IUD, there might be additional concerns when switching from a Cu-IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider providing any type of ECP at the time of LNG-IUD placement to address the potential for residual sperm.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the patient should be offered a contraceptive method other than an IUD to use until the health care provider can be reasonably certain that they are not pregnant and can place the LNG-IUD. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an LNG-IUD from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after LNG-IUD placement. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of placing LNG-IUDs on different days of the cycle on short- or long-term outcomes.
