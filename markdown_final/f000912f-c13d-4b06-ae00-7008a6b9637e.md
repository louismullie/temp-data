## Question

A 30-year-old patient is hospitalized for left knee arthritis. He is allergic to penicillin. What are the precautions for medication?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication precautions for managing a 30-year-old hospitalized patient with left knee arthritis and a reported penicillin allergy, including risk stratification, cross-reactivity, perioperative prophylaxis, and stewardship considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and whether this is native septic arthritis versus inflammatory arthritis or post-arthroplasty infection. Then, I should verify the nature of the reported penicillin allergy and risk-stratify it. Next, I will examine cross-reactivity within β-lactams and how that informs safe alternatives. After that, I need to consider perioperative prophylaxis if arthroplasty is planned, including cefazolin safety and when to avoid β-lactams. Finally, I should review stewardship, testing/delabeling, and special scenarios like carbapenems or aztreonam, and close with a practical decision framework and documentation plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because management diverges substantially if this is native joint septic arthritis versus inflammatory arthritis or a prosthetic joint. Wait, let me verify the guideline anchors: for native joint septic arthritis, empiric therapy should cover Staphylococcus aureus, typically with a first-generation cephalosporin or an anti-staphylococcal penicillin, whereas for inflammatory arthritis management focuses on disease-modifying therapy rather than antibiotics; if this is post-arthroplasty, perioperative infection prevention principles and prophylaxis choices matter, so I need to keep both pathways in mind until the diagnosis is clarified [^115kYTJi] [^1127zHFQ].

> Next, I should review the reported penicillin allergy carefully and risk-stratify it, because most labels are inaccurate and risk drives safe β-lactam use. I need to check whether the reaction was immediate (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) versus non-immediate (morbilliform rash, GI upset), how long ago it occurred, and whether there has been subsequent β-lactam exposure; importantly, up to 10% report penicillin allergy, but fewer than 5% are truly allergic, and most lose sensitization over time, which supports proactive delabeling when appropriate [^115Y2pUS] [^115qYXBM] [^117MJekD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about avoiding all β-lactams; I should confirm cross-reactivity patterns. Modern data show penicillin–cephalosporin cross-reactivity is about 2% overall, far lower than the historical 8–10%, and is largely driven by R1 side-chain similarity; cefazolin has a unique side chain and very low cross-reactivity, making it the preferred perioperative agent even in many patients with a reported penicillin allergy, especially if the history is non-anaphylactic [^112XeHaw] [^117XfV6o] [^112S9xZG].

> For low-risk histories (remote, non-urticarial rash or benign GI symptoms), I should double-check whether a direct oral amoxicillin challenge is appropriate; yes, guidelines endorse direct challenge without prior skin testing in low-risk adults to expedite delabeling and restore first-line options, given the high negative predictive value of compatible histories and the minimal reaction risk in this phenotype [^1136cv2U] [^111amMUy] [^115Y2pUS].

> For moderate-risk histories (urticaria without anaphylaxis), let me consider penicillin skin testing followed by a supervised oral challenge if negative; I should confirm that skin testing has an excellent negative predictive value exceeding 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge, which safely enables β-lactam use thereafter [^115Y2pUS] [^1167fAAy].

> For high-risk histories (anaphylaxis, recent IgE-mediated reaction, or multiple β-lactam allergies), I need to ensure we avoid direct β-lactam challenge and instead use non–cross-reactive alternatives or pursue specialist-guided strategies; in this scenario, cefazolin may still be reasonable if the reaction was non-anaphylactic and the side chain is dissimilar, but if there was penicillin anaphylaxis, I should confirm that contemporary guidance allows cefazolin without prior testing due to its unique side chain, while maintaining readiness to treat reactions [^116GdV5n] [^112S9xZG] [^116QU3xv].

> Now, regarding perioperative prophylaxis if total knee arthroplasty is planned, I should verify that cefazolin remains first-line and that patients with a reported penicillin allergy can often still receive it safely. Multiple series show very low reaction rates (approximately 0.1–0.2%) when cefazolin is given to patients with a reported penicillin allergy, and stewardship interventions that risk-stratify and prefer cefazolin increase first-line use without increasing allergic events; moreover, avoiding cefazolin is associated with higher infection risk, so I should favor cefazolin unless the allergy history is high-risk or there is a specific cephalosporin contraindication [^115QEy9w] [^112szDKe] [^117DF3Np] [^113o9UXs].

> But wait, what if β-lactams are truly contraindicated or the patient is high risk; I should review non–β-lactam options and their trade-offs. Vancomycin monotherapy is commonly used but offers narrower gram-negative coverage and may be associated with higher infection rates in some cohorts; clindamycin is an alternative with activity against staphylococci but lacks gram-negative coverage and carries C. difficile risk; if a β-lactam is essential, carbapenems have extremely low cross-reactivity with penicillins and can generally be used without prior testing, and aztreonam lacks cross-reactivity except with ceftazidime and is a reasonable option when gram-negative coverage is prioritized [^114UpMZT] [^115sXZna] [^114YP4n6] [^1117bKEo].

> I should confirm the role of proactive delabeling and testing programs because they change real-world outcomes. Institutions that implement allergy screening, risk stratification, and direct challenges safely expand β-lactam use, reduce second-line agents, and lower downstream infections and costs; AAAAI recommends proactive delabeling when appropriate, and ASPs should promote allergy assessments to restore first-line therapy [^117MJekD] [^112szDKe] [^1153SEnk] [^115wKYFd].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with guidelines. If the penicillin allergy is low risk, proceed with direct amoxicillin challenge or use cefazolin for prophylaxis; if moderate risk, perform penicillin skin testing and, if negative, give amoxicillin or cefazolin; if high risk, avoid direct β-lactam challenge, consider cefazolin only if non-anaphylactic and side chain is dissimilar, otherwise use vancomycin or clindamycin with awareness of coverage gaps, and reserve carbapenems or aztreonam for complex infections when benefits outweigh risks; throughout, document reaction details, testing results, and a delabeling plan to support future care [^112S9xZG] [^115Y2pUS] [^1136cv2U].

> Finally, I need to ensure the immediate next steps are explicit. I should clarify whether this is native septic arthritis requiring empiric anti-staphylococcal therapy or inflammatory arthritis needing rheumatologic management; if septic arthritis is suspected, I would start empiric cefazolin unless there is a convincing history of anaphylaxis to penicillins, monitor closely for reactions, and adjust therapy to culture results; if arthroplasty is planned, I would risk-stratify the allergy, prefer cefazolin for most, and only deviate to vancomycin or clindamycin if truly indicated, documenting the rationale and updating the allergy label based on observed tolerance or formal testing results [^115kYTJi] [^1127zHFQ] [^115Y2pUS].

---

For a 30-year-old with left knee arthritis and a penicillin allergy, **avoid all penicillins** [^114pmnsz] and use **cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains** (e.g. cefazolin) [^112XeHaw] if the reaction was non-anaphylactic; if anaphylaxis occurred, use non–beta-lactam alternatives (e.g. vancomycin, clindamycin, aztreonam) [^114UpMZT] [^1117bKEo]. Document the allergy clearly [^112vP8gX], monitor for reactions, and consider penicillin allergy testing [^1135ZxjZ] to enable safer future antibiotic use [^115wKYFd].

## Precautions for medication administration

### General precautions

- **Avoidance of penicillins**: Strictly avoid all penicillin-class antibiotics, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin G, and penicillin V [^114pmnsz] [^1165Qd3X].

- **Documentation**: Clearly document the allergy in the medical record, including the specific reaction and severity [^112vP8gX].

- **Patient education**: Educate the patient about the allergy and ensure they inform all healthcare providers [^1125ShBB].

---

### Alternative antibiotic options

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Precautions and considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Cephalosporins | - Cefazolin <br/> - Cefuroxime <br/> - Ceftriaxone | - Use cautiously; **cross-reactivity is low (≤ 2%)** [^117XfV6o] <br/> - Preferred for **non-anaphylactic reactions** [^notfound] <br/> - Avoid in **anaphylactic reactions** [^notfound] |
| Carbapenems | - Meropenem <br/> - Imipenem | - Low cross-reactivity (< 1%) [^114YP4n6] <br/> - Safe for most patients with penicillin allergy [^115cAsWQ] |
| Monobactams | Aztreonam | - No cross-reactivity with penicillins [^1117bKEo] <br/> - Safe alternative [^114cHE93] |
| Non-beta-lactam antibiotics | - Vancomycin <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - Macrolides (azithromycin) | - No cross-reactivity <br/> - Suitable for severe penicillin allergies [^114UpMZT] |

---

### Specific precautions for arthroplasty patients

- **Perioperative prophylaxis**: Cefazolin is the preferred prophylactic antibiotic for arthroplasty, even in patients with non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy [^112szDKe].

- **Anaphylactic reactions**: For patients with a history of anaphylaxis, avoid beta-lactam antibiotics and use non-beta-lactam alternatives (e.g. vancomycin, clindamycin) [^114UpMZT].

- **Monitoring**: Monitor closely for allergic reactions during antibiotic administration, especially if using beta-lactam alternatives [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Risk stratification**: Use a risk-based approach to classify patients as low, moderate, or high risk based on their allergy history [^1144dDpB].

- **Testing and delabeling**: Consider penicillin allergy testing and delabeling in appropriate patients to expand antibiotic options and improve outcomes [^117MJekD] [^115wKYFd].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Promote the use of first-line antibiotics when safe, to reduce the risk of infections and antibiotic resistance [^113o9UXs].

---

## Potential complications of inappropriate antibiotic use

- **Increased infection risk**: Use of second-line antibiotics (e.g. vancomycin, clindamycin) is associated with higher rates of surgical site infections and prosthetic joint infections [^115uPo2Y] [^113o9UXs].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Inappropriate antibiotic selection can promote resistance, complicating future infections [^115Y2pUS].

- **Adverse effects**: Second-line antibiotics often have higher rates of adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal complications [^114UpMZT] [^115wKYFd].

---

## Summary of precautions

- **Avoid penicillins**: Strictly avoid all penicillin-class antibiotics [^114pmnsz].

- **Use alternatives**: Prefer cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains for non-anaphylactic reactions; use non-beta-lactam alternatives for anaphylactic reactions [^112XeHaw].

- **Document clearly**: Ensure the allergy is well-documented and communicated [^112vP8gX].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for allergic reactions during antibiotic administration [^1125ShBB].

- **Consider testing**: Evaluate for penicillin allergy testing and delabeling when appropriate [^1135ZxjZ].

---

Patients with a penicillin allergy require **careful selection of alternative antibiotics** [^112S9xZG] and close monitoring. Cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains are generally safe for non-anaphylactic reactions, while non-beta-lactam alternatives are preferred for anaphylactic reactions. Clear documentation, patient education, and consideration of allergy testing are essential to optimize treatment and reduce complications [^115wKYFd].

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

Although there are numerous nonpatient-related factors that may help reduce infection risk, the proper use of prophylactic antibiotics is most responsible for reducing infection. The role of prophylactic antibiotics is to reduce early periprosthetic joint replacement, which is accomplished by having adequate antibiotic tissue levels at the time of skin incision. The goal of this section of the symposium is to review current antibiotic recommendations, how to manage patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy, review the use of dual antibiotics, discuss the use of antibiotics in the outpatient total joint setting, as well as very briefly discuss the administration of intraosseous antibiotics in knee arthroplasty.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

PRECAUTIONS

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma.

General

Prescribing penicillin-VK in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm, or intestinal hypermotility.

Occasional patients will not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered penicillin.

In streptococcal infections, therapy must be sufficient to eliminate the organism (10-day minimum); otherwise the sequelae of streptococcal disease may occur. Cultures should be taken following completion of treatment to determine whether streptococci have been eradicated.

Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including penicillin-VK should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When penicillin-VK is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by penicillin-VK or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^116QR2zJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy to cephalosporin administration — We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified (not confirmed) nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Moderate. Given that < 5% of patients with an unverified penicillin allergy are truly allergic, and ~2% of those who are truly allergic will experience a reaction to a cephalosporin, when they are given cephalosporins directly, the chance of a reaction is very low with a linked probability of ~0.1% (ie, 0.05 × 0.02 = 0.001). Retrospective studies of parenteral cephalosporin administration to patients with a history of penicillin allergy, without prior penicillin skin testing, have shown rare cephalosporin allergic reactions.

Antimicrobial agents — penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^116T5Kx1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Penicillin testing result and aminopenicillin-specific considerations — If penicillin testing is negative, the patient can receive any cephalosporin without special precaution. Patients who are proven to be aminopenicillin-allergic should generally avoid cephalosporins with identical R1-group side chains. From 12% to 38% of patients with penicillin allergy in Europe are proven to be selectively allergic to aminopenicillins (ie, able to tolerate penicillin but not amoxicillin/ampicillin), the prevalence of aminopenicillin allergy in the United States appears to be rare.

### Is penicillin allergy a clinical problem? A systematic review of total joint arthroplasty procedures with implications for patient safety and antibiotic stewardship [^117DF3Np]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) who report penicillin allergy (PA) are frequently administered second-line antibiotics, although recent evidence suggests that this may be unnecessary and could increase infection risk. Many institutions have aimed to improve antibiotic deployment via allergy testing and screening; however, there is little standardization to this process. This review aimed to evaluate (1) antibiotic selection in patients who report PA and assess the impact of screening and testing interventions, (2) rates of allergic reactions in patients who report PA, and (3) the association between reported PA and screening or testing programs and odds of surgical site infection or periprosthetic joint infection.

Methods

PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar electronic databases were searched on February 4, 2023 to identify all studies published since January 1, 2000 that evaluated the impact of PA on patients undergoing TJA (PROSPERO study protocol registration: CRD42023394031). Articles were included if full-text manuscripts in English were available, and the study analyzed the impact of PA and related interventions on TJA patients. There were 11 studies evaluating 1,276,663 patients included. Interventions were compared via presentation of key findings regarding rates of clinically relevant or high-risk PA reported upon screenings or testings, cephalosporin utilizations, allergic reactions, and postoperative infections (surgical site infection and periprosthetic joint infection).

Results

All 6 studies found that PA screening and testing markedly increase the use of first-line antibiotics. Testing showed low rates of true allergy (0.7 to 3%) and allergic reaction frequency for patients who have reported PA receiving cephalosporins was between 0% and 2%. Although there were mixed findings across studies, there was a trend toward second-line antibiotic prophylaxis being associated with a slightly higher rate of infection in PA patients.

Conclusions

Using PA screening and testing can promote antibiotic stewardship by safely increasing the use of first-line antibiotics in patients who have a reported PA.

### Is vancomycin-only prophylaxis for patients with penicillin allergy associated with increased risk of infection after arthroplasty? [^114UpMZT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis remains one of the most important strategies for prevention of postoperative infection. In patients with penicillin allergy, alternative medications such as vancomycin are often used despite reduced antimicrobial coverage and recent literature questioning the efficacy of vancomycin monotherapy.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are patients who receive vancomycin alone for penicillin allergy at greater odds of developing surgical site infection (SSI) as compared with patients who receive cefazolin for prophylaxis before total joint arthroplasty (TJA) without a patient-reported allergy? (2) What organism profile is associated with vancomycin monotherapy?

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 10,391 primary TJAs performed between 2005 and 2014 at two institutions with a minimum of 1-year followup. Patients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy were electronically queried from the anesthesia note. The odds of deep SSI and causative organisms were compared using multivariate analysis between β-lactam-allergic patients receiving vancomycin and nonallergic patients receiving cefazolin.

Results

After controlling for potential confounders, including comorbidities, we found that vancomycin alone did not affect the odds of deep SSI development (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–1.43; p = 0.907). Although the overall odds of deep SSI were not different for patients receiving vancomycin versus cefazolin, we found that vancomycin was associated with a reduced risk of infection with Gram-positive organisms (adjusted OR, 0.25 [CI, 0.10–0.62]; p = 0.003) and antibiotic-resistant organisms (adjusted OR, 0.10 [CI, 0.01–0.88]; p = 0.038). Vancomycin also demonstrated an increased risk of Gram-negative infection in bivariate analysis (OR, 2.42 [CI, 1.01–5.82]; p = 0.049) compared to cefazolin.

Conclusions

With the numbers available, vancomycin alone during elective primary TJA does not seem to result in a higher rate of subsequent deep SSI. However, patients who received vancomycin alone demonstrated reduced odds of Gram-positive organisms and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin monotherapy can be used without increasing the risk of deep SSI; however, it should only be used in patients who require vancomycin, eg, anaphylactic reactions to penicillin resulting from the potential for the emergence of organism resistance and nephrotoxicity. Future studies are needed that use registry and large database studies to refute or confirm the preliminary findings of this study and determine if vancomycin monotherapy influences the risk of periprosthetic joint infection.

GRADE Methodology

We planned to use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We planned to use methods and recommendations described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using GRADEpro GDT software. The overall "Risk of bias" judgement for each study was planned to be used as part of the GRADE assessment of study limitations. The first version of the Risk of Bias tool was planned to be used due to concerns regarding the difficulty of version 2, even for experienced users, which may result in delays in publication.

We justified all decisions to downgrade the evidence's quality using footnotes and added comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review if necessary.

Data Synthesis Incl. Meta-analyses

For binary (dichotomous) outcomes, we planned to use Risk Ratios (RR). All measures were planned to be presented with a 95% confidence interval. We planned to enter data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect.

We planned to use a random-effects model due to the high probability of heterogeneity in the RCTs and other evidence that might have been included in this review.

We planned to use forest plots to visualize the meta-analysis results and the GRADE methodology for presenting the certainty of the evidence as explained by the Cochrane Handbook. We planned to upload the RevMan files to GRADE GDT to create a summary of findings table for interventional studies.

We planned for all studies to be included in the primary analysis, and to assess the potential effects of studies at high risk or high risk/some concerns, we planned to carry out sensitivity analyses.

Assessment of Heterogeneity

We planned to inspect forest plots visually to consider the direction and magnitude of effects and the degree of overlap between confidence intervals. We planned to use the I² and Tau² statistics to measure heterogeneity among the studies in each analysis. We acknowledged that there is substantial uncertainty in the value of I² when only a small number of studies exist. We also considered the P -value from the Chi² test.

Subgroup Analysis

We planned to carry out subgroup analyses for the following factors for all outcomes but only for our primary time point of interest:

- Children

- Adolescents

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115wKYFd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) position statement — penicillin allergy label epidemiology and consequences — notes that penicillin allergy is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the population and up to 15% of hospitalized patients are labeled with a penicillin allergy, yet when evaluation is performed in those reporting a history, the overwhelming majority tolerate penicillins and the allergy label can be removed and the patient can be delabeled. A penicillin allergy label is associated with poor patient outcomes including increased hospital length of stay, increased perioperative infections, and overall increased mortality, and use of alternative antibiotics can be associated with higher costs, inferior efficacy and/or greater risk for untoward effects including antibiotic resistance, Clostridium difficile, and side effects. Penicillin allergy testing is associated with significantly less health care utilization over the next several years and greater use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and has a very favorable cost-benefit ratio for the incremental cost of testing versus future health care utilization.

Changes from the Protocol

We identified no studies meeting our inclusion criteria. After this finding was presented to the WHO Guideline Committee in March 2023, we were advised to summarize the most relevant systematic reviews on this topic focusing on broader populations, with no limitation to healthcare conditions, to potentially inform the guideline development. This change was based on the assumption that evidence was required to address this question and allergic reactions are immunologically mediated and, there is no data suggesting a different behavior (incidence or severity) in RHD patients. We used the following simple search strategy in PubMed to identify the most relevant systematic reviews on 1st December 2022:

### Antibiotic stewardship interventions improve choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty in patients with reported penicillin allergies [^112szDKe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate cefazolin, the preferred prophylaxis in a total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Regardless, patients with a reported penicillin allergy are less likely to receive first-line perioperative antibiotics as a result of inaccurate penicillin allergy documentation and misconceptions regarding cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins. The over-reporting of penicillin allergies and the safety of cephalosporins in patients with reported penicillin allergies have been well established throughout the evidence [13].

Questions/Purposes

The study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA? (2) What is the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy?

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of orthopaedic patients older than 18 years who underwent a primary elective TJA at a 261-bed community hospital. The study had two periods: the preintervention period ran from March 1, 2017 to August 30, 2017 and the postintervention period was from March 1, 2019 to August 30, 2019. A total of 396 patients with a history of a documented penicillin allergy underwent a THA or TKA during the study periods. After reviewing every fourth patient with a history of a documented penicillin allergy who met study inclusion criteria and excluding those patients who had a codocumented cephalosporin allergy, a total of 180 patients with a documented penicillin allergy were evaluated (90 patients in the preintervention group and 90 patients in the postintervention group). To answer our first study question, regarding whether antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA, we evaluated appropriate antibiotic usage pre- and postintervention. To answer our second study question, concerning the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy, we reviewed signs of allergic reactions in patients who received cefazolin for a primary TJA and had a documented penicillin allergy.

Results

Postintervention antibiotic use was more appropriate (91% [82 of 90] versus 54% [49 of 90], risk ratio 1.67 [95% confidence interval 1.37 to 2.04]; p < 0.01), particularly in patients with nonsevere allergy (preintervention: 47% [36 of 76] versus postintervention: 96% [76 of 79]; p < 0.01). No patients had signs of an allergic reaction related to cefazolin, including eight patients with severe penicillin allergy.

Conclusion

A multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention increased the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective primary TJA. Patients with nonsevere penicillin allergies, even those reporting hives or local swelling, tolerated cefazolin. Antibiotic stewardship interventions can be implemented across institutions to expand cephalosporin use in patients with a reported penicillin allergy within orthopaedic TJA patients.

Information for the Patient

Patients should be counselled that antibacterial drugs including dicloxacillin sodium capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When dicloxacillin sodium capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by dicloxacillin sodium capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Patients receiving penicillins should be given the following information and instructions by the physician:

Patients should be told that penicillin is an antibacterial agent which will work with the body's natural defenses to control certain types of infections. They should be told that the drug should not be taken if they have had an allergic reaction to any form of penicillin previously, and to inform the physician of any allergies or previous allergic reactions to any drugs they may have had (see WARNINGS).
Patients who have previously experienced an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin should be instructed to wear a medical identification tag or bracelet.
Because most antibacterial drugs taken by mouth are best absorbed on an empty stomach, patients should be directed, unless circumstances warrant otherwise, to take penicillin one hour before meals or two hours after eating (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics).
Patients should be told to take the entire course of therapy prescribed, even if fever and other symptoms have stopped (see PRECAUTIONS - General).
If any of the following reactions occur, stop taking your prescription and notify the physician: shortness of breath, wheezing, skin rash, mouth irritation, black tongue, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, swollen joints or any unusual bleeding or bruising (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Do not take any additional medications without physician approval, including nonprescription drugs such as antacids, laxatives or vitamins.

### Buffered penicillin g potassium [^113atnkg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma (see WARNINGS). Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is lifethreatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy.

Buffered Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP by the intravenous route in high doses (above 10 million units) should be administered slowly because of the potential adverse effects of electrolyte imbalance from the potassium content of the penicillin. Buffered Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP contains approximately 6.8 milligrams of sodium (0.3 mEq) and 65.6 milligrams of potassium (1.68 mEq) per million units of penicillin G.

The use of antibiotics may promote overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Indwelling intravenous catheters encourage superinfections. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken.

When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Prescribing Penicillin G Potassium in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Laboratory Tests

Periodic assessment of organ system function, including frequent evaluation of electrolyte balance, hepatic, renal and hematopoietic systems, and cardiac and vascular status should be performed during prolonged therapy with high doses of intravenous penicillin G (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). If any impairment of function is suspected or known to exist, a reduction in the total dosage should be considered (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Understanding penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity, and antibiotic selection in the preoperative setting [^115uPo2Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergies are reported by 8% to 15% of the US population, but up to 95% of these allergies do not correspond to a true allergy when tested. Recent studies have demonstrated that having a penicillin allergy label (PAL) results in a 50% increased odds of surgical site infection among patients reporting a penicillin allergy entirely attributable to the use of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic (primarily clindamycin or vancomycin). This study provides a review of the prevalence of PAL, the cross-reactivity with cefazolin, immunogenic components of cefazolin and penicillin, and current guidelines for preoperative antibiotic selection in patients with PALs. On understanding these principles, a new set of guidelines and a risk stratification tool are proposed for assessing allergies and determining appropriate antibiotic choice, dosage, and timing in the orthopaedic preoperative setting.

### A simple algorithmic approach allows the safe use of cephalosporin in "Penicillin-allergic" patients without the need for allergy testing [^115tN7yA]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who report a penicillin allergy are often given second-line antibiotic prophylaxis during total joint arthroplasty (TJA), with only a minority of patients undergoing additional consultations and allergy testing. In an effort to increase the use of cephalosporin prophylaxis in TJA, the present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a simple, protocol-driven penicillin allergy screening program without the need for additional work-up.

Methods

Following implementation of a questionnaire-based screening protocol in May 2019, all patients scheduled for primary TJA were risk-stratified into low or high-risk categories. The low-risk cohort received cefazolin, and the high-risk cohort received non-cefazolin antibiotics. Patients were monitored prospectively, and data on antibiotic usage and adverse outcomes were documented. The protocol group (n = 2,078) was propensity score matched 1:1 with a control group that included patients who underwent TJA in the same institution prior to implementation of the protocol. The primary end point was the efficacy of the protocol in reducing unnecessary use of non-cephalosporin antibiotics for prophylaxis. Secondary outcomes included the rate of surgical site infections and allergic reactions to the administered antibiotic.

Results

A total of 357 patients (17.2%) reported a penicillin allergy in the protocol group compared with 310 patients (14.9%) with a recorded allergy in the control group (p = 0.052). The number of patients who received non-cephalosporin antibiotics was significantly lower in the protocol group (5.7% compared with 15.2% in the control group; p < 0.001), whereas there was no difference in the rate of total allergic reactions (0.8% compared with 0.7%, respectively; p = 0.857). Of the 239 low-risk patients (66.9%) in the protocol group, only 3 (1.3%) experienced a mild cutaneous reaction following cefazolin administration. There were no differences in the rates of superficial wound, deep periprosthetic, or Clostridioides difficile infections between the protocol and control groups.

Conclusions

A simple screening protocol allowed two-thirds of patients with a self-reported allergy to receive cefazolin without the need for additional consultations or testing. We believe this protocol can be safely implemented to increase the rate of cefazolin usage without a corresponding increase in the number of allergic reactions.

Carbapenems — patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). The overall reported incidence of carbapenem allergy is 0.3%-3.7%. In a systematic review including 838 patients with proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, carbapenem reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients (95% CI: 3.1%-5.9%), and among those with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295) only 1 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.006%-1.9%) reacted. Another meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (1127 patients) found cross-reactivity to any carbapenem as 0.87% (95% CI: 0.32%-2.32%), and in a prospective study of 211 patients with skin test–confirmed penicillin allergy all tolerated carbapenems. Patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, as long as it is not a severe delayed cutaneous or organ-involved reaction, can receive carbapenems without prior testing, though in certain situations such as multiple drug allergy or significant patient anxiety a graded drug challenge might be preferred.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Documented penicillin allergies should not preclude use of preoperative cefazolin in hip and knee arthroplasty [^11177vp8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perioperative cefazolin administration for total joint arthroplasty is a first-line antibiotic recommended by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines for the prevention of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). We aim to analyze the clinical viability of giving patients with a documented penicillin allergy (PA) a perioperative full-strength cefazolin "test dose" under anesthesia.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of 2,451 total joint arthroplasties from a high-volume arthroplasty orthopaedic surgeon over a 5-year period from January 2013 through December 2017. This surgeon routinely gave patients with a documented PA a full-strength cefazolin test dose while under anesthesia instead of administrating a second-line antibiotic. The primary outcomes examined were allergic reaction and postoperative infection.

Results

Cefazolin was given to 87.1% of all patients (1,990) and 46.0% of patients with a PA (143). The total rate of allergic reactions among all patients was 0.5% (11). Only one patient with a documented PA who received cefazolin had an allergic reaction. The reaction was not severe and did not require any additional treatment. In patients who had no reported allergies and received cefazolin, 0.3% (6) had an allergic reaction. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of allergic reaction when comparing patients with and without a PA (P = 0.95). Patients receiving cefazolin had an overall PJI rate of 2.9% (57) versus those patients receiving antibiotics other than cefazolin who sustained a 5.5% PJI rate (16), which was statistically significant (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

This study found that utilization of a full-strength test dose of cefazolin in patients with a documented PA is a feasible, safe, and effective way of increasing the rate of cefazolin administration and thus mitigating the risk of PJIs.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and are a threat to appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is enormous: SSIs are the most common and costly health care–associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. The aims of administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multi–drug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures because of its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by reduction in use of first-line antibiotics (most often cefazolin). When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are demonstrably higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multi–drug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.,

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, there is good evidence that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled because either a patient was mislabeled at the time of the inciting event or because, in cases of true allergy, most cases will be outgrown within 10 years. For this reason, such patients are referred to as having penicillin allergy labels, termed to connote the common mislabel. Moreover, a plethora of research now suggests that even in true IgE-mediated penicillin allergies, there is limited cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, especially cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains. In congruence with this understanding, the Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology released updated drug allergy practice parameters in 2022, suggesting that patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin can be given cephalosporins with structurally dissimilar R1 side chains, such as cefazolin. However, other national infectious disease, anesthesiology, and surgical guidelines have not been updated to this effect, and this has not yet been implemented in many surgical centers.

### Perioperative cefazolin for total joint arthroplasty patients who have a penicillin allergy: is It safe? [^115QEy9w]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cefazolin is the standard of care for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in the United States. The potential allergic cross-reactivity between cefazolin and penicillin causes uncertainty regarding optimal antibiotic choice in patients who have a reported penicillin allergy (rPCNA). The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of perioperative cefazolin in PCNA patients undergoing primary TJA.

Methods

We identified all patients (n = 49,842) undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (n = 25,659) or total knee arthroplasty (n = 24,183) from 2016 to 2022 who received perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients who had an rPCNA (n = 5,508) who received cefazolin (n = 4,938, 89.7%) were compared to rPCNA patients who did not (n = 570, 10.3%), and to patients who did not have an rPCNA (n = 43,359). The primary outcome was the rate of allergic reactions within 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the rates of superficial infections, deep infections, and Clostridioides difficile infections within 90 days.

Results

The rate of allergic reactions was 0.1% (n = 5) in rPCNA patients who received cefazolin, compared to 0.2% (n = 1) in rPCNA patients who did not (P = 0.48) and 0.02% (n = 11) in patients who have no rPCNA (P = 0.02). Allergic reactions were mild in all 5 rPCNA patients who received cefazolin and were characterized by cutaneous symptoms (n = 4) or dyspnea in the absence of respiratory distress (n = 1) that resolved promptly with antibiotic discontinuation and administration of antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. We observed no differences in the rates of superficial infections (0.1 versus 0.2%, P = 0.58), deep infections (0.3 versus 0.4%, P = 0.68), or C difficile infections (0.04% versus 0%, P = 0.99) within 90 days in rPCNA patients who received cefazolin versus alternative perioperative antibiotics.

Conclusions

In this series of more than 5,500 patients who had an rPCNA undergoing primary TJA, perioperative prophylaxis with cefazolin resulted in a 0.1% incidence of allergic reactions that were clinically indolent. Cefazolin can be safely administered to most patients, independent of rPCNA severity.

### Ethics of antibiotic allergy [^113iXsuN]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many patients are labelled as being allergic to antibiotics, which leads to under-recognised ethical challenges. Consider this common clinical dilemma: a patient presents with a bacterial infection that warrants antibiotic treatment. The 'first-line' treatment for the infection is a penicillin antibiotic. This treatment is expected to be the best option for the patient (in terms of the balance of benefits, ie, chance of cure vs harms including antibiotic-related adverse effects) and public health (in terms of patient benefits vs public health harms, such as the development of resistant bacteria) compared to 'second-line' drugs. However, the patient's medical record includes a label of penicillin allergy.

To treat this patient, the doctor has two main options:

Prescribe first-line (penicillin) treatment, despite the risk of allergic reaction, in order to offer the best chance of cure.
Prescribe second-line (non-penicillin) treatment, despite the lower chance of cure, in order to avoid an allergic reaction.

If the treatment is not urgent, doctors may also:

Perform allergy testing to determine whether the patient is truly allergic.

For now, assume that allergy testing is infeasible or the treatment is urgent. Deciding between first-line and second-line antibiotics can be a difficult ethical dilemma, because each option is associated with different benefits (eg, likelihood of cure) and risks (of allergic reaction and non-allergic harms), of varying magnitudes.

Physicians and patients almost always preference avoiding first-line therapy in the face of such dilemmas, due to a view that individuals with a label of antibiotic allergy face significant risks if exposed to the antibiotic (or class of antibiotics) in question. Physicians may also hold the view that causing harm (via a reaction to a prescribed drug) is less ethically acceptable than allowing harm to happen (by giving the patient treatment less likely to cure their infection).

Beta-lactam allergy assessment to improve first-line antibiotic use — In patients reporting allergy of β-lactam agents, we suggest that ASPs promote allergy assessments and penicillin (PCN) skin testing when appropriate (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Allergy assessments and PCN skin testing can enhance use of first-line agents, but it is largely unstudied as a primary ASP intervention, and in facilities with appropriate resources for skin testing, the ASPs should actively work to develop testing and treatment strategies with allergists.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

Proactive penicillin allergy evaluation implementation — Penicillin allergy evaluations should be offered proactively to patients during routine visits, in advance of antibiotic need, including to children and pregnant women. Specific programs have successfully targeted patients likely to require antibiotics, such as inpatients, ICU patients, oncology patients, pre-operative patients, and patients planning for organ transplantation. Importantly, penicillin allergy evaluation by any means has been shown to be a cost-saving intervention, while inappropriate re-labeling in the electronic health record remains a challenge and efforts are underway to combat it, making accurate communication of results to delabeled patients and their care team paramount.

Delabeling penicillin allergy is an important component of antibiotic stewardship and is endorsed by many professional organizations and public health bodies, and a penicillin allergy evaluation is not necessary for patients with a family history of penicillin allergy only or a side effect such as headache or nausea; these patients may simply be delabeled by history alone.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113P9GHM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

On the subject of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the practice parameter suggests again stratifying patients on the basis of anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite the simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent to which this approach is incorporated into allergy practice remains unclear. Therefore, we surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess current practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real case examples.

### Is patient-reported penicillin allergy independently associated with increased risk of prosthetic joint infection after total joint arthroplasty of the hip, knee, and shoulder? [^117CxRDi]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with a patient-reported penicillin allergy may be at greater risk for postoperative prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total joint arthroplasty of the hip, knee, or shoulder. The increased risk of PJI in these patients has been attributed to these patients receiving a less-effective perioperative antibiotic. However, prior reports did not fully address the clinical characteristics of these unique patients, who may inherently be at greater risk of having a PJI, which may confound prior findings.

Questions/Purposes

After controlling for risk factors for PJI such as BMI, anxiety, depression, and other comorbidities, we asked: Are patients with a patient-reported penicillin allergy more likely to have a PJI after THA, TKA, or total shoulder arthroplasty than patients without such a reported allergy?

Methods

We queried patient records from 2010 to 2017 from a nationwide administrative claims database of 122 million patients to adequately power an investigation comparing the 1-year incidence of PJI after TKA, total shoulder arthroplasty, and THA in patients with patient-reported penicillin allergy versus patients without a patient-reported penicillin allergy. Operative treatments for deep joint infection, identified by Current Procedural Terminology and ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were used as a surrogate for PJI. Clinical characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, length of stay, and Charlson comorbidity index and specific comorbidities including alcohol abuse, anemia, anxiety, cardiac disease, diabetes, immunocompromised status, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, tobacco use, and peripheral vascular disease were queried for each study group. The odds of PJI within 1 year of THA, TKA, or total shoulder arthroplasty were compared using multiple logistic regression after adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

After adjusting for potential confounding factors such as BMI, anxiety, depression and other comorbidities, we found that patient-reported penicillin allergy was independently associated with an increased odds of PJI after TKA (odds ratio 1.3 [95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4]; p < 0.01) and total shoulder arthroplasty (OR 3.9 [95% CI 2.7 to 5.4]; p < 0.01). However, patient-reported penicillin allergy was not independently associated with an increased odds of PJI after THA (OR 1.1 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.3]; p = 0.36) after controlling for the same risk factors.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that patients with patient-reported penicillin allergy were at an increased risk for PJI after TKA and total shoulder arthroplasty, which we suspect-but cannot prove-is likely a function of those patients receiving a second-line antibiotic for presurgical prophylaxis. Since prior research has found that many patients listed in medical records as having a penicillin allergy are in fact not allergic to penicillin, we suggest that surgeons consider preoperative allergy testing, such as using an intraoperative test dose, to aid in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic choice before knee or shoulder arthroplasty and to amend patient medical records based on testing results. Future studies should determine whether this additional diagnostic maneuver is cost-effective.

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old man with extensive travel history to developing countries was hospitalised for intermittent sharp chest pains, worst when supine and with inspiration. Two weeks prior to presentation, he had suffered a flu-like illness with a sore throat, which was resolving. Physical examination was notable for mild fever and tachycardia with cervical lymphadenopathy and painful bilateral knee and wrist effusions. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a soft early-peaking systolic murmur over the aortic area with a decrescendo early diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge. There was mild leucocytosis, elevation of serum troponin and acute-phase reactants with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Echocardiographic windows were extremely limited but suggested the presence of pericardial effusion and aortic regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed (figure 1). Viral, microbiological and autoimmune testing was remarkable only for significant elevation of antistreptolysin-O titres (1450IU rising to 1940IU, normal < 200IU). Pericardiocentesis revealed an exudative effusion, which was negative by cytology and microbiological analysis, including for tuberculosis and fungi.

### Economic burden of patient-reported penicillin allergy on total hip and total knee arthroplasty [^111bN5F9]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Self-reported penicillin allergies in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty often results in the use of second-line prophylactic antibiotics. A higher risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is associated with suboptimal antibiotics vs first generation cephalosporins, which have historically been grouped with other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin for potential allergic reactions. This study evaluates the economic burden of self-reported penicillin allergies in total joint arthroplasty (TJA).

Methods

Data from studies reporting true incidence of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies, infection-free survivorship of TJA, and cost of PJI attributed to use of second-line antibiotics were obtained. Projected cost of preoperative penicillin allergy testing and potentially avoidable PJI associated with second-line antibiotic usage were calculated. This was compared with projected cost of PJI in the current state to estimate cost savings.

Results

Implementation of preoperative penicillin allergy testing leads to a potential savings of nearly $37 million to payors in the first year based on 1-year survivorship. This savings increases to $411.6 million over a 10-year span and $1.18 billion over a 20-year span.

Conclusion

Preoperative penicillin allergy testing or risk stratification via thorough history should be implemented as standard of care for patients with self-reported penicillin allergies before TJA and would result in decreased cost of PJI.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: a review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

β-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

Observations

Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (< 5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (> 10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple β-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources.

Conclusions and Relevance

Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship.

### Surgical site infection after arthroplasty: comparative effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics: Do surgical care improvement project guidelines need to be updated? [^115sXZna]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic antibiotics decrease surgical site infection (SSI) rates, and their timing, choice, and discontinuation are measured and reported as part of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP). The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effectiveness of the SCIP-approved antibiotics for SSI prevention.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study utilized national Veterans Affairs (VA) data on patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty from 2005 to 2009. Data on prophylactic antibiotics were merged with VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program data to identify patient and procedure-related risk factors for SSI. Patients were stratified by documented penicillin allergy. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare SSI rates among patients receiving SCIP-approved prophylactic antibiotics.

Results

A total of 18,830 elective primary arthroplasties (12,823 knee and 6007 hip) were included. Most patients received prophylactic cefazolin as the sole agent (81.9%), followed by vancomycin as the sole agent (8.0%), vancomycin plus cefazolin (5.6%), and clindamycin (4.5%). Documented penicillin allergy accounted for 54.1% of cases involving vancomycin administration compared with 94.6% of cases involving clindamycin. The overall thirty-day SSI rate was 1.4%, and the unadjusted rate was 2.3% with vancomycin only, 1.5% with vancomycin plus cefazolin, 1.3% with cefazolin only, and 1.1% with clindamycin. Unadjusted analysis of penicillin-allergic patients revealed an SSI rate of 2.0% with vancomycin only compared with 1.0% with clindamycin (p = 0.18). For patients without penicillin allergy, the SSI rate was 2.6% with vancomycin only compared with 1.6% with vancomycin plus cefazolin (p = 0.17) and 1.3% with cefazolin only (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Current SCIP guidelines address antibiotic timing but not antibiotic dosage. (The generally accepted recommendation for vancomycin is 15 mg/kg.) Although vancomycin is a narrower-spectrum antibiotic than either cefazolin or clindamycin, our finding of higher SSI rates following prophylaxis with vancomycin only may suggest a failure to use an appropriate dosage rather than an inequality of antibiotic effectiveness.

23, 606–608). For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low. For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used. For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance is required. Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment. Recommendations Persons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous reaction and other severe non-IgE-mediated reactions are not candidates for penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any other ß-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely among these patients, and they should be referred to an allergy center for further evaluation. Persons with high-risk symptom histories should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.

Managing Persons Being Tested Patients who have a positive skin test should not receive ß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be referred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further evaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented in the medical record. Patients who test negative should be informed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is equivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If treatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be administered safely. Documentation of testing results should be provided to the patient.
