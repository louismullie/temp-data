## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most specific ICD-10-CM code that explicitly names papillary necrosis. Then, I should verify whether there is a more general code that still captures medullary necrosis if the exact papillary term is not found. Next, I will check authoritative coding sources and FDA labeling that mention papillary necrosis to confirm the terminology maps correctly. Finally, I will consider alternatives and ensure the code I select is the most precise and clinically appropriate option available in ICD-10-CM.

> Let me first confirm the most specific candidate. The ICD-10-CM code N17.2 is explicitly labeled "Acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis", which in clinical usage corresponds to papillary necrosis of the renal medulla; this is the closest explicit ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis that I can identify in the provided materials [^f23a8929].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology alignment. Multiple clinical sources describe renal papillary necrosis as a medullary process with ischemic necrosis of the papillae, reinforcing that "medullary necrosis" in ICD-10-CM is the appropriate morphologic descriptor for papillary necrosis in this context [^3e4512dc] [^550b9db7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether any document here lists an even more specific code that includes "papillary" in the descriptor. I do not see an ICD-10-CM code in the provided references that literally contains the word "papillary" for this entity, which supports using N17.2 as the most specific available code for papillary necrosis in ICD-10-CM within the supplied sources [^notfound].

> I need to ensure clinical plausibility. Renal papillary necrosis is a recognized cause of acute kidney injury, and ICD-10-CM places medullary necrosis under the N17 acute kidney failure block, which fits the typical clinical scenario of papillary necrosis leading to AKI, even if the etiology is not specified in the code itself [^f23a8929].

> But wait, what if the documentation does not support an acute kidney failure diagnosis? Let me consider alternatives. If there is no documented AKI, a less specific code such as N28.89 ("Other specified disorders of kidney and ureter") could be used to capture papillary necrosis without implying AKI, though this sacrifices specificity and should be reserved for cases where AKI is not present or not documented [^notfound].

> Final answer: The most specific ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis in the provided materials is N17.2, "Acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis", which corresponds to papillary necrosis of the renal medulla [^f23a8929].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis is **N17.2** (acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis) [^f23a8929]. If papillary necrosis is present without acute kidney failure, use **N28.89** (other specified disorders of kidney and ureter) [^notfound]. Always document the underlying cause (e.g. diabetes, sickle cell disease, NSAID use) to support accurate coding and clinical context [^notfound].

## ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis

The primary ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis is **N17.2**, defined as acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis [^f23a8929]. This code specifically denotes necrosis of the renal medulla, which includes the renal papillae.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes

In cases where renal papillary necrosis occurs without acute kidney failure, the appropriate code is **N28.89** (other specified disorders of kidney and ureter) [^notfound]. This code should be used when papillary necrosis is documented but there is no evidence of acute kidney failure.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of renal papillary necrosis requires thorough clinical documentation, including:

- **Confirmation of diagnosis**: Document the presence of papillary necrosis, preferably with imaging or histopathological evidence [^3e4512dc].
- **Underlying cause**: Identify and document the underlying cause (e.g. diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, NSAID use, analgesic abuse, pyelonephritis) [^3e4512dc].
- **Presence of acute kidney failure**: Clearly document whether acute kidney failure is present, as this determines the use of N17.2 versus N28.89 [^f23a8929].

---

## Common underlying conditions associated with renal papillary necrosis

Renal papillary necrosis is associated with several underlying conditions, including:

| **Condition** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Diabetes mellitus | E10-E14 |
| Sickle cell disease | D57 |
| NSAID use | Z79.1 |
| Analgesic abuse | F55.8 |
| Pyelonephritis | N10 |

---

## Clinical implications of renal papillary necrosis

Renal papillary necrosis can lead to significant clinical complications, including:

- **Acute kidney failure**: Necrosis of the renal papillae can impair kidney function, leading to acute kidney failure [^f23a8929].
- **Hematuria**: Commonly presents with gross or microscopic hematuria [^f678d2e5].
- **Obstruction**: Sloughed papillae can cause ureteral obstruction, leading to hydronephrosis and further renal impairment [^3e4512dc].
- **Infection**: Increased risk of urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis [^ecc9ce48].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of renal papillary necrosis typically involves:

- **Imaging**: Intravenous urography (IVU), computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify characteristic findings such as contrast-filled clefts, nonenhanced lesions, and detached papillae [^3e4512dc].
- **Ultrasound**: May show multiple cystic spaces in the medullary region and nonshadowing soft tissue masses within the ureter [^550b9db7].
- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis may reveal hematuria, and renal function tests may indicate acute kidney failure [^f678d2e5].

---

## Treatment considerations

Management of renal papillary necrosis involves:

- **Addressing underlying cause**: Discontinuation of offending agents (e.g. NSAIDs), treatment of infections, and management of systemic conditions such as diabetes or sickle cell disease [^0a6d8e28].
- **Supportive care**: Hydration, pain management, and monitoring of renal function [^f678d2e5].
- **Surgical intervention**: In severe cases, surgical removal of obstructing papillae or nephrectomy may be required [^ecc9ce48].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for renal papillary necrosis is **N17.2** (acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis) [^f23a8929]. If papillary necrosis is present without acute kidney failure, use **N28.89** (other specified disorders of kidney and ureter) [^notfound]. Accurate coding requires detailed clinical documentation of the diagnosis, underlying cause, and presence or absence of acute kidney failure.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Reliability of diagnostic coding in intensive care patients [^3fa58e0c]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis coding

Coding is performed using the ICD-10 during the ICU stay and immediately at the time of ICU discharge and medical record writing. The treating physician allocates only one set of codes per patient. Coding concerned only data from the ICU stay since stays on other wards are assessed by the ward physicians. It includes a principal diagnosis, which plays a central role in the group allocation in the funding database. The choice of the principal diagnosis follows SRLF/SFAR guidelines. The ICD-10 includes around 52,000 codes. Each code consists of a letter followed by a number with at least two digits. The ICD-10 arborescence allows us to increase the details of the code by adding a digit to 'father' codes. For instance, diseases of the genital and urinary system begin with the letter 'N', the first three digits of the acute renal failure code are N17, and the fourth digit determines the mechanism of acute renal failure (tubular necrosis: N170, cortical necrosis: N171, and so on). Of the 662 codes proposed by the SRLF/SFAR guidelines, 49 (7%), 559 (84%), and 54 (8%) consist of three, four, or more than four digits, respectively. Agreement testing was performed after truncating to four those codes that consist of more than four digits. We did not assess the reliability of the therapeutic codes.

One hundred medical records were selected randomly from 29,393 cases collected in the database between 1998 and 2004 using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). The selection was balanced between hospitals. The original diagnostic codes selected by the physician treating the patient for DRG allocation were obtained from the DMI physician of each hospital. This physician was required to code in accordance with SRLF/SFAR guidelines but did not have to follow specific regular training. Each record was sent to two senior investigators from the Outcomerea database; these physicians worked in two ICUs (which were independent from the ICU caring for the patient) and were blinded to the original coding. Both physicians had received specific training in accordance with SRLF/SFAR guidelines during a 3-hour session at implementation of the database and then every 2 years or on recruitment of a new coder in each center. The coding of their first 10 records was audited.

Sickle cell disease — kidney complications include hyposthenuria beginning in infancy with prolonged enuresis risk, where fluid restriction may promote intravascular sickling and painful events; management includes counseling about the SCD-related concentrating defect, timed overnight waking to void, and waterproof mattress covers; renal papillary necrosis presents with painless gross hematuria and evaluation includes urinalysis, urine culture, abdominal ultrasonography, and screening coagulation tests with treatment of bed rest and hydration; proteinuria may progress to renal insufficiency, and if the protein-to-creatinine ratio is repeatedly elevated, screening of a first morning voided urine and referral to nephrology is advised.

### Low dose, oral epsilon aminocaproic acid for renal papillary necrosis and massive hemorrhage in hemoglobin SC disease [^ecc9ce48]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Renal papillary necrosis in sickling hemoglobinopathies can lead to significant complications, including hemorrhage, obstruction, and infection. Despite its frequency, there are limited therapies for protracted hemorrhage. In the past, massive hemorrhage was managed with nephrectomy. Here, we report a patient with hemoglobin SC disease and prolonged, life-threatening hemorrhage from papillary necrosis successfully treated with oral, low-dose epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). Although further study is warranted, this case illustrates the need to consider EACA in the conservative management of renal papillary necrosis and significant hemorrhage in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies.

### Renal papillary necrosis: review and comparison of findings at multi-detector row CT and intravenous urography [^3e4512dc]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Renal papillary necrosis is not a pathologic entity but rather a descriptive term for a condition — necrosis of the renal papillae — that has various possible causes. The renal medulla and papillae are vulnerable to ischemic necrosis because of the peculiar arrangement of their blood supply and the hypertonic environment. The etiology of renal papillary necrosis includes diabetes, analgesic abuse or overuse, sickle cell disease, pyelonephritis, renal vein thrombosis, tuberculosis, and obstructive uropathy. Renal papillary necrosis has been diagnosed with the use of intravenous urography and ultrasonography, but contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) may better depict a full range of typical features, including contrast material-filled clefts in the renal medulla, nonenhanced lesions surrounded by rings of excreted contrast material, and hyperattenuated medullary calcifications. In the presence of papillary sloughing, CT may depict hydronephrosis and filling defects in the renal pelvis or ureter, which also may contain calcifications. During healing, the epithelialized papillary tip appears blunted. Shrinkage of the kidney, a common sequela, also may be detected at CT. Multi-detector row CT depicts these and other features more clearly and directly than single-detector row CT, given the advantages of thinner sections and multiplanar reformation, and it may help identify the condition at an earlier stage, when effective treatment can reverse the ischemic process. Familiarity with the CT features of the condition therefore is useful for its successful diagnosis and management.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^0a6d8e28]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

### The ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition has not improved identification of rapidly progressing stage 3 and stage 4 chronic kidney disease patients: a diagnostic test study [^3e52c980]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system is widely utilized for administrative, clinical, and epidemiological purposes. ICD codes serve a vital role in informing the medical community as key decisions are made regarding policy and reimbursement decisions. On October 1, 2015, the 10th revision of the ICD coding system was implemented under mandate of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Previous research has examined the accuracy of ICD-10 coding with regard to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), but limited longitudinal data precluded examining ICD-10 coding data accuracy in the context of disease progression. This study utilizes ICD-10 data originating in a large claims database from 2016 to 2021 to assess ICD-10 coding accuracy among CKD patients.

The previous ICD-9 system was revised to ICD-10 with the aim of increasing specificity of the codes. This increased specificity allows for rapid incorporation of emerging diseases and higher detail allowing for more precise diagnostic codes. Consequentially, ICD-10 boasts 69,823 codes compared to only 14,025 for ICD-9. However, CKD diagnostic codes have not benefitted from the improvements from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Indeed, the primary diagnostic codes indicating CKD staging simply change the prefix from 585 to N18, yet continue to identify only the primary stages with no distinction between stage 3a and stage 3b. Codes indicating an underlying cause of CKD have increased allowing for more detailed diagnosis and better tracking of the disease's etiology, though whether this translates to improved diagnostic has not been established.

### Renal cell carcinoma: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^d23be596]. Annals of Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for renal cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to classification, ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend to focus on established subtypes with well-defined treatment algorithms, such as clear cell RCC and papillary RCC, rather than routinely using the recent WHO classification.

### New primary renal diagnosis codes for the ERA-EDTA [^888e2d48]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Further details about the codes and their attributes are given in 'Notes for Users' which are published with the codes. An unusual feature of the PRDs is the inclusion of the term 'histologically proven' and 'no histology' even for some PRDs, which should not reasonably be used without histological evidence. These terms are used to satisfy the requirement to provide detail, as a measure of the certainty of the diagnosis and to say everything in a single line of text. We provide PRDs that contain the words 'no histology' for diagnoses that clearly require histological proof (eg 'IgA nephropathy - no histology'). It is clear from Registry records that PRDs which describe the histological appearance of a kidney biopsy are frequently used even when histological evidence is not available and an alternative less granular PRD would be more suitable. We do not condone this practice. We hope that nephrologists who wish to record such a diagnosis will use the PRD which contains the words 'no histology' so that if required they can be analysed separately from the similar PRD which contains the words 'histologically proven'. We hope that it will henceforth be possible to distinguish an honest guess from a firm diagnosis using gold standard criteria, and we recognize that as new and accurate non-histological diagnostic techniques (e.g. genetic tests) are developed, additional codes will be needed to include and specifically exclude these options. For Registry purposes, only one PRD code can be assigned to a patient.

Two examples of common clinical situations with the old PRD terms which might have been used and the new PRDs which are now available will illustrate the utility of the new list.

Example 1

An adult patient presents with a vasculitic rash and a rising serum creatinine. Haematuria and proteinuria are present. Tests for Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) are strongly positive. Kidney biopsy is technically impossible because of obesity. A clinical diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis is made, and the patient responds well to immunosuppressive treatment.

With the old classification, the patient might have been allocated one of the following codes:

With the new codes, we will probably use either:

### New primary renal diagnosis codes for the ERA-EDTA [^3faf70ad]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

The European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry has produced a new set of primary renal diagnosis (PRD) codes that are intended for use by affiliated registries. It is designed specifically for use in renal centres and registries but is aligned with international coding standards supported by the WHO (International Classification of Diseases) and the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization (SNOMED Clinical Terms). It is available as supplementary material to this paper and free on the internet for non-commercial, clinical, quality improvement and research use, and by agreement with the ERA-EDTA Registry for use by commercial organizations. Conversion between the old and the new PRD codes is possible. The new codes are very flexible and will be actively managed to keep them up-to-date and to ensure that renal medicine can remain at the forefront of the electronic revolution in medicine, epidemiology research and the use of decision support systems to improve the care of patients.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Sorting the alphabet soup of renal pathology: a review [^f9a37911]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Diseases of the kidney often have their names shortened, creating an arcane set of acronyms which can be confusing to both radiologists and clinicians. This review of renal pathology aims to explain some of the most commonly used acronyms within the field. For each entity, a summary of the clinical features, pathophysiology, and radiological findings is included to aid in the understanding and differentiation of these entities. Discussed topics include acute cortical necrosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, angiomyolipoma, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, acute tubular necrosis, localized cystic renal disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, multilocular cystic nephroma, multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, medullary sponge kidney, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, renal papillary necrosis, transitional cell carcinoma, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

### Nabumetone (nabumetone 500 mg) [^c8cd7a1a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Outcomes following diagnosis of acute renal failure in U.S. veterans: focus on acute tubular necrosis [^003df018]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

When patients develop acute kidney injury, a small fraction of them will develop end-stage renal disease later. The severity of renal impairment in the remaining patients is uncertain because studies have not carefully examined renal function over time or the precise timing of entry into a late stage of chronic kidney disease. To determine these factors, we used a United States Department of Veterans Affairs database to ascertain long-term renal function in 113,272 patients. Of these, 44,377 had established chronic kidney disease and were analyzed separately. A cohort of 63,491 patients was hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or pneumonia and designated as controls. The remaining 5,404 patients had diagnostic codes indicating acute renal failure or acute tubular necrosis. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rates, and dates of death over a 75-month period were followed. Renal function deteriorated over time in all groups, but with significantly greater severity in those who had acute renal failure and acute tubular necrosis compared to controls. Patients with acute kidney injury, especially those with acute tubular necrosis, were more likely than controls to enter stage 4 chronic kidney disease, but this entry time was similar to that of patients who initially had chronic kidney disease. The risk of death was elevated in those with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease compared to controls after accounting for covariates. We found that patients who had an episode of acute tubular necrosis were at high risk for the development of stage 4 disease and had a reduced survival time when compared to control patients.

### Coding practice in national and regional kidney biopsy registries [^4f25bdb0]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Self-reported problems and suggestions for improvement

In an open question format, we asked the contact persons from the registries about the advantages and disadvantages of their system. Eleven of 15 registries answered this question with a comment on problems of their registry or with a suggestion for improvement.

The lack of maintenance and updates of the coding system was the most common comment, mentioned in some form by respondents from 6 registries. Two registries mentioned a problem with interoperability with international systems. Other issues were mentioned once: ambiguity related to lack of coding rules, insufficient coding possibilities (not all diagnoses included, no morphology diagnoses, too many irrelevant codes), difficulties retrieving data from the system, problems to code more than one diagnosis per biopsy, necessity of a system for transplant biopsies and finally the need to record histopathological patterns and findings.

Suggestions for improvement included the need for a simple system (mentioned twice), the need for a consistent system (mentioned once) and finally the need to code prospectively (mentioned once): this means coding when making the diagnosis and not when data are recorded in the registry (i.e. retrospectively).

### Tumor necrosis-informed prognostic nomogram for clear cell renal cell carcinoma model development and clinical validation [^81b9175e]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal cell carcinoma(RCC) constitutes 2–3% of all adult cancers and represents the third most frequent urinary malignancy, demonstrating steadily rising incidence rates throughout the past thirty years. RCC contributes to an estimated 403,000 new cases and 175,000 deaths globally each year. Enhanced public health consciousness and sophisticated diagnostic technologies have progressively increased the proportion of incidentally detected renal cell carcinomas. In RCC, ccRCC is the most common pathological type and has the worst prognosis compared with papillary renal cell tumor and chromophobe tumor. It has received increasing attention in clinical practice. Although most cases of RCC are diagnosed at an early stage, approximately 20% of patients who undergo curative nephrectomy develop metastases during follow-up, and surgery is the primary treatment for localized RCC. Currently, although targeted therapy and immunotherapy extend the survival time of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, their efficacy is limited by their low objective response rate and drug resistance. Consequently, evolving systemic therapies necessitate enhanced prognostic risk assessment for RCC patient stratification, clinical decisions, and survival optimization. Current prognostic cornerstones remain TNM staging and Fuhrman nuclear grading. In addition, prognostic models such as the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system and the International Association of Uropathologists (ISUP) are also important factors influencing prognosis. While TNM staging and Fuhrman nuclear grading currently serve as core tools for prognostic assessment in ccRCC, they still have limitations in clinical practice. On one hand, these indices primarily rely on morphological features such as tumor size and invasion extent, making it difficult to capture the heterogeneity of tumor biological behavior — for instance, some patients with early-stage disease may still experience rapid progression. On the other hand, for patients with similar pathological characteristics, traditional indicators fail to effectively distinguish prognostic risks, resulting in a lack of precise basis for clinical treatment decisions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate more biologically meaningful biomarkers to optimize prognostic stratification in ccRCC.TN is microscopic necrosis characterized by dead and degenerated cells, ghost cells, and apoptotic debris. It is defined as exceeding the cell's own blood supply, leading to severe and chronic hypoxia and ultimately cell death.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^4300abcc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

### Presence and extent of histological tumour necrosis is an adverse prognostic factor in papillary type 1 but not in papillary type 2 renal cell carcinoma [^1c09e1ca]. Histopathology (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To date, only limited information is available on the prognostic significance of the presence and extent of histological tumour necrosis with regard to papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) types 1 and 2 subclassification. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of these pathological features on the clinical outcome in papillary subtypes.

Methods and Results

The influence of histological tumour necrosis on the clinical outcome in 177 patients with papillary RCC was evaluated. For papillary subtype 1, the presence of histological tumour necrosis was an independent negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.039), and a greater extent of necrosis (> 20%) was significantly associated with both poor disease-free and overall survival (P = 0.033 and P = 0.041, respectively). Regarding papillary subtype 2, neither the presence nor extent of histological tumour necrosis was a statistically significant negative prognostic factor.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that the presence and extent of histological tumour necrosis are independent prognosticators in papillary RCC subtype 1, but not in papillary subtype 2. Thus, previously reported conflicting data regarding the prognostic impact of tumour necrosis in papillary RCC might be explained, in part, by heterogeneous subtypes.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Determinants of treatment in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma [^89defcd7]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data

Data for this study came from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. The database includes patients in the SEER tumor registry who are covered by fee-for-service Medicare, along with all Medicare claims from the time of Medicare enrollment. We included all patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 with a first, single, stage IV cancer of the kidney, which we identified using an International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) code of C649 (kidney and renal pelvis).

We further included only patients with RCC by restricting cases to those with one of the following histologic types: clear cell adenocarcinoma; renal cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma with mixed subtype; papillary adenocarcinoma; cyst-associated renal cell carcinoma; renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type; renal cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid; collecting duct carcinoma; granular cell carcinoma; and mucinous adenocarcinoma. In addition, we limited the sample to patients age 66 or older at the time of diagnosis, and we required that patients were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (both Part A and Part B) from the time of diagnosis or until death or last follow-up. We also required patients to be covered by Medicare Part D in order to identify ST.

Variables

Analyses controlled for several demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, rurality, and marital status). An overall comorbidity score (or comorbidity weight) was computed from comorbidities identified using International Classifications of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes from inpatient and outpatient claims within one year of the date of diagnosis using the Deyo adaptation of the Charlson comorbidity index. Procedure codes from the Romano adaptation were also included. Surgery (partial or total nephrectomy) was determined from claims using ICD-9 procedure codes (55.3x, 55.4, 55.5x) and Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes (50,220, 50,225, 50,230, 50,240, 50,543, 50,545, 50,546, 50,548).

### Coding practice in national and regional kidney biopsy registries [^1f4e78e7]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition, the coding task reveals a second challenge. Some registries only code the main diagnosis "IgA nephropathy" while others code additional morphological findings. For example, a minority of registries codes the morphological reaction pattern. Moreover, if registries code for morphological patterns, then they do it in different ways. The example illustrates that an investigation of data from several registries concerning morphological reaction patterns in a particular disease would not yield reliable data. Consequently, to ensure the best use of registry data, it would be advisable to establish coding rules in addition to a common coding system.

As renal pathologists use morphological patterns as a basis of diagnostic categorization, apart from clinical correlations, it is not difficult to conceive that systems originally designed for mortality statistics (such as ICD) or for registering end-stage renal disease (such as ERA-EDTA PRD) are imperfect for registering biopsy diagnoses. Thus, this research emphasizes the need for a consensus coding system that can be used by pathologists and that maps to other, more general and interchangeable, health terminology systems.

The present study has several limitations. First, the study is constrained to regional or national kidney biopsy registries. We excluded the investigation of research consortia or time-limited research registries, single center registries and pathology databases. Second, kidney biopsy registries that do not actively publish or maintain a website may have remained undetected. However, it is unlikely that such registries would have adopted any well-established renal pathology coding system.

In conclusion, our study shows large gaps in kidney biopsy registry coverage around the globe. Among existing kidney biopsy registries, there is limited use of international coding systems, hampering comparison of findings and aggregation of data. One reason might be the perceived lack of a coding system suitable for kidney biopsies. Another main reason is the long lifespan of many kidney biopsy registries, which makes continuous updating of coding systems in relation to knowledge increase challenging. There is a need for an international coding system that meets the needs of kidney biopsy registries in order to utilize the potential of these registries.

### Incidence and in-hospital mortality of acute kidney injury (AKI) and dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI-D) after cardiac catheterization in the national inpatient sample [^21f3df8e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We used National Inpatient Sample (NIS) discharge data from 2001 to 2011. The NIS is a yearly nationally‐representative, stratified sample of ≈20% of community‐based hospitals in the United States, making it the largest US all‐payer inpatient database available to researchers. 15 Thirty‐three states (986 hospitals) contributed over 7 400 000 discharge records to this database in 2001. The NIS grew to 46 states, 1049 hospitals, and over 8 000 000 discharge records by 2011. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College waived required approval for this study because the NIS contains no protected health information and is publicly available.

Our study cohort consisted of hospitalizations requiring PCI or cardiac catheterization during the study period. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) procedure and diagnosis codes were used to identify and describe these patients. We defined PCI or cardiac catheterization cases using any of the following ICD‐9‐CM codes: 0066 (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty); 3601 to 3609 (operations on vessels of heart); 3722 to 3723 (diagnostic procedures on heart and pericardium); or 8853 to 8857 (angiocardiography using contrast material).

Primary outcomes were occurrence of AKI and AKI‐D and in‐hospital mortality postcardiac catheterization or PCI. Cases of AKI were identified using the following ICD‐9‐CM codes for acute renal failure: 584.5 (with tubular necrosis); 584.6 (with lesion of renal cortical necrosis); 584.7 (with lesion of renal medullary necrosis); 584.8 (other specified pathological lesion in kidney); or 584.9 (unspecified). Cases of AKI‐D were defined as an AKI diagnosis plus a co‐listed code for hemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis (V45.1, V56.0, 39.95, V56.1, and 54.98). Records with hemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis procedure codes without an AKI diagnosis code were excluded from the analysis, as in similar investigations. 16 Patients with arteriovenous fistula creation or revision procedure codes (39.27, 39.42, 39.43, and 39.93) were excluded from analysis to increase sensitivity and specificity for acute dialysis procedures. 17

### Nabumetone [^b09f69f6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### The accuracy of diagnostic coding for acute kidney injury in england-a single centre study [^88bbec39]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Data obtained from HES for a hospital admission is comprised of one or more consecutive "episodes" of care (a period of care under a specific clinician). Each episode records a primary diagnosis (the main condition treated or investigated during this episode) and up to 19 additional secondary diagnoses.

We obtained a list of adult admissions to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England during the full calendar years 2005 and 2010, where ICD-10 code N17 (acute renal failure) was listed in any diagnostic position in any admission episode. Since ICD-10 was introduced, the term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure in clinical use but this has not yet been amended for coding purposes. Where multiple admissions for one individual occurred within the same year, only the first admission was included. We obtained a random sample of the admissions for both years and the same observer (AMR), an experienced clinician who was blinded to the study hypothesis, examined all relevant clinical records. Sample size was pragmatically chosen to enable a moderately precise estimate of patient characteristics, but without the power to detect differences between years. Patients who had been on dialysis or had a renal transplant prior to the relevant admission were excluded. The observer completed a predefined detailed summary of the demographic and clinical admission details, accessing additional computerised laboratory records where necessary.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### The ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition has not improved identification of rapidly progressing stage 3 and stage 4 chronic kidney disease patients: a diagnostic test study [^7afabda7]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system is the industry standard tool for billing, disease classification, and epidemiology purposes. Prior research has demonstrated ICD codes to have poor accuracy, particularly in relation to rapidly progressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In 2016, the ICD system moved to revision 10. This study examines subjects in a large insurer database to determine the accuracy of ICD-10 CKD-staging codes to diagnose patients rapidly progressing towards end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Patients and Methods

Serial observations of outpatient serum creatinine measurements from 2016 to 2021 of 315,903 patients were transformed to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to identify CKD stage-3 and advanced patients diagnosed clinically (eGFR-CKD). CKD-staging codes from the same time period of 59,386 patients and used to identify stage-3 and advanced patients diagnosed by ICD-code (ICD-CKD). eGFR-CKD and ICD-CKD diagnostic accuracy was compared between a total of 334,610 patients.

Results

5,618 patients qualified for the progression analysis; 72 were identified as eGFR rapid progressors; 718 had multiple codes to qualify as ICD rapid progressors. Sensitivity was 5.56%, with positive predictive value (PPV) 5.6%. 34,858 patients were diagnosed as eGFR-CKD stage-3 patients; 17,549 were also diagnosed as ICD-CKD stage-3 patients, for a sensitivity of 50.34%, with PPV of 58.71%. 4,069 patients reached eGFR-CKD stage-4 with 2,750 ICD-CKD stage-4 patients, giving a sensitivity of 67.58%, PPV of 42.43%. 959 patients reached eGFR-CKD stage-5 with 566 ICD-CKD stage-5 patients, giving a sensitivity of 59.02%, PPV of 35.85%.

Conclusion

This research shows that recent ICD revisions have not improved identification of rapid progressors in diagnostic accuracy, although marked increases in sensitivity for stage-3 (50.34% vs. 24.68%), and PPV in stage-3 (58.71% vs. 40.08%), stage-4 (42.43% vs. 18.52%), and stage-5 (35.85% vs. 4.51%) were observed. However, sensitivity in stage-5 compares poorly (59.02% vs. 91.05%).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Histologic tumor necrosis is an independent prognostic indicator for clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma [^f38c3f45]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Histologic tumor necrosis (TN) has been reported to indicate a poor prognosis for different human cancers. In papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), data regarding the prognostic impact of TN are conflicting. We retrospectively studied the pathology records of 2,333 consecutive patients who underwent nephrectomy from 1984 to 2006 at a single tertiary academic center. In multivariate analyses regarding clear cell RCC, the presence of histologic TN was an independent negative prognostic factor for metastasis-free (hazard ratio [HR], 2.32; confidence interval [CI] 1.86–2.9; P < .001) and overall (HR, 1.52; CI, 1.31–1.76; P < .001) survival. Regarding papillary RCC, the presence of histologic TN represented an independent predictor of metastasis-free (HR, 5.22; CI, 2.2–12.5; P < .001) and overall (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.11–2.58; P = 0.015) survival. Our findings suggest that the presence of TN is an independent predictor of clinical outcome in clear cell and papillary RCC. Thus, histologic TN might be a reliable prognostic indicator and should, therefore, routinely be examined during pathologic analysis of RCC specimens.

### Validity of international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification codes for acute renal failure [^eb07868a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Administrative and claims databases may be useful for the study of acute renal failure (ARF) and ARF that requires dialysis (ARF-D), but the validity of the corresponding diagnosis and procedure codes is unknown. The performance characteristics of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for ARF were assessed against serum creatinine-based definitions of ARF in 97,705 adult discharges from three Boston hospitals in 2004. For ARF-D, ICD-9-CM codes were compared with review of medical records in 150 patients with ARF-D and 150 control patients. As compared with a diagnostic standard of a 100% change in serum creatinine, ICD-9-CM codes for ARF had a sensitivity of 35.4%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 47.9%, and negative predictive value of 96.1%. As compared with review of medical records, ICD-9-CM codes for ARF-D had positive predictive value of 94.0% and negative predictive value of 90.0%. It is concluded that administrative databases may be a powerful tool for the study of ARF, although the low sensitivity of ARF codes is an important caveat. The excellent performance characteristics of ICD-9-CM codes for ARF-D suggest that administrative data sets may be particularly well suited for research endeavors that involve patients with ARF-D.

### Adverse histopathologic characteristics in small papillary renal cell carcinomas have minimal impact on prognosis [^0920af66]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Tumor size has long been used in the management decision-making of patients with renal masses. Active surveillance had recently gained traction in selected patients with tumor size of 4cm or less. Adverse histopathologic characteristics in papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis. We aimed to study whether such features in small PRCCs provide additional prognostic information.

Methods

Nephrectomies from our institution were collected and reviewed to evaluate for adverse histopathologic features. Clinical follow-up information was collected for all cases. Relationships between the variables were examined by Wilcoxon test and logistic regression.

Results

We identified 291 consecutive cases of PRCC. Adverse tumor histopathologic characteristics were significantly related to size. In PRCCs with size greater than 4 cm, there were more cases with high World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology grade and necrosis. Adverse histologic features are less commonly seen in small PRCC and are not associated with lower disease-free survival or disease-specific survival.

Conclusions

Identification of these features in small PRCCs (≤ 4cm) through needle core biopsy examination would not provide additional prognostic information in patients for whom active surveillance is considered. Clinical and radiologic follow-up in patients with small renal masses that have a known histologic diagnosis of PRCC should be sufficient.

Renal papillary necrosis

Renal papillae are present at the apex of the renal pyramid at the site where urine is discharged from the renal tubules. Papillary necrosis occurs secondary to ischemia and can be triggered by a number of factors, the most common ones being analgesic nephropathy, diabetes, sickle cell disease, and infection. Histologically, renal papillary necrosis (RPN) appears as coagulative necrosis, characterized by a pale centre with surrounding inflammatory cells. Symptoms of RPN most commonly include fevers, chills, flank pain, and hematuria. Sloughed papillae can cause ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis, further worsening renal function. The platinum based agents, cisplatin and nedaplatin, are associated with RPN. Care needs to be taken in interpretation of this pathological outcome as it can be difficult to determine whether the cause is the chemotherapy itself or chronic analgesic use since cancer patients are often on powerful analgesic regimens.

Imaging findings

Urographic findings are diagnostic with irregular contour of the renal papillae and widening of the fornixes (Fig. 4a). After sloughing of the papilla, contrast penetrates the renal parenchyma and ring shaped shadows appear to demonstrate the detached papilla, the so-called ball on a tee sign. Sonographically, renal papillary necrosis appears as multiple cystic spaces in the medullary region arranged around the renal sinus echoes. Necrosed papilla appear as nonshadowing soft tissue masses within the ureter which cannot be differentiated from other pathologies such as blood clots. Hydronephrosis which has similar findings can be differentiated from renal papillary necrosis by the presence of a central dilation of the pelvis. On CT, renal papillary necrosis is characterized by excavation of the calyces, regression of the papillae, detached papilla in the ureter, and blunting of the calyces (Fig. 4b).

### Etodolac [^71209045]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly of debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at a greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^d65eb669]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that in a large, harmonized dataset such as N3C, we are not able to differentiate clinical diagnosis codes (i.e. a code entered by a provider to signify "this patient has this disease", often as part of an EHR Problem List) and billing diagnosis codes (i.e. a code entered by a provider or medical coder to support billing or insurance reimbursement for the visit) with high certainty. Use of the U09.9 code in both contexts is important to examine; in this analysis, those contexts are combined.

Data from 34 of the 76 N3C sites were used for this analysis. The remaining sites either (1) did not use the U09.9 code in their N3C data or had not refreshed data since November 1, 2021, meaning the U09.9 code would not be present even if used at the site (n = 21 sites); (2) had location data missing for all patients (n = 12 sites); or (3) did not meet the minimum criteria we set for site data for all RECOVER-related analyses (n = 9 sites): (a) ≥ 25% of inpatients with at least one white blood cell count and at least one serum creatinine (to ensure lab measurement completeness); (b) 75% of inpatient visits have valid end dates; and (c) dates must not be shifted by the site more than 30 days. Additional N3C data quality criteria have been described previously, and also apply to this work; a summary of these checks is included in Additional file 1: Supplemental Methods. The 34 sites used here are diverse in geographic location and institution size, but cannot be specifically named due to N3C governance policies. Though the N3C data are harmonized, there is variation in the timing of U09.9 uptake among the 34 sites. A visualization of these temporal differences is included as Additional file 1: Supplemental Fig. 1.

### Safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with IgA nephropathy: a retrospective cohort study from the triNetX global collaborative networks [^0953f681]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of population of IgAN: inclusion and exclusion criteria

The study population of IgAN was defined based on ICD-10 code D80.2, comprising individuals aged 20 years or older, in accordance with the IRB regulations at TCVGH. To conduct this search on the global collaborative network of TriNetX, we applied a time constraint within five years (from September 11, 2018 to September 11, 2023). We included only IgAN patients who tested definitely negative for COVID-19 infection. Patients without a test or those who tested positive were excluded. All the detailed selections for this cohort are presented in Fig. 1 A and B. In both groups, patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (ICD-10-CM N18.6) were excluded from the study.

In TriNetX collaborative network, the entire case number of IgAN (≥ 20 y/o) is 11760 according to ICD-10 code D80.2. For renal biopsy-proved IgAN (codes for renal biopsy were CPT 1008085, 50200, 50205, 1027857, 77012, 88305, 88348, 88346, and 88313; and SNOMED: 769246001, 274326000, 175967008, 175962002, and 1727790008), the case number is 4688 (39.9%). In our cohort, case number of renal biopsy-proved IgAN is 479 in vaccinated group, and 1113 in non-vaccinated group, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of renal biopsy-proved IgAN is 47.4% and 48.9%, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis (before outbreak of Omicron, October 31 2021), the proportional for renal-biopsy proved IgAN is 51.1% for vaccinated group and 59.7% for non-vaccinated group, respectively.

The treatment group, which received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, was identified using the COVID-19 related vaccination code (Supplementary Table S1). The COIVD-19 infection status (Supplementary Table S1) was confirmed by COVID-19 PCR test, other COVID-19 related test other than PCR, and ICD-10-CM U70.1.

### Chemotherapy-related complications in the kidneys and collecting system: an imaging perspective [^19c1d65c]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nephrotoxicity is a common adverse effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. A major contributing factor is the renal excretion of the majority of these agents. Damage is often identifiable clinically by changes in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein, and urine output. The most common agents causing chemotherapy-associated nephrotoxicity include cisplatin, methotrexate, mithramycin semustine, and streptozocin. Certain chemotherapeutic agents have adverse renal and urothelial effects that can be visualized radiographically including cystic change, interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, urothelial changes, haemorrhagic cystitis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and infarction. This review focuses on imaging features identifying complications of chemotherapy in the kidneys and collecting system and provides didactic cases to alert referring clinicians (Table 1).

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Coding practice in national and regional kidney biopsy registries [^fdcbf7fd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The percutaneous kidney biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose renal disease, especially glomerulonephritis. Microscopic examination of kidney tissue gives information about diagnosis and pathogenesis and provides insight in activity and chronicity, thereby influencing therapeutic decision-making and determining prognosis.

Almost all renal diseases are orphan diseases. The small number of cases is an obstacle to gather experience for nephrologists and pathologists, facing the overlap and variety of clinical presentations, the complexity of histologic patterns and the many additional clinical data and laboratory values that are needed to interpret kidney biopsies adequately. The rarity of renal diseases also hinders the collection of a sufficient number of cases for research. This is why nephrology and renal pathology often are practiced in larger hospitals or hospital networks with regional or national collaborations. Even if networks and collaborations greatly facilitate teaching, research and policy-making, there is still need for large patient and biopsy series in order to better understand kidney disease and optimize treatment and care. As a result, kidney biopsy registries have been established.

Registries compile knowledge, foster collaboration and provide research data. Medical registries systematically collect a defined set of data from patients with specific health characteristics in a central database for a specific purpose. Several clinical kidney registries exist, of which the United States Renal Data System and the ERA-EDTA Registry are probably the best known. However, these registries focus on chronic kidney disease and renal replacement therapy and mainly collect clinical diagnoses and clinical data. The scope of these registries is not kidney biopsy diagnosis or pathology data. In comparison to these well-known big clinical registries, little is known about the number, the size and the geographic distribution of specific kidney biopsy registries.

If little data exist about kidney biopsy registries, the coding practice of these registries is even less known. A coding system eliminates the variability inherent to spoken or written language and thus can be used to store, aggregate and exchange data. In the context of kidney biopsy registries, important information from a pathology report will be stored as codes. Primarily this applies to the pathology diagnosis, but also morphologic findings or reaction patterns might be coded. If the joint usage of a coding system is crucial for aggregation and exchange of data on rare diseases, it seems strange that so little is known about coding systems used by kidney biopsy registries.

In view of these issues, our study aims to (1) give an overview over kidney biopsy registries, (2) explore how these registries code renal disease and (3) identify needs for improvement of coding practice.

### Clinical and pathological features associated with prognosis in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma [^73c7ab03]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the clinical and pathological features associated with death from papillary renal cell carcinoma in 395 surgically treated patients.

Materials and Methods

Papillary renal cell carcinoma tissue slides from each patient were reviewed for type (1 or 2), grade, TNM stage, coagulative tumor necrosis and sarcomatoid differentiation. Associations of clinical and pathological features with death from renal cell carcinoma were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and summarized by the HR and 95% CI. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

Univariate analysis revealed that symptoms, tumor thrombus, tumor size, perinephric/renal sinus fat invasion, 2010 primary tumor classification, regional lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, 2010 TNM stage group, grade, tumor necrosis, sarcomatoid differentiation and papillary renal cell carcinoma type were associated with death from renal cell carcinoma. Grade was more strongly associated with death from renal cell carcinoma than papillary renal cell carcinoma type. Multivariate analysis indicated that symptoms, 2010 TNM stage group and grade jointly were significantly associated with death from renal cell carcinoma.

Conclusions

This large series of patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma reveals features associated with death from renal cell carcinoma and confirms that grade is more predictive of outcome than papillary renal cell carcinoma type.

### A genome-wide association study of susceptibility to upper urinary tract infections [^0e889bbd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Population Used in Genome-wide Association Analyses

We used individual-level data from the UK Biobank and HUNT for the genome-wide association analyses and summary-level data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). All subjects were of European ancestry (Supplementary Text, Cohort's description).

Phenotype

In this study, we evaluated the risk of upper UTIs using hospital diagnosis codes of UTIs above the bladder (ie, involving the ureters and kidney). The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes retrieved from hospital records were used to identify cases and controls. For each cohort, cases and controls were drawn from the same population. Cases were participants with at least 1 inpatient ICD-9/10 code as a primary or secondary code for upper UTIs, while participants with no ICD-9/10 (primary or secondary diagnosis) for upper UTIs were used as controls. The same ICD-9/10 codes were used to identify cases for all analyses: ICD-9 code 590 (infections of the kidney) and ICD-10 codes N10 (acute pyelonephritis) and N12 (tubelo-interstitial nephritis, not specified as acute or chronic). Field IDs used for UK Biobank are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 200 mg) [^6954ade0]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hepatic Effects

Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib. If clinical signs and symptoms

consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.

5.6 Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of

an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver

dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored Carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.

5.6 Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### Propoxyphene napsylate and acetominophen [^c01cd5c8]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In a survey conducted in hospitalized patients, less than 1% of patients taking propoxyphene hydrochloride at recommended doses experienced side effects. The most frequently reported were dizziness, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.

Other adverse reactions include constipation, abdominal pain, skin rashes, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, euphoria, dysphoria, hallucinations, and minor visual disturbances.

Liver dysfunction has been reported in association with both active components of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets, USP. Propoxyphene therapy has been associated with abnormal liver function tests and, more rarely, with instances of reversible jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice). Hepatic necrosis may result from acute overdose of acetaminophen (see Management of Overdosage). In chronic ethanol abusers, this has been reported rarely with short-term use of acetaminophen dosages of 2.5 to 10 g/day. Fatalities have occurred.

Renal papillary necrosis may result from chronic acetaminophen use, particularly when the dosage is greater than recommended and when combined with aspirin.

Subacute painful myopathy has occurred following chronic propoxyphene overdosage.

### Hypertension increases PPV for polycystic kidney disease in PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers [^5426df33]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenotypes

UKB data were provided from the UKB resource (accessed September 2022). International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth and Tenth Revision codes and associated dates (both ICD-9 and ICD-10) were collected from inpatient data (category 2000), cancer register (category 100092), and the first occurrences (category 1712), which records the earliest instance of a diagnosis from the primary care data, hospital inpatient data, death register records, and self-reported medical conditions mapped to an ICD-10 code at a 3-character resolution (i.e. E11 instead of E11.0). Helix cohort phenotypes were processed from Epic/Clarity EHR data as previously described and updated as of January 2023. ICD codes and associated dates (ICD-9 and ICD-10-Clinical Modification [CM]) were collected from available diagnosis tables (from problem lists, medical histories, admissions data, surgical case data, account data, claims, and invoices). All datasets were transformed into the OMOP Common Data Model version 5.4. Therefore, diagnosis codes were mapped to SNOMED terms and represented by concept IDs. To be comprehensive in our cohort definition, we used both the source concept ID and the standard concept ID to extract relevant codes.

Clinical diagnosis definition

Phenotypes were defined by diagnosis included in the EHR. HTN, KD, and ESKD were defined by phecode review, as well as a literature search around clinical diagnosis codes (ICD-10, ICD-10-CM, ICD-9, SNOMED) given the different natures of the source datasets. Because all diagnoses were mapped to SNOMED, we identified the first record of each included SNOMED term to represent the first occurrence of disease for the associated individual. KD included instances of codes comprising CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or ESKD (the updated Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] terminology guideline), ADPKD, and HTN secondary to KD (indicating the presence of KD). The first incidence of any code falling into each category was considered the first diagnosis date for each category. A complete list of diagnosis codes and mapped SNOMED terms corresponding to each phenotype (HTN, KD, and ESRD) can be found in Tables S2–S4, respectively.

### Coding practice in national and regional kidney biopsy registries [^60e853f4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Most registries use proprietary coding systems. In this study, we did not investigate specifically why people prefer proprietary coding systems. It is very likely, though, that the use of proprietary coding systems is related to the fact that many international terminologies are not designed for pathology purposes. International coding systems covering pathology needs such as SNOMED and SNOMED CT are highly complex. Practical application of these systems might be hampered due to heterogeneity or lack of renal disease classifications in the past. Another reason could be the way registries are established and managed. This is often done by enthusiastic committed medical professionals. Informaticians and coding experts are probably rarely involved. At least, our survey shows in terms of coding, that only one registry had coding assistance by an informatician or coding expert and an epidemiologist.

Sometimes these proprietary systems are mapped to international terminologies, though often they are not. Clearly, data collection in regional or national registries in itself is a tool to standardize coding of diagnoses from different centers. However, when no mapping is available, the downsides of proprietary coding systems are obvious: since clinical concepts have many synonyms, the terms chosen by registries for a specific concept will be variable. Of course, code values will differ from system to system. Therefore, there is no means to easily exchange data with other registries, countries or even consortia.

Our coding task for registries "kidney biopsy with IgA nephropathy" highlights these difficulties. As IgA nephropathy is one of the most common nephropathies worldwide, the entity is relatively straightforward to code and this coding task is a daily routine in all registries. However, comparison or aggregation based on key information – the diagnosis IgA nephropathy - is not possible without profound manual interaction because terms used are different and a unique code is missing. If already a common entity like IgA nephropathy requires manual interaction to aggregate data, it is easy to anticipate how difficult it would be to compare and aggregate data from rare kidney diseases, morphological patterns or key histological findings. These observations clearly underline the necessity for a common coding system.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) — Prolonged warm ischemia followed by reperfusion in mammalian kidneys produces extensive necrosis destroying the proximal tubules of the outer stripe of the medulla, with proximal convoluted tubules becoming necrotic as well, while distal nephron involvement is minimal unless medullary oxygenation is specifically targeted. Although these animals develop severe ARF, not much else resembles the clinical syndrome in humans, and the term "acute tubular necrosis" does not accurately reflect the morphological changes in this condition.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^bbf51557]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms are an essential part of data collection for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 surveillance and research, but symptom-specific ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and fail to capture many patients with relevant symptoms; the false-negative rate is unacceptably high. Common data models and other aggregation tools rely heavily on ICD-10 codes to capture clinical concepts; inaccuracy has implications for any downstream scientific discovery or surveillance. For example, symptom surveillance could be important to detect subsequent waves of COVID-19, similar to the US Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network. A substantial number of patients would be missed if ICD-10 codes were used for this task.

ICD-10 codes are known to lack accuracy for clinical diagnoses and concepts. For example, ICD-10 codes perform poorly to identify patients with atrial fibrillation, with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 42%. Similar inaccuracies have been reported for other conditions, such as stroke and acute kidney injury. Our work represents clinician documentation of symptoms, and clinicians may not document all symptoms for all patients, particularly when patient volume is high or in drive-through testing scenarios. In other words, clinician documentation is not necessarily the "gold standard", but rather a reference standard. Other strategies include checklist type data entry to support standardized data collection or capturing symptoms directly from the patient. Several public health agencies are developing smartphone applications that allow people to report symptoms directly to appropriate officials. For health care systems, patient-reported outcomes may allow more reliable symptom capture, without reliance on billing codes or clinician documentation.

Our findings highlight the importance of quality control in COVID-19 data aggregation, which has become increasingly important with recent high-profile journal retractions. Critical data elements require careful validation to ensure that discoveries translate into effective interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality. As with many aspects of this pandemic, we must pay careful attention to socioeconomically vulnerable populations, including racial minorities, rural patients, and low-income patients, for whom the gap between ICD-10 coding and clinical reality could be greater.

Methods

SHARP study population

Details of the design of the SHARP trial and its main results have been reported previously. Briefly, individuals aged 40 years or over were eligible to participate if they had more than one previous measurement of serum or plasma creatinine of at least 1.7 mg/dL (150 μmol/L) in men or 1.5 mg/dL (130 μmol/L) in women, or were receiving maintenance dialysis. Patients with prior myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization were excluded. Between 2003 and 2006, 9,270 patients from 18 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australasia provided written informed consent and were randomized and followed for a median of 4.9 years until the end of the study in 2010. Ethical approval for SHARP was given by the Thames Valley Multicentre Research Ethics committee. The 1,928 (21%) patients recruited in Asia were excluded from the analysis presented here because there were important differences in the case-mix of hospital events and substantially lower rates of hospitalization for major vascular events, compared to patients from other regions.

Serious adverse events

Following randomization, patients were followed up at study clinics at 2 and 6 months, and then every 6 months. At each follow-up visit, information on all hospital admissions and possible study outcomes was recorded. If a patient became unwilling or unable to attend follow-up visits, information was sought from them (or a relative or carer) by telephone or from their doctor until the scheduled study end. Further information was sought from hospital records and other appropriate sources for all events that might represent an important study outcome. Trained clinicians adjudicated important study outcomes in accordance with pre-specified definitions. All diagnoses were subsequently coded into the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) system and all procedures into the Operating Code Supplement (OPCS-4.5) system. For the purpose of the hospital cost analysis, follow-up time was divided into annual periods from the date of randomization to the end of study. Only fully observed annual periods and annual periods shorter than one year due to death were included in the cost analysis.

### The ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition has not improved identification of rapidly progressing stage 3 and stage 4 chronic kidney disease patients: a diagnostic test study [^c1096a54]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study utilized claims data from a large third party insurer, servicing over 1.3 million patients across the Western New York and Albany areas of New York State. Consisting of ten years of data from 2011 to 2021, prior research has explored this rich database. Focusing on the five-year period from 2016 to 2021, this study examines ICD-10 coding accuracy in the context of CKD. Patients with stage-3 CKD were identified using measured serum creatinine values and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using a modified eGFR formula to exclude race. With unique patient identifiers and observation dates, these eGFR values were linked to diagnostic ICD codes.

Based on clinician interpretation of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives (KDOQI) guidelines, patients with serum creatinine, age, and gender had eGFR values calculated. Those with two eGFR measures less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at least ninety days apart, with no intervening measurement greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², were identified by their eGFR as stage-3, stage-4, or stage-5 CKD cases. Limited presence of lab values precluded albuminuria-based stage 1 and stage 2 CKD diagnosis. Individuals with laboratory-confirmed CKD are referred to as eGFR-CKD.

CKD patients were alternatively identified using ICD-10-CM codes. The following code groups were considered: Chronic Kidney Disease (N18.1, N18.2, N18.3, N18.4, N18.5, N18.6, N18.9), Hypertensive CKD and hypertensive heart and CKD (I12.0, I12.9, I13.0, I13.1, I13.10, I13.11, I13.2), and diabetic mellitus with CKD (E08.21, E08.22, E08.29, E09.21, E09.22, E09.29, E10.21, E10.22, E10.29, E11.21, E11.22, E11.29, E13.21, E13.22, E13.29). Patients with at least one occurrence of any code were classified as ICD-CKD.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^178b52ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Surveillance of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is critical for monitoring maternal health and evaluating clinical quality improvement efforts.

Objective

To evaluate national and state trends in SMM rates from 2012 to 2019 and potential disruptions associated with the transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) in October 2015.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional analysis examined delivery hospitalizations from 2012 through 2019 in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases, an all-payer compendium of hospital discharge records from community, nonrehabilitation hospitals. Trends were evaluated using segmented linear binomial regression models that allowed for discontinuities across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Analyses were completed from April 2021 through March 2022.

Exposures

Time, ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system, and state.

Main Outcomes and Measures

SMM rates, excluding blood transfusion, per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations, overall and by indicator.

Results

From 2012 to 2019, there were 5 964 315 delivery hospitalizations in the national sample representing a weighted total of 29.8 million deliveries with a mean (SD) maternal age of 28.6 (5.9) years. SMM rates increased from 69.5 per 10 000 in 2012 to 79.7 per 10 000 in 2019 (rate difference [RD], 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, -3.2; 95% CI, -6.9 to 0.6). Of 20 SMM indicators, rates for 10 indicators significantly increased while 3 significantly decreased; 5 of these changes were associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Acute kidney failure had the largest increase, from 6.4 to 15.3 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 8.9; 95% CI, 7.5 to 10.3) with no change associated with ICD transition (RD, -0.1; 95% CI, -1.2 to 1.1). Disseminated intravascular coagulation had the largest decrease from 31.3 to 21.2 per 10 000 (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, -12.8 to -7.5), with a significant drop associated with ICD transition (RD, -7.9; 95% CI, -10.2 to -5.6). State SMM rates significantly decreased for 1 state and significantly increased for 21 states from 2012 to 2019 and associations with ICD transition varied.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, overall US SMM rates increased from 2012 to 2019, which was not associated with the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. However, data for certain indicators and states may not be comparable across coding systems; efforts are needed to understand SMM increases and state variation.

### Association of osteopontin and selective glomerular hypofiltration syndrome with hospitalization for kidney failure in acute heart failure patients [^f23a8929]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions

The diagnosis of heart failure was based on a combination of diagnostic imaging, NTproBNP-levels and/or the clinical assessment of the attending physician resulting in the diagnostic ICD-10 codes of I50.0-I50.9. Prevalent SGHS was defined as eGFR cys /eGFR crea < 0.6. Body mass index (BMI) was defined as kg/m². "Acute kidney failure" included ICD-10 codes N17.0-N17.9; N17.0: Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis, N17.1: Acute kidney failure with acute cortical necrosis, N17.2: Acute kidney failure with medullary necrosis, N17.8: Other acute kidney failure and N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified. "All kidney failures" was defined as ICD-10 codes N17.0-N17.9 as mentioned above and including chronic kidney disease N18-18.5, N18.9: Chronic kidney disease, unspecified and N19: Unspecified kidney failure.

Use of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-inhibitors) was defined as use of either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Use of diuretics was defined as the use of either loop- or thiazide diuretics.

Laboratory assays

Blood samples were collected at admission as well as during hospital stay in a fasting condition. Blood samples were stored at − 80 °C. Plasma cystatin C was analyzed at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Skåne University Hospital, using an automated particle-based immunoassay, adjusted to the international reference preparation ERM-DA 471/IFCC, (Hitachi Modular P analysis system; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). P-creatinine was measured using an enzymatic colorimetric assay with an IDMS-traceable calibrator on the Hitachi Modular P analysis system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The revised Lund-Malmö equation was used to calculate eGFR crea and the Caucasian-Asian-Pediatric-Adult (CAPA) equation was used to calculate eGFR cys. A proximity extension array technique, using Proseek Multiplex CVD III 96 × 96 reagents kit (Olink, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for determination of plasma concentrations of OPN. The final proteomic assay readout was given as normalized protein expression, an arbitrary unit given on a log2 scale meaning that each unit increase corresponds to a doubling in concentration.

We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman with a history of sickle cell trait (SCT) who presented with several months of hematuria and was found to have nutcracker syndrome (NCS). While SCT is a common cause of hematuria resulting from renal papillary necrosis, our patient had concomitant abdominal pain and anemia, prompting further evaluation and the subsequent diagnosis of NCS. Interestingly, the anoxia in the left renal vein from NCS predisposes patients with SCT to sickling. Our case highlights key clinical features of both NCS and SCT and the relationship between the two disease processes.

### Coding practice in national and regional kidney biopsy registries [^0fe64f83]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney biopsy registries all over the world benefit research, teaching and health policy. Comparison, aggregation and exchange of data is however greatly dependent on how registration and coding of kidney biopsy diagnoses are performed. This paper gives an overview over kidney biopsy registries, explores how these registries code kidney disease and identifies needs for improvement of coding practice.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken to identify biopsy registries for medical kidney diseases. These data were supplemented with information from personal contacts and from registry websites. A questionnaire was sent to all identified registries, investigating age of registries, scope, method of coding, possible mapping to international terminologies as well as self-reported problems and suggestions for improvement.

Results

Sixteen regional or national kidney biopsy registries were identified, of which 11 were older than 10years. Most registries were located either in Europe (10/16) or in Asia (4/16). Registries most often use a proprietary coding system (12/16). Only a few of these coding systems were mapped to SNOMED CT (1), older SNOMED versions (2) or ERA-EDTA PRD (3). Lack of maintenance and updates of the coding system was the most commonly reported problem.

Conclusions

There were large gaps in the global coverage of kidney biopsy registries. Limited use of international coding systems among existing registries hampers interoperability and exchange of data. The study underlines that the use of a common and uniform coding system is necessary to fully realize the potential of kidney biopsy registries.

### Molecularly targeted cancer medications and kidney health [^1fe8f10d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study in the Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) including EHR data from approximately 4 million patients seen within the Stanford Hospital, Tri-Valley Hospital, and outpatient clinics throughout the San Francisco Bay Area since 2008. The study received institutional review board approval from Stanford University. The requirement for informed consent was waived because because data were deidentified, in accordance with 45 CFR §46. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for cohort studies.

The OMOP Common Data Model systematically transforms data from observational databases into a common format (data model) with common terminologies, vocabularies, and coding schemes.OMOP concept identifiers are standardized medical codes for diagnoses, procedures, medication orders, and laboratory test orders (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), Current Procedural Terminology or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier, and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes, respectively).

### Acute kidney injury, the present on admission (POA) indicator and sex disparities: observational study of inpatient real-world data in a Swiss tertiary healthcare system. explorative analysis [^bd281d46]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Data management

All the datasets were merged by using the inpatient case number serving as unique identification (case ID). Cases without POA values and cases missing in cost or movement datasets were deleted. Cases without PCCL values were kept since the individual diagnosis-related Complication and Comorbidity Level (CCL) values were used to calculate the PCCL. The approach used was:

(1) Order CCL scores from biggest to smallest for each case; (2) Add a column for row number starting to 1; (3) Calculate CCL*e −(row−1)∗ 0.4 for each row; (4) Sum all the above values per case; (5) Calculateand (6) Round result to get 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 (values higher than 4 are forced to 4). The data were deidentified from the start and any sensitive information was deleted.

Variables

POA indicator

The inclusion list of diagnoses to be reported is based on the hospital-acquired complications list published by The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. The technical implementation into the coding workplacetook place in 2017.

The POA coding adhered to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) ICD-10 Clinical Modification, Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, fiscal year 2017 Appendix I. Captured values were: (1) Yes = Diagnosis present at time of inpatient admission; (2) No = Diagnosis not present at time of inpatient admission; (3) U (unknown) = Documentation insufficient to determine if the condition was present at inpatient admission; (4) W (clinically undetermined) = Provider unable to clinically determine whether the condition was present at inpatient admission and (5) NA (not assigned) = blank.

For this study, we collapsed the different POA categories into two: (1) 'POA no' referring to healthcare-associated conditions and 'POA yes' (including yes, W, NA and U) referring to conditions present at admission.

Sex

In alignment with the WHO and the reported data in the hospitals' administrative system, we defined the variable sex as the "biological category based on reproductive, anatomical, and genetic characteristics, generally defined as male, female, and intersex". For the current study, only the answer options 'male' and 'female' were available, values for biological intersex were not captured.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^0599b312]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Renal mass and localized renal cancer — initial evaluation and diagnosis emphasizes that in patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, clinicians should obtain high quality, multiphase, cross-sectional abdominal imaging to optimally characterize and clinically stage the renal mass, including assessment of tumor complexity, degree of contrast enhancement (where applicable), and presence or absence of necrosis (Clinical Principle). In patients with suspected renal malignancy, clinicians should obtain a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis, and metastatic evaluation should include chest imaging to evaluate for possible thoracic metastases (Clinical Principle). For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, clinicians should assign chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and degree of proteinuria (Expert Opinion).

### Systematic review for the 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^3d191888]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention ICD — comorbidities and chronic kidney disease (CKD) meta-analysis: A meta-analysis included all 10 studies of patients with comorbidities, with a separate analysis of 5 studies of renal dysfunction; in both, a random effects model showed improved all-cause mortality versus no ICD. Of the 10 studies, 6 were retrospective observational and 4 incorporated data from 4 RCTs (MADIT-I, MADIT-II, DEFINITE, SCD-HeFT). Most patients were from observational studies (~62% overall; ~65% renal analysis). The overall HR of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.79; P < 0.001) favored ICD, and in renal disease there was evidence of overall benefit (HR: 0.71).
