## Question

What are the differences between QuantiFERON-TB and PPD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to compare QuantiFERON-TB (an IGRA) and PPD/Mantoux (the tuberculin skin test), highlighting key differences and practical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each test measures and how it is performed. Then, I should verify the antigenic basis and its impact on specificity, especially with BCG and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Next, I will review sensitivity estimates and the absence of a gold standard for latent TB. After that, I need to evaluate logistical considerations and sources of variability. I will now examine test concordance and typical discordance patterns. Finally, I should integrate clinical interpretation, including predictive value for progression and guideline context, and conclude with a concise synthesis of when one test might be preferred over the other.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental nature of each test. PPD (tuberculin skin test) is an in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test that requires intradermal injection of purified protein derivative and a return visit at 48–72 hours to measure induration, with results subject to reader variability, whereas QuantiFERON-TB is an in vitro interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) that measures IFN-γ production from sensitized T cells after stimulation with TB-specific antigens in a single blood draw, yielding an objective laboratory result in IU/mL [^11483xEJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the antigenic differences because they drive specificity. TST uses complex PPD containing multiple shared antigens that can cross-react with BCG strains and many nontuberculous mycobacteria, lowering specificity in those settings, while IGRAs use RD1 antigens such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which are absent from BCG and most NTM, thereby improving specificity, particularly among BCG-vaccinated populations [^116mwske] [^113mKZ5x]. Let me double-check that modern skin tests built on ESAT-6/CFP-10 (for example, C-Tb) also demonstrate high specificity in contact investigations, which supports the antigen-specificity principle underlying IGRAs [^113D6vzm].

> Wait, let me verify sensitivity estimates, since these are often misunderstood. With no accepted gold standard for latent TB infection, active TB is typically used as a proxy to estimate sensitivity. Pooled TST sensitivity in adults is approximately 0.80 at 5–10 mm cutoffs but falls with a 15 mm threshold, while pooled IGRA sensitivity ranges roughly from 0.81 to 0.90 in active TB cohorts; neither test distinguishes latent from active TB, and both have suboptimal sensitivity in certain populations [^11483xEJ] [^116mwske]. I should confirm that QFT-Plus does not materially increase sensitivity over the prior QFT-GIT for active disease, even with CD8-stimulating peptides, which aligns with head-to-head studies showing similar sensitivity [^115eRjAd].

> Next, I should review operational and logistical considerations. TST requires two visits and trained personnel to place and read induration, making results subject to reader variation, whereas IGRA is a single-visit blood test with objective readouts but requires timely specimen processing and laboratory infrastructure; preanalytical and analytical variability can affect IGRA reproducibility, and indeterminate results can increase in critical illness (for example, severe COVID-19), which clinicians should anticipate [^113cAjfU] [^117VkUSC] [^1133J8zJ]. Let me consider costs carefully: although TST is often cheaper per test, program-level analyses suggest that relying on TST in high-burden, highly BCG-vaccinated settings may be paradoxically costlier when missed infections later progress to disease, an issue for TB programs to model explicitly [^1161St35].

> I will now examine test concordance and typical discordance patterns. Overall agreement between TST and IGRA is often only poor to fair, with pooled kappa values around 0.27–0.32 across worker cohorts, in contrast to much stronger agreement among IGRAs themselves; discordance tends to be in the direction of TST positive and IGRA negative, especially in BCG-vaccinated individuals where TST false-positives are more likely [^1161N5Yd] [^1125yozj]. Let me double-check that occupational and cohort studies corroborate this tendency, including findings that TST positivity with negative IGRAs is strongly associated with prior BCG vaccination in US healthcare workers and that agreement with TST drops at higher induration thresholds in BCG-vaccinated groups [^114LZGcg] [^112WnQiM] [^115t4DQx].

> But wait, what about specificity differences quantified outside of overtly low-risk cohorts? I should confirm that latent class analyses and low-risk cohorts consistently show higher specificity for IGRAs than TST, particularly among foreign-born or BCG-vaccinated populations, with QuantiFERON specificity often near 98–99% in low-risk groups, which aligns with RD1 antigen specificity [^114L6nAw] [^111hALf8] [^116mwske]. Hmm, wait a minute, I must not overgeneralize — specificity estimates can vary with population and lab practices, but the overall direction favoring IGRA specificity remains robust across methodologies [^11483xEJ].

> Next, I should review prognostic performance for incident TB, since clinicians care about who will progress. IGRAs and TST both have limited positive predictive value for progression to active TB, with modest differences in hazard ratios between tests across pooled analyses; some individual participant meta-analyses suggest slightly higher predictive performance for QFT versus TST at certain cutoffs, but estimates are small, heterogeneous, and sensitive to single studies, underscoring that neither test is a strong predictor on its own [^116rFSDg] [^111YSzkb] [^1128VtaR]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines still recommend using test results in the context of risk stratification because baseline risk drives absolute benefit from preventive therapy more than small differences in test performance metrics [^1128VtaR].

> I need to ensure clinical interpretation is framed correctly. Neither TST nor IGRA distinguishes latent from active TB; both indicate immunologic sensitization, requiring integration with epidemiologic exposure, clinical assessment, and, when appropriate, microbiologic testing. Positive results should be interpreted alongside risk factors for progression, while negative results do not exclude infection in immunocompromised hosts or very recent exposures given window periods and reduced test sensitivity in some populations [^11483xEJ] [^116Kg6Mf] [^1128VtaR]. Let me reconsider monitoring utility: serial IGRA changes (reversion or conversion at low-positive levels) are often biologically and analytically noisy, limiting their role in treatment monitoring, a point supported by serial testing studies and reviews [^111fCgy9] [^117VkUSC] [^114rYSDH].

> Finally, I should synthesize the key differences and practical choices. QuantiFERON-TB, as an RD1 antigen-based IGRA, provides higher specificity than TST, especially in BCG-vaccinated or NTM-exposed populations, with comparable or slightly higher sensitivity in active TB, objective single-visit results, and known preanalytical constraints; TST is widely available, low cost, and lab-independent but requires two visits, has subjective readings, and lower specificity in BCG settings, leading to more false-positives and downstream overtreatment in some programs [^11483xEJ] [^116mwske] [^1161St35]. I should double-check that current guidance generally supports IGRA use in BCG-vaccinated adults and permits either TST or IGRA in other adults at increased risk, with choice tailored by local resources, patient factors, and program goals; emerging ESAT-6/CFP-10 skin tests may offer IGRA-like specificity in a skin-based format, but implementation and availability vary [^1128VtaR] [^113D6vzm] [^1121zvZF].

QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) is a **blood-based IGRA** that measures IFN-γ release in response to TB-specific antigens [^113tHy7s], while PPD (TST) is a **skin test** that measures delayed-type hypersensitivity to PPD [^113cAjfU]. QFT is **more specific** [^116mwske], especially in BCG-vaccinated or NTM-exposed individuals, and requires **one visit**; however, it needs laboratory infrastructure and can yield indeterminate results in immunosuppressed patients [^113jZJQq] [^116Kg6Mf]. TST is less specific due to BCG/NTM cross-reactivity [^11483xEJ], requires two visits, and is operator-dependent, although it is inexpensive and widely available [^1161St35]. QFT is preferred for BCG-vaccinated individuals, immunocompromised patients, or those unlikely to return; TST is suitable for low-risk, non-BCG-vaccinated populations or in resource-limited settings [^1161St35] [^117X3Z6V]. Neither test distinguishes **latent from active TB** [^116mwske], so clinical context guides use [^11483xEJ].

## Test principles and methodologies

| **Test** | **Principle** | **Methodology** |
|-|-|-|
| QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) | - Blood-based IGRA <br/> - Measures IFN-γ release from T cells in response to TB-specific antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, TB7.7) [^113tHy7s] | - Single blood draw <br/> - Laboratory processing <br/> - Results in 24–48 hours [^11483xEJ] |
| Purified protein derivative (PPD) | - Skin test <br/> - Measures delayed-type hypersensitivity to PPD | - Intradermal injection <br/> - Induration measured at 48–72 hours [^113cAjfU] |

---

## Sensitivity and specificity

- **QFT specificity**: Higher than TST, especially in BCG-vaccinated or NTM-exposed individuals [^116mwske] [^117X3Z6V].
- **TST specificity**: Lower due to cross-reactivity with BCG and NTM [^11483xEJ].
- **QFT sensitivity**: Comparable to TST in immunocompetent adults, but may be lower in immunocompromised patients [^113mKZ5x] [^11483xEJ] [^116Kg6Mf].

---

## Clinical advantages and limitations

| **Test** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) | - Higher specificity <br/> - Single visit <br/> - Not affected by BCG <br/> - Objective results [^117X3Z6V] [^11483xEJ] | - Requires lab infrastructure <br/> - Higher cost <br/> - Indeterminate results in immunosuppressed [^1161St35] [^113jZJQq] |
| Purified protein derivative (PPD) | - Inexpensive <br/> - Widely available <br/> - Simple to administer [^1161St35] | - Lower specificity <br/> - Two visits <br/> - Subjective reading <br/> - False positives with BCG/NTM [^112WnQiM] [^11483xEJ] |

## Impact of BCG vaccination and immunosuppression

BCG vaccination does not affect QFT, whereas TST can yield **false positives** [^116mwske]. In the setting of **immunosuppression**, both tests may have reduced sensitivity, and QFT can produce indeterminate results [^116Kg6Mf] [^113jZJQq].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Cost**: QFT is more expensive than TST [^1161St35].
- **Turnaround time**: QFT results in 24–48 hours; TST requires 48–72 hours and a return visit.
- **Patient compliance**: QFT needs one visit; TST needs two.

---

## Clinical scenarios and guidelines

QFT is preferred for **BCG-vaccinated individuals, immunocompromised patients, or those unlikely to return**, whereas TST is preferred for **low-risk, non-BCG-vaccinated populations or in resource-limited settings** [^1161St35].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **QFT**: Higher specificity, single visit, unaffected by BCG; requires lab infrastructure and is costlier [^11483xEJ] [^117X3Z6V].
- **TST**: Inexpensive, widely available, but lower specificity and needs two visits [^1161St35].
- **Test choice**: Base on patient factors, resources, and clinical context [^1128VtaR].

Interferon-gamma-release assays (IGRAs) are alternatives to the tuberculin skin test (TST). A recent meta-analysis showed that IGRAs have high specificity, even among populations that have received bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. Sensitivity was suboptimal for TST and IGRAs.

- **Purpose**: To incorporate newly reported evidence from 20 studies into an updated meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of IGRAs.

- **Data sources**: PubMed was searched through 31 March 2008, and citations of all original articles, guidelines, and reviews for studies published in English were reviewed.

- **Study selection**: Studies that evaluated QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (both from Cellestis, Victoria, Australia), and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) or its precommercial ELISpot version, when data on the commercial version were lacking, were included. For assessing sensitivity, the study sample had to have microbiologically confirmed active tuberculosis. For assessing specificity, the sample had to comprise healthy, low-risk individuals without known exposure to tuberculosis. Studies with fewer than 10 participants and those that included only immunocompromised participants were excluded.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^11483xEJ]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) can progress to active tuberculosis disease, causing morbidity and mortality.

To review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening and treatment of LTBI in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), data were sourced from PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and trial registries through December 3, 2021, supplemented by expert references and literature surveillance through January 20, 2023.

- **Study selection**: English-language studies addressing LTBI screening, LTBI treatment, or the accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) were included. However, studies focusing on LTBI screening and treatment for public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A dual review process of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality was conducted, accompanied by a qualitative synthesis of findings. Meta-analyses were performed when a sufficient number of similar studies were available.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Outcomes included screening test accuracy, development of active tuberculosis disease, transmission, quality of life, mortality, and harms.

Results indicated that a total of 113 publications (112 studies; N = 69,009) were included. Notably, no studies directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening. Pooled estimates for the sensitivity of the TST were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.87) at the 5-mm induration threshold, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.87) at the 10-mm threshold, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46–0.74) at the 15-mm threshold. Pooled estimates for the sensitivity of IGRA tests ranged from 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79–0.84) to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.92). Pooled estimates for specificity…

### Clinical application and limitations of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection [^113jZJQq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) represent advances in tuberculosis immunology and evolutionary biology. IGRAs were designed to replace the tuberculin skin test (TST) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection due to their logistical advantages and enhanced specificity over TST. Although IGRAs and TST have been useful in epidemiologic studies, they lack the sensitivity and reproducibility typically expected from diagnostic tests in clinical practice. In this review, we present an overview of the recommendations and knowledge in the field, and discuss practical approaches in areas of uncertainty related to discordant IGRA results.

### Specificity of QuantiFERON-TB Plus, a new-generation interferon gamma release assay [^111hALf8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are important tools in identifying prior tuberculosis exposure. The new-generation QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay, recently approved for use in the United States, differs from the current-generation QFT Gold-In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay with the addition of a second antigen tube that also contains novel CD8+ T-cell-stimulating peptides. The QFT-Plus assay has increased sensitivity in immunocompromised populations. We sought to assess the specificity of QFT-Plus compared to that of QFT-GIT in low-risk individuals.

We enrolled adults without tuberculosis risk factors, including a subgroup with pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Mycobacterium abscessus. The primary outcome measures included specificity, interassay concordance, and agreement between the QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT assays. Of 262 participants enrolled, 51 had pulmonary NTM. The median age was 39 years (age range, 18 to 78 years); 73% were female.

Among the 262 individuals who were enrolled, 5 (1.9%) individuals had positive QFT-Plus results, and 3 of these individuals also had positive QFT-GIT results. The two individuals with discordant results (QFT-Plus positive/QFT-GIT negative) had only one tube positive in the QFT-Plus assay. The overall specificity of QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 95.6%, 99.4%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.7%, 99.8%), respectively. The QFT-Plus specificity was similar in both the NTM (98.0% [95% CI, 89.4%, 99.9%]) and non-NTM (98.1% [95% CI, 95.2%, 99.5%]) groups.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection in Spanish healthcare workers: Comparison of the QuantiFERON-TB GOLD in-tube test with the tuberculin skin test [^112WnQiM]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The risk of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) in healthcare workers (HCWs) is high. Until recently, the tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only diagnostic test available for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) test, was recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an alternative test for the diagnosis of LTBI in HCWs. The purpose of our study was to compare the TST and the QFT-G test in Spanish HCWs in order to improve procedures for the detection of LTBI.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study with blinded comparison of TST and QFT-G test results was carried out among 134 HCWs at an 800-bed Spanish university hospital. The level of interferon-gamma production stimulated by the QFT-G test was measured. A concentration of at least 0.35 IU/mL was considered a positive result. An induration of at least 5 mm in non-BCG-vaccinated or at least 15 mm in BCG-vaccinated HCWs for the TST was considered positive.

- **Results**: Of the 134 HCWs included (mean age, 33.4 years; 101 [75.4%] women; 47 [35.1%] BCG vaccinated), the LTBI prevalence diagnosed with any test was 11.2% (95% confidence interval, 6.6%-18.1%), with the TST was 8.96%, and with the QFT-G test was 5.97% (nonsignificant differences). The QFT-G test value was higher in subjects with TST induration of at least 15 mm than in subjects with TST induration of less than 15 mm (P < .001). Overall agreement between the results of the two tests was found in 94% of HCWs (kappa = 0.56), but agreement was only 59% in HCWs who had a positive induration of at least 15 mm.

### Elevated rates of indeterminate results on QuantiFERON-TB GOLD Plus in COVID-19 patients [^1133J8zJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays are used to screen various patient populations for latent tuberculosis infection. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, researchers investigated an increased indeterminate rate in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay among COVID-19 patients that was independent of immunosuppressive agents and lymphopenia. In their study, COVID-19 patients with indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results trended toward decreased survival as well as increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 levels, although the differences were not statistically significant. They suggest that this pattern of cytokine expression supports an impairment of Th1, specifically interferon gamma production, in critically ill COVID-19 patients, as indicated by indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results. Clinicians should be aware of the increased rate of indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

### Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: The potential role of new technologies [^117NLC2x]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TB control programs need improvement in the diagnosis of latent TB infection. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is far from a "gold" standard, as it often gives false results. Interferon-gamma assays are newly available tests to detect latent TB infection, but they are currently not routinely used. They are based on immune responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) or to region of difference 1 (RD1) specific antigens. Assays based on RD1-specific antigens perform better than both PPD-based assays and TST. They correlate with TB exposure and are less likely to give false results in non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, and immunosuppression.

More accurate diagnosis of latent TB infection with RD1-specific antigen-based interferon-gamma assays may allow targeting of chemoprophylaxis to reduce the burden of active TB while decreasing wastage of healthcare resources due to false results associated with TST. However, further research and development are required to verify that new tests can predict the risk of later development of active TB and to make it feasible to perform these tests in a reproducible fashion at low cost, particularly in developing countries.

### Tuberculin and quantiferon-TB-GOLD tests for latent tuberculosis: A meta-analysis [^1161N5Yd]. Occupational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Up to now, there has been no universal consensus on the agreement between the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON-TB-Gold test (QFT) in the detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among high-risk populations.

- **Aims**: To estimate the agreement between TST and QFT among health care workers (HCWs).

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis in which all major electronic databases, including Medline, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Ovid, were searched until June 2014. All cross-sectional and cohort studies addressing the agreement between TST and the QFT were included. The extracted data were analyzed, and the results were reported using random effect models.

- **Results**: The overall kappa statistic between TST and the QFT was 0.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22, 0.32], and the adjusted kappa statistic for prevalence and bias was 0.41 (95% CI 0.32, 0.50). The kappa for subjects with and without bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination was 0.27 (95% CI 0.18, 0.36) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.15, 0.46) respectively. The figures were 0.30 (95% CI 0.16, 0.43) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.74, 0.90) for prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The overall agreement between TST and QFT in the detection of LTBI among HCWs was poor. After adjusting for the prevalence and bias indices, kappa statistics reached fair agreement. The utility of each of these two tests is dependent on the prevalence and burden of tuberculosis as well as the BCG vaccination status.

### Effect of isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection on QuantiFERON-TB GOLD in-tube responses in adults with positive tuberculin skin test results in a high TB incidence area: a controlled study [^1161xUUX]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are used in the diagnosis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection and could be useful biomarkers of response to treatment of latent TB infection for clinical trials, infection control units, and TB programs.

- **Methods**: This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

- **Results**: IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = 0.03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = 0.31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

- **Conclusions**: IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^116rFSDg]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

In the pair-wise comparisons of the test performance, the ratio of odds ratios for QFT-GIT vs. TST 15 mm was 1.48 (95% CI 1.03–2.13), suggesting a slightly higher predictive performance of QFT-GIT than TST 15 mm (Table S6). This was again driven by the same one study as above, and when it was excluded, the ratio declined, and its confidence interval crossed one (1.23; 95% CI 0.84–1.80). Likewise, the ratio for QFT-GIT vs. TST 5 mm/15 mm based on all studies was 1.14 (95% CI 0.72–1.81).

We compared the predictive performance of TST vs. T-SPOT.TB, using individual data from three studies with data on T-SPOT.TB. The predictive performance was similar between TST 15 mm, TST 5/15 mm, and T-SPOT.TB (Table 2 and Fig. S4). The pooled HRs for TST 15 mm and TST 5/15 mm were 7.87 (95% CI 3.42–18.12) and 5.98 (95% CI 3.51–10.21), respectively, compared to that of 6.45 (95% CI 3.32–12.55) for T-SPOT.TB, and 8.98 (95% CI 3.17–25.41) for QFT-GIT. Because of the small number of studies and events, the pooled estimates from the two-stage meta-analysis were very wide (Fig. S5).

The sensitivity analyses that used only bacteriologically confirmed TB and those using a shorter (within 14 days from enrollment) or longer (within 180 days) temporal definition of prevalent TB disease did not change the overall trends significantly (Tables S7 and S8).

Egger's test did not show evidence of publication bias (Fig. S6).

### Assessing the diagnostic performance of new commercial interferon-γ release assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125yozj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Of the 33 studies assessing the agreement between QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) and the World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed tests, 21 studies (63.6%) were classified at low risk of bias (RoB). In our primary analyses, the pooled κ statistics comparing the QFT-Plus against the QFT-GIT and the T-SPOT.TB were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.85; N = 6586 subjects) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.86; N = 3139 subjects), respectively. On the other hand, the pooled κ statistic comparing the QFT-Plus and the tuberculin skin test (TST) was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.44; N = 1312 subjects).

Of the studies assessing the agreement of the QFT-Plus chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) and the QIAreach with the QFT-Plus, 25% (1/4) and 33.3% (1/3) were classified at low RoB, respectively. In our primary analyses, the pooled κ statistics comparing the QFT-Plus CLIA and the QIAreach with the QFT-Plus were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.94; N = 1173 samples) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.00; N = 289 samples), respectively. As summarized in the supplementary material, we found very limited information regarding QFT-Plus reproducibility or its predictive ability for incident tuberculosis (TB).

### Safety and efficacy of the C-Tb skin test to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, compared with an interferon γ release assay and the tuberculin skin test: a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113D6vzm]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Targeted screening and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection substantially reduce the risk of developing active tuberculosis. C-Tb (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a novel specific skin test based on ESAT-6 and CFP10 antigens. We investigated the safety and diagnostic potential of C-Tb compared with established tests in the contact-tracing setting.

- **Methods**: Negative controls, close contacts, occasional contacts, and patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled at 13 centres in Spain. We compared C-Tb with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT] (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) interferon γ release assay (IGRA) and the purified protein derivative (PPD) RT 23 tuberculin skin test [TST] (Statens Serum Institute). All participants older than 5 years were tested with QFT. Some participants in the negative control group received C-Tb without the TST to test for potential interactions between C-Tb and PPD RT 23. The rest were randomly assigned in blocks of ten and tested with both C-Tb and TST, with five in each block receiving injection of C-Tb in the right arm and the TST in the left arm, and five vice versa. The primary and safety analyses were done in all participants randomly assigned to a group who received any test. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01631266, and with EudraCT, number 2011–005617–36.

- **Findings**: From July 24, 2012, to October 2, 2014, 979 participants were enrolled, of whom 263 were negative controls, 299 were occasional contacts, 316 were close contacts, and 101 were patients with tuberculosis.

### Comparison of three tests for latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk people in the United States: an observational cohort study [^112SXEpK]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is an important strategy to prevent tuberculosis disease. In the United States, three tests are used to identify latent tuberculosis infection: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and two IFN-γ release assays (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON). To our knowledge, few large studies have compared all three tests among people at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection or progression to tuberculosis disease. We aimed to assess test agreement between IFN-γ release assays and TST to provide guidance on their use in important risk groups.

- **Methods**: In this observational cohort study, we enrolled participants at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection or progression to tuberculosis disease at ten US sites with 18 affiliated clinics, including close contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases, people born in countries whose populations in the United States have high (≥ 100 cases per 100,000 people) or moderate (10–99 cases per 100,000 people) tuberculosis incidence, and people with HIV. Participants were interviewed about demographics and medical risk factors, and all three tests were administered to each participant. The primary endpoints for this study were the proportions of positive test results by test type, stratified by risk group, and test concordance by risk group for participants with valid results for all three test types. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01622140.

- **Findings**: Between July 12, 2012, and May 5, 2017, 26,292 people were approached, and 22,131 (84.2%) were enrolled in the study. Data from 21,846 (98.7%) participants were available.

### Interferon-gamma assays in the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis: a systematic review [^113tHy7s]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

A major challenge in tuberculosis control is the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Until recently, there were no alternatives to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis. However, an alternative has now emerged in the form of a new in-vitro test: the interferon-gamma assay. We conducted a systematic review to assess the performance of interferon-gamma assays in the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis. By searching databases, contacting experts, and reaching out to test manufacturers, we identified 75 relevant studies.

The results suggest that interferon-gamma assays using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific region of difference 1 (RD1) antigens, such as early secretory antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10, may have advantages over the TST. These advantages include higher specificity, better correlation with exposure to M. tuberculosis, and reduced cross-reactivity due to BCG vaccination and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. However, using RD1 antigens in isolation may maximize specificity at the cost of sensitivity. Assays that use cocktails of RD1 antigens seem to overcome this issue and demonstrate the highest accuracy.

RD1-based interferon-gamma assays can potentially identify individuals with latent tuberculosis who are at high risk for developing active disease, but this requires further confirmation. There is inadequate evidence on the value of interferon-gamma assays in the management of immunocompromised individuals, children, patients with extrapulmonary or non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, and various populations.

### Interferon-γ release assays or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117X3Z6V]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Use of an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay or tuberculin skin test for the detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. For both types of tests, we assessed their predictive value for the progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease, the targeting value of preventive treatment, and the necessity of dual testing.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with no start date or language restrictions, on Oct 18, 2019. We used the keywords "latent tuberculosis" OR "latent tuberculosis infection" OR "LTBI" AND "interferon gamma release assays" OR "interferon-gamma release test" OR "IGRA" OR "QuantiFERON®-TB in tube" OR "QFT" OR "T-SPOT.TB" AND "tuberculin skin test" OR "tuberculin test" OR "Mantoux test" OR "TST". We included articles that used a cohort study design, included information that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection detected by IFN-γ release assay, tuberculin skin test, or both, progressed to active tuberculosis, reported information about treatment, and were limited to high-risk populations. We excluded studies that included patients with active or suspected tuberculosis at baseline, evaluated a non-commercial IFN-γ release assay, and had follow-up of less than 1 year. We extracted study details (study design, population investigated, tests used, follow-up period) and the number of individuals observed at baseline who progressed to active tuberculosis and who were treated. We then calculated the pooled risk ratio.

### Quantiferon-TB GOLD Plus performance in children: A narrative review [^116QpASL]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major cause of ill health and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to 2020 statistics, children account for 11% of all TB cases. In 2014, approximately 1.7 billion individuals (almost one quarter of the global population) were estimated to have evidence of immunological sensitization to Mtb [termed Mtb infection or latent TB infection (LTBI)], 56 million of whom are at high risk of developing TB disease. The risk of progression to TB disease (also known as "active TB") from Mtb infection is highest in infants and young children (< 2 years old), falls to a nadir in primary school-age children, and then rises into adolescence. Compared with adults, children (particularly young children) also have a greater risk of severe TB disease, extrapulmonary dissemination (including TB meningitis), and death. Therefore, early detection of Mtb infection and initiation of TB preventive therapy (TPT) are critical to avert the development of TB disease in pediatric populations.

For the detection of Mtb infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the tuberculin skin test (TST) and three interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs): QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus; Qiagen Diagnostics, Hilden, Germany), T-SPOT. TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK), and TB-IGRA (Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Ltd. Beijing, China). However, there is no gold-standard or reference test, and questions remain about the best method for screening children of different age groups. There is substantial variation.

### The diagnostic performance of novel skin-based in-vivo tests for tuberculosis infection compared with purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests and blood-based in vitro interferon-γ release assays: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iYVDb]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Novel skin-based tests for tuberculosis infection might present suitable alternatives to traditional tests; however, the diagnostic performance of these new tests compared with the purified protein derivative-tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) needs systematic assessment.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched English (Medline OVID), Chinese (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Russian (e-library) databases from the inception of each database to May 15, 2019. We conducted an updated search of the Russian and English databases on October 20, 2020, using terms "ESAT6" OR "CFP10" AND "skin test" AND "tuberculosis" OR "C-Tb" OR "Diaskintest". We included studies reporting on the performance of index tests alone or compared with a comparator. Inclusion criteria varied according to review objectives and performance outcome, but reporting of test cut-offs for positivity applied to the study population was required from all studies. We used a hierarchy of reference standards for tuberculosis infection consistent with the 2020 WHO framework to evaluate diagnostic performance. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts for English and Chinese (LF and MK) and Russian studies (MK and VN). Study quality was assessed with QUADAS-2. Pooled random-effects estimates are presented when appropriate for total agreement proportion, sensitivity in microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis, and specificity in cohorts with a low risk of tuberculosis infection.

### Comparing QuantiFERON-TB GOLD Plus with other tests to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^1162b4rt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

The fourth-generation QuantiFERON test for tuberculosis infection, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), has replaced the earlier version, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT). A clinical need exists for information about agreement between QFT-Plus and other tests. This study was conducted to assess the agreement of test results for QFT-Plus with those of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT), and the tuberculin skin test (TST). Persons at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and/or progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease were enrolled at the 10 sites of the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium from October 2016 through May 2017; each participant received all four tests. Cohen's kappa (κ) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare the qualitative and quantitative results of QFT-Plus with the other tests.

Test results for 506 participants showed 94% agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT, with 19% positive and 75% negative results. When the tests disagreed, it was most often in the direction of QFT-GIT negative/QFT-Plus positive. QFT-Plus exhibited similar concordance as QFT-GIT with TST (77% and 77%, respectively) and T-SPOT (92% and 91%, respectively). The study demonstrated high agreement between QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus in a direct comparison. Both tests had similar agreement with TST and T-SPOT.

### Sensitivity, specificity, and safety of a novel ESAT6-CFP10 skin test for tuberculosis infection in China: 2 randomized, self-controlled, parallel-group phase 2b trials [^1121zvZF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Diagnostics to identify tuberculosis infection are limited. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of the ESAT6-CFP10 (EC) skin test for tuberculosis infection in Chinese adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted 2 randomized, parallel-group clinical trials in healthy participants and tuberculosis patients. All participants were tested with the T-SPOT.TB test, then received an EC skin test and tuberculin skin test (TST). The diameter of skin indurations and/or redness at injection sites were measured at different time periods. A bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) model was established to assess the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection using an EC skin test.

- **Results**: In total, 777 healthy participants and 96 tuberculosis patients were allocated to receive the EC skin test at 1.0 μg/0.1 mL or 0.5 μg/0.1 mL. The area under the curve was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) for the EC skin test at 1.0 μg/0.1 mL at 24–72 hours. Compared with the T-SPOT.TB test, the EC skin test demonstrated similar sensitivity (87.5, 95% CI, 77.8–97.2 vs. 86.5, 95% CI, 79.5–93.4) and specificity (98.9, 95% CI, 96.0–99.9 vs. 96.1, 95% CI, 93.5–97.8). Among BCG-vaccinated participants, the EC skin test had high consistency with the T-SPOT.TB test (96.3, 95% CI, 92.0–100.0). No serious adverse events related to the EC skin test were observed.

- **Conclusions**: The EC skin test demonstrated both high specificity and sensitivity at a dose of 1.0 μg/0.1 mL, comparable to the T-SPOT.TB test. The diagnostic accuracy of the EC skin test was not impacted by BCG vaccination.

### Ifn-γ release assays in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection among immunocompromised adults [^116Kg6Mf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Immunocompromised individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) face an elevated risk of tuberculosis reactivation compared to the general population. The tuberculin skin test, a traditional method for diagnosing LTBI, demonstrates diminished accuracy in immunocompromised patients. IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) are in vitro blood tests that assess T-cell release of IFN-γ following stimulation with antigens specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

This review evaluates the effectiveness of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB, the two IGRAs currently available, in immunocompromised adults. These populations include individuals infected with HIV, patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, candidates for treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, patients undergoing hemodialysis, solid-organ transplant recipients, and patients with cancer. Based on the available data, IGRAs offer advantages over the tuberculin skin test in particular patient groups and scenarios. Nonetheless, further studies are imperative to more accurately delineate the applicability and efficacy of IGRAs in immunocompromised patients.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^116hn1RC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

We applaud the authors for this important research work, which holds high significance for global TB control. The study was retrospective but reasonably well designed, utilizing stored blood samples from a large prospective cohort study for their training, testing, and validation study cohorts. The study team has also published other promising RNA-based biomarkers and diagnostics to predict incipient TB, which have been validated with cohort data from other TB-endemic areas in the world.

This immune profiling work is innovative because the authors developed and validated a simplified FC method that can accurately detect and differentiate "recent" and "remote" TB infection reactivity as well as incipient TB and active TB. In fact, the ΔHLA-DR MFI assay has a diagnostic performance similar to the best predictive blood-RNA signatures (e.g. AUC of ∼0.75) to predict TB progressors versus non-progressors up to two years.

- **Study limitations**: The study's limitations included bias associated with selecting participants based on sample availability and testing validation in a non-independent study cohort. Additionally, testing methods were not the same in the validation cohort, precluding the determination of diagnostic thresholds for the ΔHLA-DR MFI assay.
- **Additional considerations**: This study also did not include HIV-infected and other immunosuppressed subjects to further determine diagnostic accuracy in this higher-risk group for TB. However, a similar FC assay has shown excellent diagnostic accuracy (AUC of 0.99) in differentiating LTBI from TB in HIV-positive individuals. Importantly, the ΔHLA-DR MFI method has…

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is crucial for TB control, particularly in high-risk populations. Since the development of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), numerous studies have assessed their role in diagnosing active and latent TB. As the evidence base grows, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We reviewed the literature and consulted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations.

The results reveal significant diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four common approaches proposed:

- **Two-step approach**: Tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals) or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals).
- **Either TST or IGRA, but not both**.
- **IGRA and TST together**: To increase sensitivity.
- **IGRA only, replacing the TST**.

Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended. However, most guidelines do not employ objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and they lack disclosure of conflicts of interest. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cAjfU]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Testing people for latent tuberculosis infection and providing effective treatment is critical to the elimination of the disease. Deciding to test for latent infection depends on both the probability of infection and the risk for progression to active disease. As part of the assessment for latent tuberculosis infection, the tuberculin skin test (TST) or commercially available interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; T-SPOT. TB or QuantiFERON-TB (QFT)), or both, are commonly used.

The TST and IGRA rely on an adaptive immune response to tuberculosis antigens. The TST involves an injection of non-specific tuberculosis antigens, which induces a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction that can be measured in infected individuals, whereas IGRAs are blood tests that measure interferon γ produced by lymphocytes in whole blood in the presence of tuberculosis-specific antigens. In the presence of a positive test result for latent infection, treatment depends on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks. These primarily include the benefit of reducing an individual's probability of developing tuberculosis and the risk of treatment-related side effects, which are substantial with treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Equal sensitivity of the new generation QuantiFERON-TB GOLD plus in direct comparison with the previous test version QuantiFERON-TB GOLD IT [^115eRjAd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold IT analyzes interferon-γ release from CD4(+) T cells after stimulation with specific tuberculosis (TB) antigens. Its sensitivity is approximately 80% for active TB. A new test generation (QFTGplus) also analyzes the response of CD8(+) T cells. We investigated both test generations in a direct head-to-head comparison in a German pulmonary hospital. Sensitivity rates for active TB were identical, regardless of whether the diagnosis was bacteriologically confirmed or not.

### Comparison of two interferon-gamma assays and tuberculin skin test for tracing tuberculosis contacts [^116F85zq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) has low specificity. QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) and T-SPOT.TB are based on interferon (IFN)-gamma responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. A novel in-tube format of QFT-G (QFT-GIT) offers logistical advantages.

- **Objective**: To compare TST, QFT-GIT, and T-SPOT.TB in bacillus Calmette-Guérin unvaccinated contacts and correlate results with measures of recent exposure.

- **Methods**: When a supermarket employee with smear-positive tuberculosis had infected most of the close contacts, a contact investigation among more than 20,000 customers was performed. We recruited subjects randomly on the day of TST administration (n = 469) and subjects with TST of more than 0 mm on the day of TST reading (n = 316). QFT-GIT and T-SPOT.TB were performed. Demographic data and measures of exposure were collected. TST results were analyzed at a cutoff of 10 or 15 mm. Blood tests were interpreted following the manufacturers' criteria and by varying cutoff levels.

- **Results**: Among 785 study participants, TST results were associated with age, whereas positive IFN-gamma responses were significantly associated with cumulative shopping time, most markedly for QFT-GIT. Among participants with a TST of 15 mm or greater, the sensitivity of QFT-GIT and T-SPOT.TB was 42.2% and 51.3%, respectively. Interassay agreement was 89.6% (kappa = 0.59). By varying cutoff values, agreement between the IFN-gamma assays was optimal at 93.6% (kappa = 0.71) using a cutoff of 0.20 IU/ml for QFT-GIT and 13 spots for T-SPOT.TB.

- **Conclusions**: Blood test results were associated with [text truncates].

### QuantiFERON-TB GOLD Plus performance in children: A narrative review [^116fSZ7B]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The principal role of IGRA, in both adult and pediatric settings, is to identify individuals infected by Mtb who are at risk of progression to TB disease and, therefore, may benefit from TPT. Children with a positive IGRA or TST have a higher likelihood of progressing to TB disease within two years than those with negative results. The second role for IGRAs is to aid in the diagnosis of children with TB disease, which can be challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum samples, the paucibacillary nature of Mtb in specimens, and a lack of disease-specific symptoms.

QFT-Plus was developed to improve Mtb test sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy compared with the previous generation, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) assay. In addition to CD4+ T-cell responses to Mtb, the QFT-Plus detects CD8+ responses, potentially increasing assay sensitivity, especially in young children. However, since the introduction of QFT-Plus in children, no reviews have evaluated QFT-Plus performance specifically in the pediatric population. Therefore, in this narrative review, we identified and summarized recent studies evaluating the performance of the QFT-Plus IGRA as a test for Mtb infection and TB disease in children. The performance of this test in adults was reviewed previously.

### Evaluating latent tuberculosis infection diagnostics using latent class analysis [^114L6nAw]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

Lack of a gold standard for latent TB infection has precluded direct measurement of test characteristics for the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays, namely QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB.

- **Objective**: We estimated test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence in a prospective, US-based cohort of 10,740 participants at high risk for latent infection.

- **Methods**: Bayesian latent class analysis was employed to estimate test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence among subgroups based on age, foreign birth outside the United States, and HIV infection.

- **Results**: Latent TB infection prevalence varied from 4.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged < 5 years to 34.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years. Test sensitivity ranged from 45.8% for the T-SPOT.TB among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥ 5 years to 80.7% for the tuberculin skin test among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years. The skin test was less specific than either interferon-γ release assays, particularly among foreign-born populations; for example, the skin test had 70.0% specificity among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 5 years, versus 98.5% and 99.3% specificity for the QuantiFERON and T-SPOT.TB tests, respectively. The tuberculin skin test's positive predictive value ranged from 10.0% among foreign-born children aged < 5 years to 69.2% among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥ 5 years. Conversely, the positive predictive values of the QuantiFERON (41.4%) and T-SPOT.TB (77.5%) were also low among US-born, HIV-seropositive individuals.

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^111YSzkb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Evidence on the comparative performance of purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for predicting incident active tuberculosis (TB) remains conflicting. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to directly compare the predictive performance for incident TB disease between TST and IGRA to inform policy.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline and Embase from 1 January 2002 to 4 September 2020, and studies that were included in previous systematic reviews. We included prospective longitudinal studies in which participants received both TST and IGRA. Performance was estimated as hazard ratios (HR) for the development of all diagnoses of TB in participants with dichotomized positive test results compared to negative results, using different thresholds of positivity for TST. Secondary analyses included an evaluation of the impact of background TB incidence. We also estimated the sensitivity and specificity for predicting TB. Heterogeneity was explored through pre-defined sub-group analyses (e.g. country-level TB incidence). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. This review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020205667.

- **Findings**: We obtained data from 13 studies out of 40 that were considered eligible (N = 32,034 participants: 36% from countries with TB incidence rate ≥ 100 per 100,000 population). All reported data on TST and QuantiFERON Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT). The point estimate for the TST was highest with higher cut-offs for positivity and particularly when stratified by country-level TB incidence.

### Recent advances in testing for latent TB [^114FyxKQ]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

After more than a century of relying on skin testing for the diagnosis of latent TB infection, clinicians now have access to blood-based diagnostics in the form of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs). These tests are generally associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of latent TB infection. This article reviews the indications for testing and treatment of latent TB infection in the overall context of a TB control program. It describes how IGRAs might be used in specific clinical settings and populations, including people having close contact with an active case of TB, the foreign-born, and health-care workers.

### Comparative results of QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube and QuantiFERON-TB GOLD Plus assays for detection of tuberculosis infection in clinical samples [^111h8td6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay, an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA), was recently introduced as the next version of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay for diagnosing latent tuberculosis (TB). Whereas the QFT-GIT assay uses only one TB tube that induces a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response of CD4+ T cells, the QFT-Plus includes an additional TB antigen 2 tube (TB2) for the CMI response of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, in addition to a TB antigen 1 (TB1) tube for the CMI response of CD4+ T cells only. We compared the results of the QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT assays as routine clinical tests for diagnosing TB, using samples from 220 patients referred for routine IGRA in various clinical departments.

Correlations between IFN-γ levels in the QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus assays were strong and showed good agreement (kappa value = 0.69). Seven cases with positive QFT-GIT assay results and negative QFT-Plus assay results had IFN-γ values near the cutoff value. However, 10 cases with active TB, recent TB, or immune problems showed discordance with positive results only in the TB2 tube in QFT-Plus, unlike the negative results in TB1 and TB tubes. In these cases, IFN-γ levels in the TB2 tube were significantly higher than those in other tubes.

This is the first study to compare these assays as routine IGRAs in the clinical setting. The QFT-Plus assay showed good agreement with the QFT-GIT assay and is presumably advantageous for patients with active TB, recent TB, and specific immune conditions involving CD8+ T-cell responses.

### Comparative performance of tuberculin skin test, QuantiFERON-TB-GOLD In Tube assay, and T-Spot.TB test in contact investigations for tuberculosis [^111XkbRc]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are an alternative or adjunct to the tuberculin skin test (TST) in identifying recent contacts with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but there are scarce data directly comparing the performance of the tests.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the agreement between both IGRAs and to determine which contacts were most likely to represent LTBI, the QuantiFERON-TB-Gold In Tube assay (QFT) and the T-Spot.TB test (T-Spot) were compared in TST-positive persons recently exposed to pulmonary tuberculosis cases.

- **Methods**: Prospectively enrolled close contacts (n = 812) of 123 culture-confirmed tuberculosis source cases underwent IGRA testing using standardized collected data. Factors independently influencing the risk of MTB infection and their interactions with each other were evaluated by multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Five variables were found to significantly predict a positive IGRA test result (age, source case acid-fast bacilli positive and/or coughing, cumulative exposure time, foreign origin). There was excellent agreement between the two IGRAs (93.9%, kappa = 0.85), with QFT finding 30.2% of contacts positive and T-Spot finding 28.7%. Assuming positivity to both IGRAs as true infection, sensitivity of the TST at > 10 mm was 72% and at > 15 mm was 39.7%. The use of either IGRA as a replacement for the TST would decrease the number of LTBI suspects to be investigated by approximately 70%.

- **Conclusions**: IGRAs are a more accurate indicator of the presence of LTBI than the TST. Both QFT and T-Spot.

### Diagnosing latent tuberculosis in high-risk individuals: Rising to the challenge in high-burden areas [^113ZqKSX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A key challenge to greater progress in tuberculosis (TB) control is the reservoir of latent TB infection (LTBI), which represents a huge long-lived reservoir of potential TB disease. In parts of Africa, as many as 50% of 15-year-olds and 77%-89% of adults have evidence of LTBI. A second key challenge to TB control is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated TB epidemic, with Africa alone accounting for one-quarter of the global burden of HIV-associated TB. HIV co-infection promotes both reactivation TB from LTBI and rapidly progressive primary TB following recent exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Preventing active TB and tackling latent infection, in addition to the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course (DOTS) strategy, could improve TB control in high-burden settings, especially where there is a high prevalence of HIV co-infection. Strategies include intensified case finding (ICF), TB infection control, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). Although ART has been widely rolled out, ICF and IPT have not.

- **Factors limiting the rollout**:
	- Limitations of existing tools to accurately diagnose LTBI
	- Challenges in identifying individuals most at risk of progressing to active TB

In this review, we examine these obstacles and consider progress toward the development of new tools to address this pressing global problem.

### Discordance among commercially available diagnostics for latent tuberculosis infection [^113YZ4po]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty regarding how to interpret discordance between tests for latent tuberculosis infection. The objective of this study was to assess discordance between commercially available tests for latent tuberculosis in a low-prevalence population, including the impact of nontuberculous mycobacteria.

This was a cross-sectional comparison study among 2,017 military recruits at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, from April to June 2009. Several tests were performed simultaneously with a risk factor questionnaire, including (1) QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, (2) T-SPOT.TB test, (3) tuberculin skin test, and (4) Battey skin test using purified protein derivative from the Battey bacillus.

In this low-prevalence population, the specificities of the three commercially available diagnostic tests were not significantly different. Of the 88 subjects with a positive test, only 10 (11.4%) were positive to all three tests; 20 (22.7%) were positive to at least two tests. Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination, tuberculosis prevalence in the country of birth, and Battey skin test reaction size were associated with tuberculin skin test-positive, IFN-γ release assay-negative test discordance. Increasing agreement between the three tests was associated with epidemiologic criteria indicating risk of infection and with quantitative test results.

For most positive results, the three tests identified different people, suggesting that in low-prevalence populations, most discordant results are caused by false positives.

### New concepts in understanding latent tuberculosis [^1126hDFk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis, is a prominent global health threat due to the enormous reservoir of subclinical latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Diagnostic approaches are limited in their ability to predict reactivation risk, and LTBI is recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. This review summarizes recent advances in our ability to detect, treat, and model LTBI, as well as our understanding of bacterial physiology during latency.

- **Recent findings**: T-cell subsets and circulating proteins have been identified, which could serve as biomarkers for LTBI or indicators of reactivation risk. In addition, experimental and in-silico models have enabled discoveries regarding bacterial physiology during latency and the host immune response following infection with latent M.tb.

Despite recent advances, much more research is needed to enhance our ability to detect, implement treatment, and model LTBI. This work is crucial for the eradication of this global problem.

### Highly multiplexed proteomic analysis of Quantiferon supernatants to identify biomarkers of latent tuberculosis infection [^117L5Wz5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

A major limitation of the tests (TST and IGRAs) is their inability to predict the development of active TB disease in the future. A positive TST or IGRA result could indicate only a lasting immune response and not necessarily infection with viable bacilli. Evaluating different markers or protein expression profiles like those identified in this study could lead to better tests or algorithms using specific patterns of protein changes that distinguish LTBI from active TB disease and predict progression.

The results of this study need to be confirmed and expanded upon in other studies. If the results are confirmed and found to be reproducible, further studies will be needed that include subjects from different geographic regions, children, patients with immune system suppression (especially patients with HIV infection), and pregnant women.

### Different screening strategies (single or dual) for the diagnosis of suspected latent tuberculosis: a cost effectiveness analysis [^112Eso4J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Previous health economic studies recommend either a dual screening strategy [tuberculin skin test (TST) followed by interferon-gamma-release assay (IGRA)] or a single one [IGRA only] for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), with the former largely based on claims of greater cost-effectiveness. We sought to examine that conclusion through a model that considers the additional costs of adverse drug reactions and directly compares two commercially available versions of the IGRA: Quantiferon-TB-Gold-In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.TB.

- **Methods**: An LTBI screening model aimed at screening contacts was used to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis from a UK healthcare perspective. This incorporated the risk of isoniazid-related hepatotoxicity and post-exposure TB (2 years post-contact) using the TST, QFT-GIT, and T-SPOT.TB IGRAs.

- **Results**: When examining costs alone, the TST/IGRA dual screening strategies (TST/T-SPOT.TB and TST/QFT-GIT; 162,387 pounds and 157,048 pounds per 1000 contacts, respectively) are less expensive than the single strategy counterparts (T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT; 203,983 pounds and 202,921 pounds per 1000 contacts) due to higher IGRA test costs and a greater number of persons undergoing LTBI treatment. However, IGRA alone strategies direct healthcare interventions and costs more accurately to those who are truly infected. Consequently, fewer contacts need to be treated to prevent an active case of TB (T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT; 61.7 and 69.7 contacts) in IGRA alone strategies. IGRA single strategies also prevent more cases of post-exposure TB.

### What does IGRA testing add to the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis? A Bayesian latent class analysis [^115KX67g]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in most countries, including developed nations. With a large number of immigrants in the United Kingdom (UK), TB is disproportionately distributed among new migrants and certain ethnic groups who carry social risk factors and tend to be more adversely affected. In 2013, 7,892 cases of TB were notified in the UK, with an incidence of 12.3 per 100,000. London accounted for the highest proportion of cases in the UK (37.8%, 2,985/7,892), with a rate of 35.5 per 100,000.

A significant proportion of these patients presents with extrapulmonary latent mycobacterium TB. In recent years, there has been an apparent increase in the incidence of ocular TB. This increase may be attributable to a higher rate of diagnosis due to the availability of the interferon gamma release assay test (IGRA). Ocular TB, as a form of latent extrapulmonary TB, faces the multifaceted problem of diagnosis from inconclusive signs and corroborative investigations. It can present as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, vitritis, retinal vasculitis, neuroretinitis, solitary or multiple choroidal tubercles, serpiginous-like choroiditis, subretinal abscess, endophthalmitis, and panophthalmitis.

Ocular TB has been postulated to arise either as a result of direct infection with TB bacilli or as a hypersensitivity reaction to latent TB infection. In-vitro assessment of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) via IGRA has been an important addition to the diagnosis of TB and has increased the sensitivity of detecting the disease.

### T-cell assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Moving the research agenda forward [^11155zLL]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For nearly a century, the tuberculin skin test was the only tool available for the detection of latent tuberculosis infection. A recent breakthrough has been the development of T-cell-based interferon-gamma release assays. Evidence suggests interferon-gamma release assays have higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test, better correlation with surrogate markers of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in low-incidence settings, and less cross-reactivity as a result of BCG vaccination compared with the tuberculin skin test. The body of literature supporting the use of interferon-gamma release assays has rapidly expanded. However, several unresolved and unexplained issues remain. To address these issues, a group of experts met in Geneva, Switzerland, in March 2006 to discuss the research evidence on T-cell-based assays, their clinical usefulness, limitations, and directions for future research, with a specific focus on resource-limited and high HIV prevalence settings. Based on two days of discussions, a comprehensive research agenda was generated, which will propel the field forward by stimulating focused high-impact research and encourage the investment of resources needed to tackle priority research questions, especially in resource-limited settings. Ultimately, if adequately financed, the research findings will inform the appropriate use of novel latent tuberculosis infection diagnostics in global tuberculosis control.

### QuantiFERON-TB GOLD Plus performance in children: A narrative review [^111J1VQS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The WHO's End TB Strategy targets a reduction in incidence to below 10 cases per 100,000 people per year by 2050; however, modeling suggests that reductions of this magnitude will not be possible unless cases of Mtb infection are effectively identified early and treated. WHO targets for preventive TB treatment (30 million for 2018–2022) are also unlikely to be met. Pediatric TB remains neglected for various reasons, including the difficulty of diagnosing pulmonary TB and the belief that children do not contribute significantly to transmission. Given the incidence of pediatric TB and the high risk of progression and severe disease in young children, there is an urgent need to better understand appropriate methods for early detection of Mtb infection to identify those suitable for TPT. IGRAs have value in closing this diagnostic gap.

Evaluation of IGRA performance is limited without a gold standard or reference method. In this review, we summarized the evidence surrounding QFT-Plus in pediatric populations and found this assay has moderate sensitivity of 54.5%–87.3% against a reference standard of microbiologically confirmed TB disease. However, considering the challenging nature of microbiological confirmation of TB disease in children, this should be interpreted with caution.

Agreement between QFT-Plus and TST varied between studies, possibly due to technical and biological reasons, such as subjectivity in TST reading, and TST cross-reactivity to nontuberculous mycobacteria and BCG vaccination. Performing the TST within 2 years of BCG vaccination can result in false-positives.

### A costing framework to compare tuberculosis infection tests [^1161St35]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

While IGRA demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity compared to TST, the latter is generally viewed as less expensive at a population level due to the laboratory infrastructure required for ELISA. A test with lower accuracy might not identify individuals who could benefit from TPT, as it may miss individuals with TB. Paradoxically, TST is often used in low- and middle-income settings burdened with high TB rates and high Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination rates, which not only reduce the risk of TB disease in children but also lessen the accuracy of TST. Should individuals overlooked by TST progress from TBI to active disease, treatment costs would increase, given that TB care is generally costlier than TBI care. On a societal level, relying on TST might prove more expensive than the initial investments required to implement IGRA diagnostic tools. However, few tools exist for TB programs to assess the cost-effectiveness of using TST as the standard-of-care diagnostic in comparison to IGRA.

To our knowledge, most costing studies compare TB diagnostics without considering the opportunity cost — the cost of forgoing benefits of the alternative choice, especially in high-burden, low-income settings. For instance, while TB diagnostic cost analyses assess patients' lost income due to diagnosis, they often overlook societal benefits in the form of reduced transmission. If new tests enhance the accuracy of a diagnostic algorithm, treatment becomes more rapidly available.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116v4Ey4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection, new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease, and the development of novel short-course regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis.

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in ongoing trials. The development of short-course regimens is a major advance in the treatment of latent TB. Regimens such as three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, four months of rifampin, and one month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard nine months of isoniazid.

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that consider new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but two ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

- **Purpose**: To estimate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

- **Data sources**: The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

- **Study selection**: Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-hour) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

- **Data synthesis**: When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in three studies.

### Comparison of tuberculin skin test and new specific blood test in tuberculosis contacts [^116SQ3Ug]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The tuberculin skin test used to detect latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has many drawbacks, and a new diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis (QuantiFERON-TB [QTF-TB]) has recently been introduced. This test measures the production of IFN-gamma in whole blood upon stimulation with purified protein derivative (PPD). The QTF-TB test addresses the operational problems with the tuberculin skin test; however, as the test is based on PPD, it still has low specificity in populations vaccinated with the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.

We have modified the test to include the antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which are not present in BCG vaccine strains or the vast majority of nontuberculous mycobacteria. This test was used to detect infection in contacts during a tuberculosis outbreak at a Danish high school. The majority of the contacts were BCG-unvaccinated, which allowed a direct comparison of the skin test and the novel blood test in individuals whose skin test was not confounded by vaccination. An excellent agreement between the two tests was found (94%, kappa value 0.866), and in contrast to the blood test based on PPD, the novel blood test was not influenced by the vaccination status of the subjects tested.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^113BsXit]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In the United States, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) affects between 10 and 15 million people, of whom 10% may develop active tuberculosis disease. People at increased risk for tuberculosis reactivation include recent immigrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis, children younger than age 5, people who have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the past 2 years, or people with immunosuppression for a variety of reasons. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of LTBI are critical for controlling and eventually eliminating tuberculosis as a public health problem.

Although the tuberculin skin test is the traditional diagnostic measure for LTBI, reduced specificity has promoted the development and utilization of the interferon-γ release assays as an in vitro blood test with specific antigens to M. tuberculosis (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test and the T.SPOT-TB test are commercially available). Despite the rise of the new diagnostic tests, however, there is still no gold standard for diagnosing LTBI, and epidemiologic risks and comorbidities need to be taken into account before initiating therapy. Diagnostic tests combined with recommended treatment regimens are valuable tools that, when used correctly, promise to expedite the elimination of tuberculosis.

### Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin testing for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers in the United States [^114LZGcg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) are alternatives to tuberculin skin testing (TST) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection. Limited data suggest that IGRAs may not perform well for serial testing of healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aims to determine the performance characteristics of IGRAs versus TST for serial testing in HCWs.

A longitudinal study was conducted involving 2,563 HCWs undergoing occupational tuberculosis screening at four healthcare institutions in the United States, where the average tuberculosis case rate ranged from 4 to 9 per 100,000 persons. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT), and TST were performed at baseline and every six months for 18 months between February 2008 and March 2011.

A total of 2,418 HCWs completed baseline testing, resulting in 125 (5.2%) positive by TST, 118 (4.9%) by QFT-GIT, and 144 (6.0%) by T-SPOT. A baseline positive TST with negative IGRAs was associated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination (odds ratio: 25.1 [95% confidence interval: 15.5, 40.5] vs. no BCG). During the study period, test conversion proportions were 138 of 2,263 (6.1%) for QFT-GIT, 177 of 2,137 (8.3%) for T-SPOT, and 21 of 2,293 (0.9%) for TST (P < 0.001 for QFT-GIT vs. TST and for T-SPOT vs. TST; P = 0.005 for QFT-GIT vs. T-SPOT).

Among the QFT-GIT and T-SPOT converters, 81 of 106 (76.4%) and 91 of 118 (77.1%), respectively, were negative upon retesting six months later. Negative/positive discordance was observed for 15 of 170 (8.8%) participants by QFT-GIT and for 19 of 151 (12.6%) by T-SPOT.

### Highly multiplexed proteomic analysis of Quantiferon supernatants to identify biomarkers of latent tuberculosis infection [^112TfQYu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, with an estimated 2 billion people infected worldwide. From this large reservoir, millions of people develop TB disease, and 10.4 million TB incident cases were reported in 2015. Proper and accurate identification and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) can substantially reduce the risk of developing TB and is a major focus of TB control in the United States and in TB programs around the world.

There is no gold standard available for diagnosing LTBI, making it impossible to firmly determine the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect TB infection. Three tests are currently commercially available to diagnose TB infection: two interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs; T-SPOT and QFT-GIT), and the tuberculin skin test (TST). The TST measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the most commonly used purified protein derivative (PPD).

Until the commercial IGRAs were available, the TST was the only test for diagnosing LTBI, despite several well-described limitations. These include the need for two visits, subjective results, low sensitivity for active TB, and false-positive results due to prior BCG vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection. IGRAs were developed to overcome many of these limitations. They require a single blood draw and assess the cell-mediated immune response by measuring IFN-γ produced after incubation with TB-specific antigens.

### Is the QuantiFERON-TB blood assay a good replacement for the tuberculin skin test in tuberculosis screening? A pilot study at Berkshire Medical Center [^115t4DQx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube method (QFT-GIT; Cellestis, Carnegie, Australia) is a recently US Food and Drug Administration-approved interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for the detection of tuberculosis infection, which has been screened for by the tuberculin skin test (TST) for nearly a century. We report a pilot study comparing the QFT-GIT and TST results for screening health care workers (HCWs) at Berkshire Medical Center (BMC; Pittsfield, MA), the second hospital in Massachusetts to use QFT-GIT. For the study, 40 BMC HCWs, 20 TST+ and 20 TST-, were screened with the QFT-GIT test. All 20 TST- subjects were also QFT-GIT-, while only 10 of 20 TST+ subjects were QFT-GIT+.

The overall agreement between the QFT-GIT and TST results was 75% (kappa = 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.268–0.732). The suboptimal agreement was partially due to a higher specificity of QFT-GIT. Confounding factors (e.g. bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination status and birthplace) are discussed, and literature regarding IGRAs and their comparison with TST is reviewed.

### Interferon gamma release assays for latent tuberculosis: What are the sources of variability [^117VkUSC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are blood-based tests intended for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). IGRAs offer logistical advantages and are supposed to provide improved specificity over the tuberculin skin test (TST). However, recent serial testing studies of low-risk individuals have revealed higher false conversion rates with IGRAs than with TST. Reproducibility studies have identified various sources of variability that contribute to nonreproducible results.

- **Sources of variability**: The sources of variability can be broadly classified as preanalytical, analytical, postanalytical, manufacturing, and immunological.

In this minireview, we summarize known sources of variability and their impact on IGRA results. We also provide recommendations on how to minimize sources of IGRA variability.

### Quantiferon-TB GOLD In-Tube improves tuberculosis diagnosis in children [^112qZh4T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of Quantiferon-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) is uncertain in the pediatric population, while the tuberculin skin test (TST) is still conventionally used despite its limitations. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of QFT-IT with TST in a large cohort of children screened for tuberculosis (TB) infection because of contact tracing, suspected TB, arrival from an endemic country, or immunosuppressive therapy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 517 children aged 0–14 years evaluated at the pediatric unit of the S. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy; 366 of them were also tested with TST. Results were analyzed for Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination, country of origin, reason for testing, diagnosis, and age.

- **Results**: The overall agreement between the two tests was 89.9%, but it was highly affected by Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination (P < .0001). According to diagnosis and age, QFT-IT detected latent tuberculous infection cases better than TST in all age groups. Sensitivity for diagnosing active TB in symptomatic children was higher for QFT-IT than TST (93.3% vs. 86.5%), especially in children younger than 2 years, while specificity was high for both tests (99.3% and 98.8%, respectively). A low rate of indeterminate QFT-IT results (3.9%) was not differently distributed among age groups but was associated with a diagnosis of TB exclusion (P < 0.0001), mainly pneumonia (35%), and Italian children (P = 0.0024).

- **Conclusions**: Despite the concern about the use of QFT-IT in children because of their immature

### Evaluation of the effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on QuantiFERON-TB GOLD assay results [^111fCgy9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay for monitoring latent tuberculosis treatment efficacy, the assay was performed serially for healthcare workers receiving isoniazid therapy. After 9 months of isoniazid therapy, all of these healthcare workers remained QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive, and cellular proliferation assays revealed persistently strong purified protein derivative responses. These results do not support the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to monitor therapy.

### Comparison of the Quantiferon-TB GOLD Plus and Quantiferon-TB GOLD In-Tube interferon gamma release assays in patients at risk for tuberculosis and in health care workers [^113W7F2G]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) received FDA clearance in 2017 and will replace the prior version of the assay, the QFT-Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT). Here, we compared performances of the QFT-Plus assay and the QFT-GIT version in a diverse patient population, including patients undergoing evaluation for, or follow-up of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI; n = 39) or active TB infection (n = 3), and in health care workers (HCWs; n = 119) at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). Compared to the QFT-GIT, the QFT-Plus assay showed 91.2% (31/34) positive, 98.4% (124/126) negative, and 96.6% (156/161) overall qualitative agreement among the 161 enrolled subjects, with a Cohen's kappa value of 0.91 (excellent interrater agreement).

Among the 28 patients diagnosed with LTBI at the time of enrollment, the QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus assays agreed in 24 (85.7%) patients. In all four discordant patients, the positivity of the QFT-GIT or QFT-Plus IGRA was associated with low-level interferon gamma (IFN-γ) reactivity, ranging from 0.36 IU/ml to 0.66 IU/ml. Additionally, we document a high degree of correlation between IFN-γ levels in the QFT-GIT TB antigen tube and each of the two QFT-Plus TB antigen tubes, as well as between the QFT-Plus TB1 and TB2 tubes (Pearson's correlation coefficients [R] > 0.95). Overall, we show comparable results between the QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus assays in our study population composed of subjects presenting with a diverse spectrum of TB infections. Our findings suggest that the necessary transition to the QFT-

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionized LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

- **Objectives**: With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis, these include the prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying the risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion, and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting the use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

- **Methodological approach**: Ongoing large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here, we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

- **Conclusions and impact**: Planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of IGRAs in the near future.

### Commercial interferon gamma release assays compared to the tuberculin skin test for diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in childhood contacts in the Gambia [^116fLS9W]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

We compared the performance of the tuberculin skin test (TST), Quantiferon-TB Gold in-tube (QFT-GIT), and T-SPOT.TB in diagnosing latent tuberculosis (LTBI) among childhood TB contacts in a TB endemic setting with high BCG coverage. We evaluated the performance of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and TST when combined in an algorithm.

- **Methods**: Childhood contacts of newly diagnosed TB patients were tested with TST, QFT-GIT, and T-SPOT. The level of exposure in contacts was categorized according to whether they slept in the same room, the same house, or a different house as the index case. For the evaluation of combined test performance, prior estimates for the prevalence of latent TB were used in Bayesian models that assumed conditional dependence between tests.

- **Results**: A total of 285 children were recruited. Overall, 26.5%, 33.0%, and 33.5% were positive for TST, T-SPOT, or QFT-GIT, respectively. All three tests responded to the gradient of sleeping proximity to the index case. Neither TST nor IGRA results were confounded by BCG vaccination. There was moderate agreement (kappa = 0.40–0.68) between all three tests. Combining either IGRA with TST increased sensitivity (by 9.3%-9.6%), especially in contacts in the highest exposure category, but was associated with a loss of specificity (9.9%-11.3%).

- **Conclusion**: IGRAs and TST are similar in their diagnostic performance for LTBI. An approximate 10% sensitivity benefit for using the TST and an IGRA in combination is associated with a slightly greater specificity loss.
