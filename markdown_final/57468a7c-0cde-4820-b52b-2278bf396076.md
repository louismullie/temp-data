## Question

Functional dyspepsia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step expert narrative on functional dyspepsia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining functional dyspepsia and its subtypes using Rome IV. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic approach, including alarm features and when to scope versus test-and-treat. Next, I will review first-line therapies, followed by second-line options and neuromodulators. After that, I need to consider special populations and refractory disease, including dietetics and psychology. Finally, I should confirm what to avoid, clarify the overlap with gastroparesis, and synthesize a practical algorithm with follow-up and audit points.

> Let me first confirm the definition and subtyping so I don't mislabel patients. Functional dyspepsia is a disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness without structural disease on appropriate investigation, typically persisting beyond 8 weeks and often chronic or relapsing, and it is subclassified into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome, with overlap common in practice [^114UTqsE] [^116JFp4f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about endoscopy for everyone. I need to check the initial evaluation strategy. In the absence of alarm symptoms, a positive diagnosis of FD can be made clinically, and most patients with dyspepsia ultimately have FD after appropriate investigation, so routine endoscopy is low yield and costly; instead, use a test-and-treat approach for H. pylori and reserve endoscopy for those with alarm features or selected higher-risk groups, with urgent endoscopy for age 55 or older with weight loss or age over 40 with high gastric cancer risk or family history, and non-urgent endoscopy considered for age 55 or older with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or red flags like raised platelets or persistent nausea/vomiting [^111zg9a8] [^117Exgg5] [^111m1nfz] [^1167n2sM].

> Wait, let me verify the role of H. pylori because I recall older data suggesting limited benefit. Updated meta-analyses show eradication confers a modest but significant reduction in persistent dyspepsia symptoms in H. pylori–positive FD, with an NNT around 12–13, and the effect appears larger when eradication is successful; thus, all patients with dyspepsia should be noninvasively tested and treated if positive, with confirmation of eradication prioritized in those at higher gastric cancer risk [^111BbbVZ] [^115Qvera] [^111zg9a8].

> Next, I should review first-line acid suppression for H. pylori–negative patients or those who remain symptomatic after eradication. PPIs reduce persistent symptoms versus placebo with an NNT around 10, and H2RAs are reasonable alternatives; I need to ensure we use the lowest effective dose and avoid escalating PPIs if there is no response after about 8 weeks, as dose escalation rarely helps and deprescribing should be considered in nonresponders [^112ctZ1k] [^113x293H] [^114HBA8C].

> I will now examine second-line options for PPI nonresponders. Tricyclic antidepressants at low doses, starting around 10 mg nightly and titrating slowly to 30–50 mg, are recommended as first-choice gut–brain neuromodulators with an NNT near 6; I should double-check that SSRIs and SNRIs lack supportive evidence for global FD symptoms, so they are not preferred for this indication, though mirtazapine 15 mg nightly can be considered for early satiation with weight loss and tandospirone 10 mg three times daily is a niche option in specialist settings [^113amFNS] [^116Knxcb] [^116B9EfY] [^112RSrsK] [^1151eNx2].

> But wait, what if symptoms are meal-related and suggest impaired motility. Prokinetics can be considered for persistent PDS-type symptoms after acid suppression, with agents like acotiamide, itopride, mosapride, or tegaserod supported variably by region and availability; I should confirm that routine motility testing is not recommended in typical FD, reserving gastric emptying studies for selected cases with severe nausea/vomiting where gastroparesis is strongly suspected, and remembering that most FD patients have normal or only mildly delayed emptying [^116k6Rjc] [^117Pmdiw] [^116ywCHs].

> Let me consider special populations and refractory disease so I don't miss modifiable drivers. For severe or refractory FD, early involvement of a dietitian helps avoid overly restrictive diets, and a multidisciplinary approach with access to behavioral therapies is advised; I should also screen for disordered eating, including ARFID, when weight loss and food restriction are present, and consider pregabalin 75 mg daily in specialist care for selected patients, while avoiding opioids and surgery given lack of benefit and potential harm [^111ws49P] [^112Nca9F] [^113QAoXA] [^111HFZRm] [^115MRUbE].

> I need to ensure patient education and communication are prioritized because they meaningfully shape outcomes. Establishing a positive diagnosis of FD as a DGBI, explaining the gut–brain axis, triggers like stress and diet, and the chronic fluctuating course reduces anxiety and healthcare utilization; a web-based educational intervention reduced endoscopies without worsening symptoms, reinforcing the value of shared understanding and expectation setting [^113wvRY1] [^116nR6N1] [^114e3gTU].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid so we don't propagate low-value care. Routine gastric emptying testing and 24-hour pH monitoring are not recommended in typical FD, doubling PPI dose is unlikely to help nonresponders, and complementary and alternative medicines should not be routinely recommended due to limited and low-quality evidence, though shared decision-making is reasonable if patients strongly prefer these approaches [^111zg9a8] [^112ctZ1k] [^116FkBo5].

> Let me reconsider the relationship with gastroparesis because misclassification is common. FD and gastroparesis share overlapping symptoms and cannot be reliably distinguished by symptoms alone; delays in gastric emptying, when present in FD, are usually mild, and many experts conceptualize a spectrum rather than discrete entities, so I should avoid anchoring on motility labels and instead tailor therapy to the predominant symptom pattern and response [^11473sMX] [^117Pmdiw] [^116UcLEv].

> Next, I should review a practical treatment algorithm to keep this actionable. Start with H. pylori test-and-treat; if negative or post-eradication symptoms persist, offer 8 weeks of PPI at the lowest effective dose; if inadequate, add a TCA starting low and titrating slowly with a 6–12 month continuation if beneficial; if still symptomatic, consider a prokinetic aligned to PDS features and regional availability; throughout, embed education, dietetic input, and psychological therapies for refractory cases, and escalate to specialist clinics when needed [^113PYskn] [^113tX17o].

> I should double-check follow-up and audit elements to close the loop. Cure is unlikely in FD, so goals are symptom control and quality of life; arrange review at 4–8 weeks after each intervention to assess response and tolerability, and audit H. pylori test-and-treat rates, endoscopy use, and access to dietetic and behavioral services to ensure guideline-concordant care and identify system gaps [^113PYskn] [^116MniRD].

> In summary, I need to ensure a positive, biopsychosocial diagnosis of FD whenever safe, prioritize H. pylori test-and-treat, use PPIs judiciously as first-line acid suppression, deploy TCAs as preferred neuromodulators for refractory symptoms, reserve prokinetics for selected motility-predominant cases, and integrate education, dietetics, and psychology for severe or refractory disease, all while avoiding unnecessary endoscopy, motility testing, and low-value therapies [^116A8fYw] [^117BkEBA] [^111zg9a8].

Functional dyspepsia is a **disorder of gut–brain interaction** [^116A8fYw] characterized by **epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and postprandial fullness** without structural disease [^114UTqsE]. It is common (about 7% in the community) [^111DaEXk] and often chronic, with significant quality-of-life impact [^111fULgg]. Diagnosis is symptom-based using **Rome IV criteria** [^114UTqsE], with endoscopy reserved for alarm features or older adults [^111zg9a8]. Management is stepwise: test-and-treat H. pylori [^113PYskn]; if negative or symptoms persist, use PPIs [^112ctZ1k]; if refractory, add TCAs [^113amFNS] or prokinetics [^113YabJu]; and consider psychological therapies for persistent symptoms [^1111xQXA]. Prognosis is generally favorable, though symptoms may persist or relapse [^116kJKyS].

---

## Definition and clinical features

Functional dyspepsia is defined by **Rome IV** as [^114UTqsE]:

- **Cardinal symptoms**: bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness [^116JFp4f].
- **Duration**: symptoms present for at least 3 months with onset ≥ 6 months prior to diagnosis [^114UTqsE].
- **Exclusion**: no structural disease on upper endoscopy [^116SJaD9].

Two subtypes are recognized: **epigastric pain syndrome (EPS)** — pain or burning not related to meals — and **postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)** — early satiation or fullness after meals [^114UTqsE].

---

## Epidemiology

Functional dyspepsia affects approximately **7% of the general population** [^111DaEXk] and accounts for about 70% of dyspepsia cases [^113XP2W5]. It is more common in women and often coexists with IBS and anxiety/depression [^116kJKyS] [^111fULgg].

---

## Pathophysiology

Functional dyspepsia is **multifactorial**, with several proposed mechanisms:

- **Gastric motility disorders**: delayed emptying, impaired accommodation [^116kJKyS] [^117Pmdiw].
- **Visceral hypersensitivity**: heightened sensitivity to gastric distension [^116kJKyS].
- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: contributes in a subset [^116kJKyS] [^115Qvera].
- **Central nervous system factors**: altered brain–gut signaling, stress, anxiety [^116kJKyS] [^113wvRY1].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

Diagnosis is **symptom-based** using Rome IV [^114UTqsE] and is supported by a negative endoscopy in those with alarm features or older adults [^114jvEuN]. Routine motility testing is not recommended unless gastroparesis is strongly suspected [^117Pmdiw] [^116ywCHs].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise and individualized**:

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Test-and-treat H. pylori | High [^111zg9a8] [^114jvEuN] |
| 2 | Empirical PPI therapy | High [^112ctZ1k] [^113x293H] |
| 3 | Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) | Moderate [^113amFNS] [^116Knxcb] |
| 4 | Prokinetic agents (tegaserod, acotiamide, itopride, mosapride) | Moderate [^116k6Rjc] [^113YabJu] |
| 5 | Psychological therapies (CBT, hypnotherapy) | Moderate [^1111xQXA] [^113PDNtp] |

---

Additional options include mirtazapine for early satiation with weight loss [^112RSrsK] and pregabalin in specialist settings [^111HFZRm]. Opioids and surgery are **not recommended** due to harm and lack of benefit [^115MRUbE].

---

## Prognosis

Functional dyspepsia has a **favorable long-term prognosis**, with low mortality but chronic, fluctuating symptoms that can significantly affect quality of life [^116kJKyS] [^111fULgg]. Persistent symptoms are common, and multidisciplinary care may be needed in refractory cases [^112Nca9F].

---

Functional dyspepsia is a common, chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction [^116A8fYw] with a favorable prognosis; management is stepwise, starting with H. pylori testing and PPIs, then TCAs or prokinetics, and psychological therapies if needed [^117BkEBA].

Introduction

Aims

The previous BSG dyspepsia management guidelines were published in 1996. In the intervening years, an extensive amount of new evidence has emerged, improving understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, investigation, and management of the condition. Importantly, it has been recognised that FD accounts for the majority of cases of dyspepsia seen in clinical practice, and that FD is a DGBI. In addition, the Rome criteria, the gold-standard symptom-based diagnostic criteria for FD, are now in their fourth iteration. Consequently, the primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, was to consider all of these developments and create a new clinical guideline for the management of FD, including the initial diagnostic approach to the patient presenting with dyspepsia. The guideline is intended to be practical to use and to provide an authoritative framework for current, state-of-the-art, evidence-based clinical practice. It has been reviewed by the BSG Clinical Services and Standards Committee and selected reviewers from the BSG Council.

Methodology

A guideline working group was convened. In keeping with the recommendations of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation guideline development protocol, this comprised a diverse multidisciplinary team of clinicians and academics encompassing expertise from primary, secondary and tertiary care, together with liaison psychiatry. The working group also included representation from two patients who reviewed both the initial proposal and the final guideline to ensure implementation of a patient-centred approach.

Each section of the guideline was allocated a lead author responsible for performing a comprehensive literature search. Additionally, the section covering treatment was informed by a systematic review of the literature, the methodology for which is reported within that section. Eligible studies were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Recommendations for each section were made based on the relevant evidence, informed by the literature searches, and were approved by all members of the working group, who met regularly. No formal Delphi voting process was used, but all recommendations achieved complete consensus following extensive review and discussion among the entire working group.

Conflicts of interest

All members of the guideline working group were asked to complete conflicts of interest declarations. These are available as online supplemental table.

Scheduled review

We would suggest these guidelines are reviewed and updated every 5 years.

Conclusions

FD is a complex, multifactorial DGBI, which is highly prevalent in the community, and is one of the conditions most frequently encountered in the gastroenterology outpatient clinic, although the majority of patients are seen and managed in primary care. An effective approach to the diagnosis and management of FD is, therefore, important to healthcare systems, patients and society. This guideline summarises current evidence to provide a practical guide for clinicians seeing patients with the condition, underlining the importance of effective communication, making a positive diagnosis, and reducing unnecessary investigation. It recommends instituting appropriate, evidence-based treatments according to presence of H. pylori, global patient assessment, and patient choice, to address both symptoms and quality of life within a biopsychosocial framework. It has also highlighted emerging new therapeutic options for FD and priority areas for ongoing research.

Introduction

Dyspepsia is a very common gastrointestinal (GI) complaint, with up to one in five individuals affected worldwide. Of those with dyspepsia, around 40% will seek the advice of their primary care physician. Consultation behaviour is influenced, in part, by the frequency and severity of symptoms, and increasing age of the patient. Almost 15% of patients with dyspepsia are referred to secondary care for further investigation and management. The overall costs to the health service associated with managing dyspepsia are considerable, estimated to be over $18 billion per annum in the United States of America (USA). Moreover, when one considers that dyspepsia impacts on physical, mental, and social aspects of health-related quality of life, the true overall costs to society are likely to be far higher, and also encompass loss of economic productivity due to sickness-related absence from work.

Consequently, the scale of the clinical and economic problem guarantees firstly, that there is ongoing interest in the evaluation of novel approaches to the investigation and management of dyspepsia, and, secondly, that there is a need for comprehensive clinical guidelines to assist the physician in providing the best care to patients with dyspepsia; care that is both evidence-based and cost-effective.

This review aims to highlight the most important recent developments in both the investigation and management of dyspepsia, and to explore recommendations from the latest clinical guidelines. The most recent of these were published jointly by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) in 2017. These guidelines include the results of a number of updated meta-analyses that evaluate the efficacy of a range of treatments for dyspepsia. United Kingdom (UK) guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which are also those recommended by United European Gastro-enterology, in lieu of producing their own guidelines, were last updated in 2015. To provide a broader, global, perspective we also consider the Asian Consensus Report on Functional Dyspepsia (ACFD) from 2012, produced jointly by the Asian Neurogastroenterology and Motility Association and the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology. Finally, we summarize the findings of a number of relevant updates to Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews that have been published over the last 2 years.

Presentation of FD, diagnosis and management in primary care

Overview

As previously stated, most patients with dyspepsia will have FD as the underlying cause and, therefore the term 'dyspepsia' in both primary and secondary care is likely to be synonymous with FD. Primary care remains the first point of contact for patients with dyspepsia in most of Europe, and many will be managed only in that setting. Gastrointestinal symptoms account for up to 10% of consultations in primary care, 50% of which are for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as dyspepsia. In the UK, there are one million consultations per day in primary care and, therefore, 50 000 of these are likely to be for dyspepsia or other upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients in primary care often present with undifferentiated symptoms, involving different body systems, and the role of the GP is to formulate a working diagnosis to guide management.

Evolving definitions of dyspepsia over the last 30 years have left both GPs and gastroenterologists confused and, in reality, a specific working diagnosis as to the exact cause of dyspepsia is rarely made. Moreover, FD is still considered a diagnosis of exclusion, via endoscopy, even though 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD after this investigation. In addition, endoscopy is not always readily available in primary care, and GPs may be discouraged from requesting endoscopy because of long-waiting lists and financial implications.

Recommendations

Clinicians should be aware that most patients with dyspepsia will have FD as the underlying cause of their symptoms after investigation (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).

Doctor–patient communication, diagnosis and investigation of functional dyspepsia

Clinicians should be aware that most patients with dyspepsia will have functional dyspepsia (FD) as the underlying cause of their symptoms after investigation (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that, in the absence of upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs, clinicians should diagnose FD in the presence of bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation and/or postprandial fullness of greater than 8 weeks duration (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
Establishing an effective and empathic doctor–patient relationship and a shared understanding is key to the management of FD. This may reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that the diagnosis of FD, its underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the condition, including common symptom triggers, should be explained to the patient. FD should be introduced as a disorder of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), together with a simple account of the gut–brain axis and how this is impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses to symptoms and postinfective changes (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that a full blood count is performed in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia and coeliac serology in all patients with FD and overlapping irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that if no other upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs are reported, urgent endoscopy is only warranted in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with weight loss, or those aged > 40 years from an area at an increased risk of gastric cancer or with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that non-urgent endoscopy is considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that urgent abdominal CT scanning is considered in patients aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude pancreatic cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that all other patients with dyspepsia are offered non-invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori ('test and treat') and, if infected, given eradication therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).
We recommend that successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' is only confirmed in patients with an increased risk of gastric cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that patients without H. pylori infection are offered empirical acid suppression therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).
Referral of patients with FD to gastroenterology in secondary care is appropriate where there is diagnostic doubt, where symptoms are severe, or refractory to first-line treatments, or where the individual patient requests a specialist opinion (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that gastric emptying testing or 24-hour pH monitoring should not be undertaken routinely in patients with typical symptoms of FD (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that, ideally, patients with FD referred to secondary care are managed in a specialist clinic, with access to an interested clinician, dietetic and lifestyle support, with access to efficacious drugs and gut–brain behavioural therapies. Rates of H. pylori 'test and treat' prior to endoscopy, prevalence of H. pylori infection and use of endoscopy should be audited (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).

### Clinicians' management strategies for patients with dyspepsia: a qualitative approach [^115Zeget]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The quality of health care is determined by two main factors: the quality of the judgements and decisions that determine what actions are to be taken, and the quality with which those actions are executed. Within health care, there are wide variations in clinicians' judgements on diagnosis and in the management of patients with the same symptoms and diagnosis. These variations are seen within different disciplines, among both experts and novices. In spite of this evidence, clinicians generally believe that the decisions made by their colleagues would be similar to their own, and hence they assume that there is a broad consensus in medical practice.

Patients with symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract are regularly seen in clinical practice. The symptoms may be either of organic origin – e.g. ulcer disease, oesophagitis, and malignancies in the oesophagus and the ventricle – or of functional origin. Dyspepsia is a collective term and includes conditions in both categories. Dyspepsia is common, and the subjective symptoms in either category varybetween patients. During a 3-month period, about 30% of the adult population suffers from dyspepsia. Among these sufferers, only a minority has ulcer diseases (10%) or reflux (12%). According to the literature, certain management strategies are recommended for some of these conditions, for example reflux. For other conditions, for example functional dyspepsia, the evidence is more ambiguous. One may expect a wider variation in the latter than in the former treatment strategies.

The aim of this study was to describe, using a qualitative approach, the variation in the management strategies and treatments suggested by clinicians in three different disciplines for patients with symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract. According to this aim, the hypotheses that guided our design were:

1. Management strategies and treatments suggested by different clinicians vary considerably, even when optimal treatment is clear cut, as documented by evidence in the literature.

2. Clinicians believe that the management strategies of their colleagues will be similar to their own.

Management of dyspepsia in primary care

The initial approach to the diagnosis and management of dyspepsia in primary care is empirical, based on the knowledge of the patient, their circumstances and the requirement to manage the symptoms. GPs are also aware of the need to avoid overwhelming secondary care services and must balance any requirement for referral with other patient-related factors. The key first step in the initial management is the exclusion of the possibility of upper gastrointestinal cancer, via judicious application of alarm symptoms and signs. However, as mentioned earlier, the performance of these in predicting malignancy as a cause of dyspepsia is modest, perhaps due to the absence of a clear definition of each (eg, the amount of weight that needs to be lost to qualify as an alarm symptom). In addition, as symptoms alone do not discriminate FD from organic conditions, historically, prompt endoscopy was considered mandatory to exclude gastro-oesophageal malignancy in all patients with dyspepsia. However, the yield of this approach to detect cancer is low. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of studies performing endoscopy in individuals with dyspepsia in the community demonstrated that 13% had erosive oesophagitis, 8% peptic ulcer and less than 0.5% gastro-oesophageal malignancy, with the remaining 80% of individuals having a normal endoscopy and, therefore, likely having FD. Given this meta-analysis included several studies conducted over 20 years ago, before the widespread use of H. pylori eradication therapy and PPIs, this suggests that the prevalence of organic pathology at endoscopy is likely to be even lower in the current era. In one study, the cost of diagnosing each case of malignancy in primary care detected via endoscopy was estimated at over US$80 000. For a health service with a finite budget, this is probably prohibitive. Prompt endoscopy might be justified on the basis of providing reassurance to the individual patient that there is no sinister underlying cause for their symptoms, but this effect appears to be relatively short-lived.

Thus, future trials may need to consider a more pragmatic approach, with patients recruited using a less rigid definition of FD, avoidance of the need for endoscopy to 'diagnose' the condition by excluding patients with alarm symptoms or signs, and only the minimum important data collected. More RCTs in primary care, where the bulk of patients with FD are seen and managed, are also required. Placebo-controlled treatment trials may also need to consider a cross-over to, or open-label treatment with, the active drug after follow-up for the primary endpoint has been reached, as has been done in other trials in DGBI, to increase appeal to patients. More head-to-head studies of one drug versus another are also required, similar to the direct comparisons of management strategies for dyspepsia that have taken place in multiple RCTs. A virtual approach to recruitment, already introduced in other DGBI, with remote methodology and no geographical exclusions, may also lead to faster successful recruitment to large pragmatic trials.

### Current management strategies and emerging treatments for functional dyspepsia [^112rWXy9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia refers to painful and nonpainful symptoms that are perceived to arise in the upper digestive tract but are not secondary to organic, systemic or metabolic diseases. The symptoms of this syndrome often overlap with those of GERD and IBS, making its management far from simple. If Helicobacter pylori infection is diagnosed in patients with functional dyspepsia, it should be treated. In patients with mild or intermittent symptoms, reassurance and lifestyle advice might be sufficient; in patients not responding to these measures, or in those with more severe symptoms, drug therapy should be considered. Both PPIs and prokinetics can be used in initial empirical pharmacotherapy based on symptom patterns — a PPI is more likely to be effective in the presence of retrosternal or epigastric burning or epigastric pain, whereas a prokinetic is more effective in dyspepsia with early satiation or postprandial fullness. Although combinations of PPIs and prokinetics might have additive symptomatic effects, single-drug therapy is initially preferable. Antidepressants or referral to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist can be considered in nonresponders and in those whose symptoms have a marked effect on daily functioning. Despite extensive research, functional dyspepsia treatment often remains unsatisfactory. Better characterization of dyspeptic subgroups and understanding of underlying mechanisms will enable treatment advances to be made in the future.

### Clinicians' management strategies for patients with dyspepsia: a qualitative approach [^1118ASNu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract are frequently encountered in clinical practice and may be of either organic or functional origin. For some of these conditions, according to the literature, certain management strategies can be recommended. For other conditions, the evidence is more ambiguous. The hypothesis that guided our study design was twofold: Management strategies and treatments suggested by different clinicians vary considerably, even when optimal treatment is clear-cut, as documented by evidence in the literature. Clinicians believe that the management strategies of their colleagues are similar to their own.

Methods

Simulated case histories of four patients with symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract were presented to 27 Swedish clinicians who were specialists in medical gastroenterology, surgery, and general practice and worked at three hospitals in the southern part of Sweden. The patients' histories contained information on the patient's sex and age and the localisation of the symptoms, but descriptions of subjective symptoms and findings from examinations differed from history to history. Interviews containing open-ended questions were conducted.

Results

For the same patient, the management strategies and treatments suggested by the clinicians varied widely, as did the strategies suggested by clinicians in the same speciality. Variation was more pronounced if the case history noted symptoms but no organic findings than if the case history noted unambiguous findings and symptoms. However, even in cases with a consensus in the scientific literature on treatment, the variations in clinicians' opinion on management were pronounced.

Conclusion

Despite these variations, the clinicians believed that the decisions made by their colleagues would be similar to their own. The overall results of this study indicate that we as researchers must make scientific evidence comprehensible and communicate evidence so that clinicians are able to interpret and implement it in practice. Of particular significance is that scientific evidence leads to an evidence-based care which is effective clinical practice and to the promotion of health from the perspective of the patient, together with cost-effectiveness as a priority.

Based on all the above, we recommend urgent endoscopy only in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with evidence of weight loss. Non-urgent endoscopy can be considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting. In those with aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss urgent CT scanning should be considered. In patients from areas at high risk of gastric cancer, or those with a family history of gastro-oesophageal malignancy, the age limit for endoscopy should be reduced to > 40 years. Recommendations as to when to consider endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia and overlapping gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms are as for patients with dyspepsia alone.

In all other patients with dyspepsia a 'test and treat' strategy should be preferred, with those testing negative receiving a course of empirical acid suppression, using the lowest dose that improves their symptoms. Successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' should only be confirmed in those with an increased risk of gastric cancer, as recommended elsewhere in other guidance. As in any other condition, clinical judgement may still suggest the need for endoscopy in individual cases. Similarly, the patient may insist an endoscopy is performed. In the latter instance, it should be reiterated that the yield is likely to be low and the expected diagnosis is FD, with the patient counselled about the risks and benefits of a potentially unnecessary invasive investigation.

### Clinicians' management strategies for patients with dyspepsia: a qualitative approach [^111Y8pWW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study adds to the present scientific literature by showing that, even in cases with a consensus in the scientific literature on treatment, clinicians can differ in their opinion of which management is optimal. Despite these variations, the clinicians believed that the decisions made by their colleagues would be similar to their own.

Overall, we as researchers must make scientific evidence comprehensible and communicate evidence in such a way that clinicians are easily able to interpret and implement it in practice. Of particular significance is that scientific evidence leads to an evidence-based care, which is effective clinical practice, and to the promotion of health from the perspective of the patient, together with cost-effectiveness as a priority. Cost-effectiveness is a vital concern. Targeting high patient satisfaction may lead to ineffectiveness if the economic consequences of a treatment strategy are ignored.

Recommendations

Referral of patients with FD to gastroenterology in secondary care is appropriate where there is diagnostic doubt, where symptoms are severe, or refractory to first-line treatments, or where the individual patient requests a specialist opinion (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
We recommend that gastric emptying testing or 24-hour pH monitoring should not be undertaken routinely in patients with typical symptoms of FD (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that, ideally, patients with FD referred to secondary care are managed in a specialist clinic, with access to an interested clinician, dietetic and lifestyle support, with access to efficacious drugs and gut–brain behavioural therapies. Rates of H. pylori 'test and treat' prior to endoscopy, prevalence of H. pylori infection, and use of endoscopy should be audited (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1167n2sM]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In summary, dyspepsia continues to be a highly prevalent condition that can influence quality of life profoundly and accounts for major healthcare expenditures. Many different management strategies have been studied in individual randomised controlled trials. This network meta-analysis provides additional support for the so called "test and treat" approach in management. This strategy, recently recommended in national guidelines, was consistently associated with the lowest chance of remaining symptomatic and with the lowest use of endoscopy. Therefore, it is probably of benefit in reducing overall costs, at least in some healthcare delivery models. However, despite the low diagnostic yield of endoscopy in detecting upper gastrointestinal tract malignancy, it might be the strategy most preferred by patients. Management of patients with dyspepsia should continue to be based on best evidence, but should also take into account the nuances of the individual patient within the confines of the healthcare setting.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114MijtQ]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that approximately 20% of patients with dyspepsia will have either peptic ulcer or erosive oesophagitis as the underlying cause, the use of empirical acid suppression therapy as a potential management strategy is a reasonable one, as this is an efficacious treatment for both. There is also evidence to suggest that PPI therapy is an efficacious treatment for FD. Other empirical approaches studied include a symptom-based strategy, based on historical subgrouping of patients with dyspepsia, with those with 'reflux-like' or 'ulcer-like' dyspepsia, who probably had EPS, treated with acid suppression and those with 'dysmotility-like' dyspepsia, now termed PDS, a prokinetic drug.

In an attempt to ration use of endoscopy, another approach that has been examined has been to test for H. pylori and only perform endoscopy in those who test positive, based on the theory that these individuals are more likely to have an organic explanation for their symptoms, a so-called 'test and scope' approach. However, this has not been shown to be any more effective than other management strategies, and has never been adopted formally.

There have been multiple RCTs comparing these various management strategies, including prompt endoscopy, for dyspepsia head-to-head. However, until recently, there was equipoise between some of them, and uncertainty as to which was the optimal first-line approach. Pairwise meta-analyses, and even individual patient data meta-analyses, were unable to resolve this uncertainty completely. Although prompt endoscopy is expensive, it was superior to empirical acid suppression or symptom-based management in terms of effect on symptoms in some RCTs, and was superior to 'test and treat' in an individual patient data meta-analysis, but it was not cost-effective. Another individual patient data meta-analysis of 'test and treat' versus empirical acid suppression demonstrated no difference in either costs or effects between the two strategies. Guidelines to date have, therefore, recommended the use of either first-line, depending on local prevalence of H. pylori infection, because a modelling study suggested that 'test and treat' was unlikely to remain cost-effective below a prevalence of infection of 20%.

### Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and treatment [^115Gaug1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common disorders seen in general practice and by gastroenterologists. New concepts regarding the pathophysiology and its role for the symptom pattern have emerged during the last few years. This is of importance for development of new treatment alternatives in the near future. At the moment, however, empirical treatment with acid-suppressive agents and prokinetics is the recommended therapeutic approach in the management of these patients, despite limited efficacy. Identification and treatment of H pylori infection has been recommended for uninvestigated dyspepsia, because it may cure underlying peptic ulcer disease, but is unlikely to provide symptomatic benefit to patients with functional dyspepsia. Refractory patients may respond to antidepressants or to psychologic treatments, but proof of efficacy is limited. New and more effective approaches are badly needed for functional dyspepsia.

Communicating a diagnosis and management plan

It is important to build rapport and trust in the doctor–patient relationship by adopting the principles of empathic listening to optimise the consultation. The clinician should appear confident and, after the clinical assessment is complete, communicate a positive diagnosis of FD based on presence of typical symptoms. This needs to be done using simple words and explanations. It should be explained that FD is a chronic disorder, with recurrent fluctuating symptoms triggered by some of the factors mentioned above, but is not associated with an increased risk of cancer or mortality.FD should be explained as a DGBI that can be impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioural, or emotional responses to symptoms, and postinfection changes. This aims to assist the patient in understanding and accepting the diagnosis and engaging with a shared management plan. It is particularly important to explain the mechanisms of action, potential side effects and rationale for the use of dietary modifications, drugs, or behavioural treatments within the context of the gut–brain axis. This approach is supported by a recent RCT conducted in patients with dyspepsia without alarm symptoms comparing a self-managed web-based educational intervention vs prompt endoscopy. This demonstrated that the web-based educational intervention, which explained normal gastric function, the natural history of dyspepsia, and the role and limited added value of endoscopy in its management, significantly decreased the number of endoscopies required to manage the condition and was associated with similar improvements in symptoms and quality of life, compared with prompt endoscopy.

Recommendations

Establishing an effective and empathic doctor–patient relationship and a shared understanding is key to the management of FD. This may reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).
We recommend that the diagnosis of FD, its underlying pathophysiology, and the natural history of the condition, including common symptom triggers, should be explained to the patient. FD should be introduced as a DGBI, together with a simple account of the gut–brain axis and how this is impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional responses to symptoms, and postinfective changes (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: very low).

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116ZwbCe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a very common gastrointestinal (GI) condition worldwide. We critically examine the recommendations of recently published guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, including those produced jointly by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology, and those published by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Dyspepsia is a symptom complex, characterized by a range of upper GI symptoms including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and post-prandial fullness. Although alarm features are used to help prioritize access to upper GI endoscopy, they are of limited utility in predicting endoscopic findings, and the majority of patients with dyspepsia will have no organic pathology identified at upper GI endoscopy. These patients are labelled as having functional dyspepsia (FD). The Rome IV criteria, which are used to define FD, further subclassify patients with FD as having either epigastric pain syndrome or post-prandial distress syndrome, depending on their predominant symptoms. Unfortunately, the Rome criteria perform poorly at identifying FD without the need for upper GI endoscopy. This has led to the investigation of alternative diagnostic approaches, including whether a capsaicin pill or combined serum biomarkers can accurately identify patients with FD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support either of these approaches at the present time. Patients with FD should be tested for H. pylori infection and be prescribed eradication therapy if they test positive. If they continue to have symptoms following this, then a trial of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be given for up to 8 weeks. In cases where symptoms fail to adequately respond to PPI treatment, a tricyclic antidepressant may be of benefit, and should be continued for 6 to 12 months in patients who respond. Prokinetics demonstrate limited efficacy for treating FD, but could be considered if other strategies have failed. However, there are practical difficulties due to their limited availability in some countries and the risk of serious side effects. Patients with FD who fail to respond to drug treatments should be offered psychological therapy, where available. Overall, with the exception of recommendations relating to H. pylori testing and the prescription of PPIs, which are made on the basis of high-quality evidence, the evidence underpinning other elements of dyspepsia management is largely of low-quality. Consequently, there are still many aspects of the evaluation and management of dyspepsia that require further research.

### Clinical practice: diagnosis and evaluation of dyspepsia [^115m7ABM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The main issue regarding the approach to the patient with uninvestigated dyspepsia is whether the symptoms are the result of an important clinical illness, which then determines the appropriate management strategy for the treatment of the symptoms. An initial trial of empiric antisecretory drugs is recommended for those without Helicobacter pylori infection and no alarm symptoms, whereas H. pylori eradication is recommended for those with an active H. pylori infection. Treatment expectations for H. pylori infections should theoretically be similar to other common infectious diseases. In most regions, clarithromycin resistance has undermined traditional triple therapy so that it is no longer a suitable choice as an empiric therapy. Four drug therapies, such as sequential, concomitant, and bismuth-quadruple therapy are generally still acceptable choices as empiric therapies. Posteradication testing is highly recommended to provide early identification of otherwise unrecognized increasing antimicrobial resistance. However, despite the ability to successfully cure H. pylori infections, a symptomatic response can be expected in only a minority of those with dyspepsia not associated with ulcers (so called nonulcer dyspepsia). Overall, from the patients stand point, symptomatic relief is often difficult to achieve and physicians must rely on reassurance along with empiric and individualized care.

Discussion

Methodological and results approaches

The four case histories in this study are representative of patients with conditions frequently seen in medical practice. Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract account for about 6% of all reported consultations in Sweden. Gastritis, dyspepsia, and unspecified diseases in the ventricle and duodenum (patients 1 and 2) are diagnosed in 1.6% of the population; oesophagitis and reflux (patient 3) in 0.9%; and different ulcers (patient 4) in 0.6%.

The clinicians who participated in this study were not representative of a randomised selection of clinicians in Sweden but rather of a select group with a special interest in patients with symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract. Since their experience with these patients was extensive, they should have been able to develop a treatment policy. One would expect a variation in treatment strategy in this group to be more limited than among a randomised selection of clinicians.

The results underpin existing evidence that variations in medical practice exist. This study presents variations both in treatment strategy and in what information is considered important for making treatment decisions. The histories of patients with diffuse symptoms but no objective findings (patients 1 and 2) gave rise to more extensive variations than did the case histories of patients 3 and 4 where the symptoms were more obviously related to a diagnosis (patient 3) or where more obvious organic changes existed (patient 4). Uncertainty in diagnosis could lead to uncertainty regarding which outcome of alternative interventions is optimal. A meta-analysis that evaluates the most effective treatment in patients with functional dyspepsia recommended the eradication of H. pylori if the treatment is to be effective from the patient's perspective, whereas other randomised, double-blind, controlled studies find that eradication has no beneficial effect. These results were underpinned by the variations observed in this study.

### Functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis: are they distinct disorders, a spectrum of diseases or one disease? [^111CrxpP]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) and gastroparesis (GP) are clinically managed as distinct upper gastrointestinal conditions but present with symptoms that are often indistinguishable. FD is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction that negatively impacts quality of life, while GP is considered a rare disease exclusively defined by delayed gastric emptying and symptoms. The degree of overlap between these disorders makes them hard to differentiate in clinical practice, thereby impacting treatment decisions. This review is focused on exploring the similarities and differences between FD and GP to guide clinician management and improve treatment outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was performed and the full texts of eligible articles were retrieved for the extraction of information reported in this review. This summary of evidence supports the hypothesis that GP and FD represent two ends of the same disease spectrum in a major subgroup. Improved understanding of the similarities, differences and overlap is likely to help guide the development of objective biomarkers and better-targeted therapies.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^115GhGa4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression. The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, are unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated. During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy, but may not be cost-effective. Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

### Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and management [^113XP2W5]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is defined as at least one month of epigastric discomfort without evidence of organic disease found during an upper endoscopy, and it accounts for 70% of dyspepsia. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, evaluation for a more serious disease such as an upper gastrointestinal malignancy is warranted. Individual alarm symptoms do not correlate with malignancy for patients younger than 60 years, and endoscopy is not necessarily warranted but should be considered for patients with severe or multiple alarm symptoms. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. For patients 60 years or older, upper endoscopy should be performed. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia; a diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) is suggested. Eight weeks of acid suppression therapy is recommended for patients who test negative for H. pylori, or who continue to have symptoms after H. pylori eradication. If acid suppression does not alleviate symptoms, patients should be treated with tricyclic antidepressants followed by prokinetics and psychological therapy. The routine use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies has not shown evidence of effectiveness and is not recommended.

Presentation and investigation in secondary care

Presentation of dyspepsia to secondary care

Symptoms of dyspepsia are one of the most common reasons for referral to secondary care, with approximately 10% of all patients in a gastroenterology clinic ultimately being diagnosed with FD. Due to unfamiliarity with current diagnostic criteria, the majority of patients are referred without a specific working diagnosis of FD, even though most of the investigations necessary to reach such a diagnosis have often been performed in primary care. Patients are referred to secondary care for consideration of endoscopy, when the GP cannot access this investigation directly, with a request for further investigations where there is diagnostic doubt, or in the case of non-response to treatment. If the necessary investigations have been already performed, a careful clinical history is usually enough to confirm the diagnosis, reassure the patient, demonstrate the commitment of the clinician to help, and offer appropriate treatment.

### Is functional dyspepsia of particular concern in women? A review of gender differences in epidemiology, pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical presentation, and management [^116rKrc7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a remarkably common symptom in the general population. Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by relapsing and remitting symptoms. Treatment strategies should focus on alleviating the most bothersome symptom and can be based on the proposed underlying pathophysiology. The effect of gender on mechanisms of disease, symptom presentation, and treatment response is an area of increasing interest and study. As with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, there appear to be some gender-specific features of functional dyspepsia. Specifically, gender-related differences have been observed in some studies of both the prevalence of individual dyspepsia symptoms, and in gastric emptying and proximal gastric motor function. There also appear to be gender differences in the psychosocial realm, with dyspeptic women experiencing a lesser sense of well-being than dyspeptic men, as well as an association of an abuse history with functional dyspepsia. This review will highlight specific gender differences related to the symptom presentation, pathophysiology, and approach to treatment of functional dyspepsia, while noting where differences have not been found and where further investigation is warranted.

With the exception of predominant heartburn, the management of upper abdominal symptoms not caused by an organic disorder remains a challenge. Systematic reviews of large trials show that suppressing acid secretion and eradicating Helicobacter pylori, prokinetics, and antidepressants have inconsistent effects on the treatment of functional dyspepsia. This inconsistent therapeutic efficacy has been attributed to the heterogeneity of patients, and the contribution of multiple mechanisms to development of symptoms. To achieve greater therapeutic efficacy, it may be necessary to target the therapeutic approach to a specific pathophysiology, such as impaired gastric emptying.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111qXd5F]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dyspepsia is a common condition that could involve a variety of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, but the main symptom is upper abdominal pain or discomfort. At some point in their lives, one in five adults report epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial distress, and other associated upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or nausea. Although dyspepsia is not associated with higher mortality risk, the condition is chronic in many peopleand follows a fluctuating course. Dyspepsia has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life, and is associated with more time off work and lower productivity at work, and greater medical and prescription drug costs each year. The financial implications for society as a whole are huge.

Approximately 40% of people with dyspepsia symptoms will consult a primary care physician. The physician has to make a decision about how best to manage the individual patient. Patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia and alarm features, such as dysphagia, weight loss, or anaemia, or those older than a certain age threshold, require urgent endoscopy. However, the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia in the absence of alarm features represents a classic medical decision making problem because several strategies exist. These strategies include prompt endoscopy for all patients; test for Helicobacter pylori and perform endoscopy in those who test positive ("test and scope"); test for H pylori and eradication treatment in those who test positive ("test and treat"); empirical acid suppression for all patients; or symptom based management according to guideline recommendations or the physician's usual practice.

"Alarm features should not automatically precipitate endoscopy in younger patients but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis". For younger patients, "We recommend patients < 60 years of age have a non-invasive test for Helicobacter pylori and treatment if positive". If negative or unresponsive, "Those that are negative or do not respond to this approach should be given a trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy", and "If these are ineffective tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or prokinetic therapies can be tried". After normal endoscopy, "Patients that have an endoscopy where no pathology is found are defined as having functional dyspepsia (FD)" and "H. pylori eradication should be offered in these patients if they are infected". For persistent symptoms or H. pylori–negative patients, "We recommend PPI, TCA and prokinetic therapy (in that order) in those that fail therapy or are H. pylori negative". Testing is selective: "We do not recommend routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility testing but it may be useful in selected patients".

Treatment of FD

Reassurance is traditionally proposed as the first step in management of FD. Dietary recommendations (eating more frequent, smaller meals and avoiding food that aggravates symptoms) are logical and are usually prescribed to FD patients, but they have not been systematically studied. For many patients drug therapy is considered, but to date the pharmacological options for treating FD are limited. There is a lack of drugs with established efficacy and drug development is hampered by the large placebo effect and the lack of well-validated endpoints for the Rome III definition of FD.

### How to manage the difficult-to-treat dyspeptic patient [^114DjZ4Q]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The main causes of dyspepsia are unexplained gastroduodenal symptoms (i.e. functional dyspepsia), peptic ulcer disease, reflux disease and, rarely, malignancy. A careful clinical evaluation and upper endoscopy will exclude most of the major causes of dyspepsia. The absence of alarm features is reassuring. The yield of other diagnostic tests in this clinical situation is low, and repeat endoscopy is unlikely to be cost-effective. By definition, the difficult-to-treat patient with functional dyspepsia has already had Helicobacter pylori infection excluded or eradicated, has failed to respond to an adequate trial of acid-suppression therapy that used appropriate doses and, therefore, seeks other solutions. It is likely that patients who have failed to respond to previous trials of a PPI will not experience therapeutic gains with high-dose PPI therapy. A major gastroduodenal motor disorder should be suspected if there is severe early satiation (inability to finish a normal-sized meal), postprandial fullness, or persistent nausea and vomiting; here, an assessment of gastric emptying or gastric accommodation can be considered, to tailor therapy. Antidepressants (especially low-dose tricyclic agents) and psychological therapies can be useful. Creation of a logical management plan that includes patient education and support remains key.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^11473sMX]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Although from a scientific and research perspective the Rome IV process may have improved the specificity of diagnostic criteria for FD, the Rome Foundation has recently acknowledged that the restrictive symptom duration required limits the applicability of the Rome IV criteria for FD in routine clinical practice and could, potentially, delay its diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This issue has also been highlighted by global epidemiological studies that have demonstrated a much lower prevalence of FD using the Rome IV criteria, compared with previous iterations. In this context, the Rome Foundation has, therefore, developed less restrictive 'clinical criteria' for use in routine clinical practice. These clinical criteria for FD only require the cardinal symptoms to have been present for 8 weeks, but are otherwise unchanged. There is emerging evidence that the future classification of FD may benefit from incorporating clinical features beyond upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Recent data using latent class analysis have identified discrete patient phenotypes based on the relative extent of coexisting extraintestinal and psychological symptoms. However, the clinical utility of this novel approach requires further validation.

Of particular importance, FD and gastroparesis are symptom-based constructs with significant overlapping features, which cannot be fully distinguished on the basis of either symptoms or gastric emptying studies. The gastroparesis construct may over-emphasise motor deficits to the detriment of a more holistic approach, and so the terms FD with or without delayed gastric emptying may be preferable.

Research: barriers, priorities and implications for future study design

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of FD and its disease mechanisms should lead to improved diagnostic tests to discriminate FD from other disorders with similar or overlapping symptoms for research purposes, rather than merely relying on symptom-based criteria and a negative endoscopy, improved subgrouping of patients and, potentially, identifying new therapeutic targets. The resulting improvement in characterisation of patients may help reduce heterogeneity in both research and clinical practice. However, current biomarkers for FD, such as duodenal eosinophilia, require endoscopy and biopsy, yet the utility of endoscopy in patients with typical symptoms of FD is minimal, which may limit the suitability of this approach.

Current drug treatments for FD are modest in their efficacy, and patients may be dissatisfied with current available medicines and seek out alternatives. The lack of availability of, or safety concerns related to, some efficacious drugs, including most prokinetics in many geographical regions, exacerbates these problems. There are also logistical difficulties in organising large-scale RCTs to test new medicines for FD. Despite this being a highly prevalent condition, trials are not easy to run and patient recruitment may be slow or even inadequate. The latter probably relates to several factors. These include overly rigid eligibility criteria, the theoretical necessity to employ endoscopy to make a diagnosis of FD, and the false belief that gastric emptying studies are required to differentiate between FD and gastroparesis. There may also be a lack of understanding among many GPs and gastroenterologists of the symptoms that constitute FD, as well as confusion with GORD. Moreover, recruitment to RCTs may depend on specialist clinics in secondary and tertiary care, whereas most patients with FD are seen and treated in primary care. Patient-level factors are also important. There may be reluctance to participate in trials if this entails too many visits, invasive procedures, or a high burden of symptom data collection, such as daily diaries. In addition, despite FD being a chronic DGBI with fluctuating symptoms that can significantly impair quality of life, and in contrast to IBS, the role of dietary therapies, some gut–brain neuromodulators, and most gut–brain behavioural therapies has not been explored adequately and remains uncertain.

Evaluation

Diagnosing dyspepsia

Dyspepsia refers to a range of upper GI symptoms, including epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and postprandial fullness. Patients presenting with these symptoms can be broadly thought of as belonging to one of three groups: those with uninvestigated dyspepsia, in whom investigation has yet to be performed in order to reveal the underlying diagnosis, those in whom investigation has revealed a specific organic or structural cause for their symptoms, and those where no organic cause is found and who are deemed to have functional dyspepsia (FD; Figure 1). Organic or structural causes of dyspeptic symptoms include chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and peptic ulcer disease, upper GI cancer, biliary and gallstone disease, and pancreatic disease, including pancreatic cancer. In such cases, patient management is disease-specific. The difficulty lies in identifying which patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia need to undergo further tests, as well as the management of those patients where investigation fails to reveal an underlying organic diagnosis, and who are therefore labelled as having FD.

Classification and diagnostic criteria

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognise that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present, but heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. FD is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic or metabolic disease.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy.FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation, and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) (table 1). Clinically, the EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning that is often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals. It is, however, recognised that patients with FD can have overlapping features of EPS and PDS, particularly in secondary and tertiary care.

Table 1
The Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia

It is important to note how diagnostic criteria for FD have evolved over time. The Rome Foundation has attempted to define the minimum thresholds for frequency and severity of each individual symptom more precisely. For example, in the latest iteration, Rome IV, the term 'bothersome' is used to describe symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Moreover, the Rome IV criteria for FD require PDS symptoms to occur three times per week, and for EPS symptoms to occur at least once per week. However, one of the more contentious issues when using the Rome IV criteria for FD in routine clinical practice is the requirement to have experienced symptoms for the last 3 months, with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

Further, when H. pylori testing or treatment is recommended we do not specify which investigation or which therapy to use.

General overview

It is important to stress that, as with other DGBI, cure of FD is unlikely, and most treatments are of modest efficacy. An explanation of the relapsing and remitting natural history of FD, as well as the fact that treatment is offered with the aim of improving symptoms, social functioning, and quality of life is vital. Although there is little evidence that lifestyle changes lead to symptom improvement, a recent small RCT of aerobic exercise, in addition to conventional management, demonstrated a significant benefit on dyspepsia symptoms, compared with conventional management alone. As recommended above, the first step should be to test the patient for H. pylori infection, because presence of the infection will dictate initial management. If testing has been done previously, and infection was either not present, or was present but FD symptoms have not responded to eradication therapy, treatment should commence with first-line drugs, according to patient choice (figure 2). Second-line drugs are reserved for those whose symptoms do not improve with these measures. All decisions regarding treatment choices should be made by the patient, with advice and support from the clinician.

Figure 2
Treatment algorithm for functional dyspepsia. *Successful eradication of H. pylori should only be confirmed in those with an increased risk of gastric cancer. +Triggers may include spicy food or alcohol, for example, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific dietary therapies, including a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols in FD. †Overall, there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding whether any treatment should be preferred in patients with EPS or PDS. ‡Efficacy of prokinetics varies according to drug class, and many of these drugs are unavailable outside of Asia and the United States. Most trials of acotiamide have been conducted in patients with PDS. §There is no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, used as gut–brain neuromodulators, are an efficacious treatment for FD. ∞Tricyclic antidepressants should be used as a first-choice gut–brain neuromodulator. They can be initiated in primary or secondary care, starting at a dose of 10 mg at night, and titrating slowly (eg, by 10 mg per week) according to response and tolerability. Continue for at least 6–12 months if the patient reports a symptomatic benefit. ⁑Mirtazapine may be useful in patients with FD and early satiation and weight loss.

### Dyspepsia [^116ZHZ4r]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review critically evaluates the current status of dyspepsia and, in particular, recent advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology and management. The very definition of dyspepsia and of functional dyspepsia, in particular, continues to generate controversy; the Rome III redefinition of functional dyspepsia remains to be proven to be of clinical value. Overlap with gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome further complicate clinical definitions.

Recent Findings

Most studies of pathophysiology continue to focus on gastric sensory and motor functions, though some intriguing early data raise the possibility of an infective or immunological contribution. There have been few, if any, major breakthroughs in treatment; most recent studies address instead the niceties of Helicobacter pylori eradication and acid suppressive strategies.

Summary

This continued lack of progress in the area can only lead one to question some very basic concepts in this disorder, such as does functional dyspepsia, as we have come to know it, really exist as a distinct entity?

### United European Gastroenterology (UEG) and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) consensus on functional dyspepsia [^116kJKyS]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common conditions in clinical practice. In spite of its prevalence, FD is associated with major uncertainties in terms of its definition, underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

Methods

A Delphi consensus was initiated with 41 experts from 22 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 87 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus (defined as > 80% agreement) was reached for 36 statements.

Results

The panel agreed with the definition in terms of its cardinal symptoms (early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning), its subdivision into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome, and the presence of accessory symptoms (upper abdominal bloating, nausea, belching), and overlapping conditions. Also, well accepted are the female predominance of FD, its impact on quality of life and health costs, and acute gastrointestinal infections, and anxiety as risk factors. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, the consensus supports a role for impaired gastric accommodation, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric distention, Helicobacter pylori infection, and altered central processing of signals from the gastroduodenal region. There is consensus that endoscopy is mandatory for establishing a firm diagnosis of FD, but that in primary care, patients without alarm symptoms or risk factors can be managed without endoscopy. There is consensus that H. pylori status should be determined in every patient with dyspeptic symptoms and H. pylori positive patients should receive eradication therapy. Also, proton pump inhibitor therapy is considered an effective therapy for FD, but no other treatment approach reached a consensus. The long-term prognosis and life expectancy are favorable.

Conclusions and Inferences

A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis and management of FD.

### Current management of functional dyspepsia: impact of Rome III subdivision [^111VQRbZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a highly prevalent disease characterized by symptoms originating from the gastroduodenal region in the absence of underlying organic disease. The Rome III consensus made a distinction between meal-induced and meal-unrelated symptoms and proposed subdivision of FD into postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome. The applicability of this subdivision and the impact on management are areas of active research. So far, empirical approaches are still employed for the treatment of FD, although various therapeutic modalities for FD have been explored; acid-suppressive, prokinetic, and fundic relaxant drugs, antidepressants and psychological therapies. FD remains a challenge and presents unmet clinical needs.

Gastroparesis can be diagnosed using symptoms, an upper endoscopy not showing mechanical obstruction, and a delay in gastric emptying using a 4-h solid phase gastric-emptying scan, whereas functional dyspepsia is defined by similar symptoms with a normal upper endoscopy. Because most patients (70–80%) with functional dyspepsia have normal gastric emptying and, when present, delay is usually mild (10–20% of material remaining at 4 h), routine motility testing is not required; however, the occasional patient with persistent nausea and vomiting may have a marked delay, and the panel felt that a 4-h solid phase gastric-emptying scan should be performed in functional dyspepsia patients with predominant severe nausea and vomiting who fail empiric therapy.

### Dyspepsia [^111wArcH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A variety of organic diseases can cause dyspepsia, but most patients with epigastric pain have functional dyspepsia. As dyspepsia is common and usually has a benign cause, it is not possible to fully investigate everyone with epigastric pain. Current recommendations suggest that young patients without alarm symptoms can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori test and treat and proton pump inhibitor therapy can be offered to those who are negative or remain symptomatic despite treatment for their H. pylori. Patients who remain symptomatic with this strategy may be investigated with endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia.

Recent Findings

There are a large number of trials for prokinetic therapy in functional dyspepsia, but treatment efficacy is uncertain, as there is evidence of publication bias. There are very limited data for the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants in functional dyspepsia. There has been recent interest in the observation that patients with functional dyspepsia have increased eosinophils in the duodenum and this may be accompanied by other subtle manifestations of upregulated mucosal immunity. It is possible that this is being driven by a dietary substance or by a change in the upper gut microbiome.

Summary

The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but how to manage those who do not respond is a challenge. Future studies evaluating diet and altering the gut microbiome may give clinicians more therapeutic options.

### ACG and CAG clinical guideline: management of dyspepsia [^116mF7oP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

We have updated both the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) guidelines on dyspepsia in a joint ACG/CAG dyspepsia guideline. We suggest that patients ≥ 60 years of age presenting with dyspepsia are investigated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to exclude organic pathology. This is a conditional recommendation and patients at higher risk of malignancy (such as spending their childhood in a high risk gastric cancer country or having a positive family history) could be offered an endoscopy at a younger age. Alarm features should not automatically precipitate endoscopy in younger patients but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis. We recommend patients < 60 years of age have a non-invasive test Helicobacter pylori and treatment if positive. Those that are negative or do not respond to this approach should be given a trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. If these are ineffective tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or prokinetic therapies can be tried. Patients that have an endoscopy where no pathology is found are defined as having functional dyspepsia (FD). H. pylori eradication should be offered in these patients if they are infected. We recommend PPI, TCA and prokinetic therapy (in that order) in those that fail therapy or are H. pylori negative. We do not recommend routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility testing but it may be useful in selected patients.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

Our literature search identified 1381 citations, of which 11 were incorporated into this guideline, and used to update meta-analyses. Agreement between reviewers for study eligibility was excellent (kappa statistic = 0.90). Of these 11 studies, 10 compared H. pylori eradication therapy with a control or placebo, and were used to update a previous pairwise meta-analysis, and one compared pregabalin with placebo, and was used to update both a previous pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis. Recommendations for all other treatments are, therefore, made based on the results of existing pairwise and network meta-analyses.

All data for newly identified RCTs were extracted independently by two investigators on to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Again, we resolved disagreements between investigators by discussion. We extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, with all drop-outs assumed to be treatment failures, wherever trial reporting allowed this. We incorporated data from newly identified trials into existing pairwise and network meta-analyses. As we examined binary outcomes, (global FD symptoms or epigastric pain cured or not cured, or global FD symptoms or epigastric pain improved or not improved), we expressed the impact of each intervention as an RR of global FD symptoms or epigastric pain not being cured or not improving, together with 95% CIs, where if the RR is less than 1 and the 95% CI does not cross 1, there is a significant benefit of the intervention over the control. This approach is the most stable, compared with RR of improvement, or using the OR, for some meta-analyses.

The recent ACG/CAG guideline proposes a more pragmatic clinical definition of dyspepsia; predominant epigastric pain lasting at least 1 month, which may be associated with other upper GI symptoms such as epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting, or heartburn, provided that epigastric pain is the patient's primary concern. However, this definition has not been validated in a clinical study, and it places the emphasis on the presence of epigastric pain, despite the extremely common reporting of postprandial symptoms by patients with dyspepsia.

The role of upper GI endoscopy

Any uncertainty over whether a patient's dyspeptic symptoms have an organic or functional cause can, for the most part, be addressed by undertaking upper GI endoscopy, although in the case of suspected biliary or pancreatic disease, an abdominal ultrasound scan might also be necessary. However, a previous systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that more than 70% of people will be labelled as having FD following upper GI endoscopy, with < 10% having peptic ulcer disease, and < 1% having upper GI cancer(Figure 3). These low rates of organic pathology do not justify undertaking an upper GI endoscopy in all patients with dyspepsia, even though symptom-based diagnostic criteria alone are insufficient to exclude organic disease. This is supported by the findings of a primary care-based study, which demonstrated that the cost of detecting each case of upper GI malignancy among patients with dyspepsia was > $80,000. Instead, recent guidelines recommend the targeted use of endoscopic investigation in patients with dyspepsia who also report alarm features, including increasing age, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, or dysphagia (Table 1). However, these also perform poorly for predicting endoscopic findings, with limited predictive value for upper GI malignancy, and therefore using alarm features alone to risk-stratify patients and determine who should be referred for urgent endoscopic investigation is problematic.

### Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia [^116HMGkn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen; patients with predominant or frequent (more than once a week) heartburn or acid regurgitation, should be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) until proven otherwise. Dyspeptic patients over 55 yr of age, or those with alarm features should undergo prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). In all other patients, there are two approximately equivalent options: (i) test and treat for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a validated noninvasive test and a trial of acid suppression if eradication is successful but symptoms do not resolve or (ii) an empiric trial of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 4–8 wk. The test-and-treat option is preferable in populations with a moderate to high prevalence of H. pylori infection (≥ 10%); empirical PPI is an initial option in low prevalence situations. If initial acid suppression fails after 2–4 wk, it is reasonable to consider changing drug class or dosing. If the patient fails to respond or relapses rapidly on stopping antisecretory therapy, then the test-and-treat strategy is best applied before consideration of referral for EGD. Prokinetics are not currently recommended as first-line therapy for uninvestigated dyspepsia. EGD is not mandatory in those who remain symptomatic as the yield is low; the decision to endoscope or not must be based on clinical judgement. In patients who do respond to initial therapy, stop treatment after 4–8 wk; if symptoms recur, another course of the same treatment is justified. The management of functional dyspepsia is challenging when initial antisecretory therapy and H. pylori eradication fails. There are very limited data to support the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or psychological treatments in functional dyspepsia.

### Italian guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of functional dyspepsia-joint consensus from the Italian societies of gastroenterology and endoscopy (SIGE), neurogastroenterology and motility (SINGEM), hospital gastroenterologists and endoscopists (AIGO), digestive endoscopy (SIED) and general medicine (SIMG) [^117AqJrn]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most prevalent disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite its broad prevalence, FD diagnosis and treatment are still not well standardized. The aim of this project was to outline an Italian Guideline to define a standardized approach in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic work-up to support both general practitioners and specialists in Gastroenterology. To address this issue, experts from 5 Italian Societies conducted a Delphi consensus process, which included a review of the current literature and voting process on 24 key statements. Recommendations and quality of evidence were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus for each statement was defined as ≥ 80% agreement. DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH: The panel reached consensus on defining FD and its main symptoms and dividing this entity into two different subgroups: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and the post-prandial distress syndrome (PDS). Consensus was reached on defining FD as a diagnosis of exclusion and on the need of performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies to exclude organic causes in patients 45 or older, in presence of alarm symptoms and/or in case of refractoriness to treatment. It was agreed that all patients should be screened for H. pylori infection (by invasive or non-invasive means) and that all HP-positive patients should receive eradication therapy. Routine blood tests were recommended to exclude underlying systemic diseases that could present with dyspeptic symptoms. On the other hand, the panel recommended against the routine use of additional testing, including abdominal ultrasound, celiac disease screening and motility studies in FD patients. TREATMENT APPROACH: Consensus was not reached regarding the dietary regimen to adopt in FD patients. Healthy general lifestyle advice was deemed as reasonable to pursue in FD patients, while the use of exclusion diets was discouraged by the panel. The consensus supports a short course of PPIs at standard dose as a first line treatment in FD patients, regardless of the prevalent symptom pattern, while higher PPI doses should not be pursued as an effective strategy in improving patient's response. Consensus was not reached regarding the routine use of H2RA, antacids and alginate-containing products and/or mucosal protectants in the management of FD. The panel recommended against the use of prokinetics as first line treatment in FD patients and advised on preferentially using a short course of prokinetics in PDS-subtype patients. The panel recommends the use of tricyclic antidepressants to treat EPS and supports the use of mirtazapine for FD patients, particularly for those patients with weight loss, while no sufficient evidence was available to recommend SSRIs. The panel recommends the use of cognitive and behavioral therapy for dyspepsia patients who do not respond to medical therapies. Finally, although the panel recognizes the usefulness of complementary and alternative (CAM) treatments in the management of FD patients, no sufficient evidence was available to recommend its use in FD patients, owing to the poor methodology of most published studies involving CAM.

### Functional dyspepsia: a critical appraisal of the European consensus from a global perspective [^115s54eL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

The European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility's (ESNM) consensus document on functional dyspepsia (FD) has provided a critical review of the evidence for 36 statements highly relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of FD. We provide here our expert opinion on the North American, Australian and Asian assessments of the same topics discussed, and provide evidence where the ESNM consensus may deviate from those in the other continents. New and exciting data about the pathogenesis of FD are emerging including the possible central role of duodenal micro-inflammation (most notably eosinophilic duodenitis and intestinal mast cell disease), but this is a very dynamic field with several gaps remaining in our understanding that are summarized in this review. Identification of non-invasive biomarkers and testing of targeted therapies, including assessing the benefits of multidisciplinary teams in the management of FD, should be future priorities.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^112qtUxp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The ACG/CAG guideline updated a previous Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysiscomparing H. pylori test and treat with prompt upper GI endoscopy for the management of dyspepsia. This pooled data from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 2399 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia. There was no difference in global dyspepsia symptoms between groups [relative risk (RR) of remaining dyspeptic 0.94 (95% CI 0.84–1.04)], but only 25% of patients in the test and treat arms of the trials underwent an upper GI endoscopy over a 12-month period, in contrast with nearly all of the patients in the prompt upper GI endoscopy arms. The test and treat strategy was therefore associated with significant cost savings over endoscopic investigation. In terms of other management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia, analysis of data from four RCTs investigating test and treat versus empirical PPI therapy found no statistically significant difference between these two approaches (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77–1.04). Nonetheless, on the basis of a trend towards test and treat for both cost and clinical benefit from a previous individual patient data meta-analysis, this was the preferred first-line approach, with empirical PPI recommended for H. pylori -negative individuals, or those in whom eradication therapy was not of symptomatic benefit.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^115kGgW7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In FD, a previous systematic review suggested that H. pylori eradication therapy had a small, but statistically significant, effect on dyspepsia symptoms, and was probably cost-effective, but that more research was needed. Accordingly, the ACG/CAG guidelines have updated this systematic review and meta-analysis, evaluating a total of 4896 H. pylori -positive patients with FD from 22 RCTs comparing eradication therapy with placebo. The beneficial effect of H. pylori eradication on the risk of remaining dyspeptic was statistically significant, with a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.94) and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 12.5. In FD, H. pylori -positive patients will, by definition, have no evidence of peptic ulcer disease or malignancy at upper GI endoscopy and the effects of H. pylori eradication therapy are modest. However, as the ACG/CAG guidelines highlight, the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease in the future, with little risk to the patient from treatment, justifies this approach. It is also worth noting that, in contrast to the ACG/CAG guidelines, both the Kyoto and the Maastricht V consensus reports state that H. pylori infection must be excluded, or else successfully eradicated, in anyone complaining of dyspeptic symptoms before a diagnosis of FD can be made. This recommendation is based on the observation that H. pylori infection is associated with chronic active gastritis to a varying extent in all infected individuals, and should therefore be considered as an organic disease. However, it must be emphasized that, at the present time, it is not universally agreed that dyspepsia can only be classified as being 'functional' when H. pylori infection is absent.

Abnormal gastric accommodation has been identified in up to 40% of patients with functional dyspepsia, and delayed gastric emptying has been identified in up to 30% (usually mild); in a recent large multicenter trial using a validated 4-h solid phase gastric-emptying scan protocol with all studies read at one center, 21% of patients meeting Rome III criteria for functional dyspepsia had delayed gastric emptying. Because tests to measure gastric accommodation are not readily available or are expensive, invasive and uncomfortable, and because delays in gastric emptying are not accurately related to symptoms, routine motility tests for patients with functional dyspepsia are not recommended.

Conclusions – Practical management

In FD patients with mild symptoms reassurance and some dietary recommendations may be sufficient. In patients with severe symptoms or in those who do not respond to lifestyle measures, drug therapy is considered. Before drug administration, testing for H. pylori and eradication treatment, if positive, should be proposed, but the yield in terms of symptom relief will be low. Both PPIs and prokinetics have been used as first line treatment, but Rome III subdivision of FD may determine the most suitable choice for each subgroup. Thus, in patients with EPS a 4–8 week trial of PPI therapy is the treatment of choice, whereas in patients with PDS a prokinetic drug should probably be proposed as initial therapy. In cases of insufficient therapeutic response combined therapy or a change of drug class is advisable, or combination therapy can be considered. In patients who remain refractory to initial therapy, a trial of a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant may be considered. Serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors should probably be avoided. In patients motivated for psychological therapies, hypnotherapy can be an interesting option although data are limited.

Purpose Of Review

Structural causes are absent in more than 50% of patients with symptoms referred to the gastroduodenal region when routine diagnostic tests are applied. New knowledge holds the prospect that targeted therapy may more optimally manage subsets of these patients with functional dyspepsia.

Recent Findings

An understanding of gut-to-brain and brain-to-gut pathways in functional dyspepsia is expanding. Minimal mucosal inflammation with eosinophils (and in some cases mast cells) characterized by ultrastructural changes in the duodenum appears to be present in a substantial subgroup of functional dyspepsia patients as identified now by investigators globally. Although antibiotic therapy targeting Helicobacter pylori appears to be effective in a small proportion of functional dyspepsia patients, eradication therapy may be more effective in functional dyspepsia patients with microscopic duodenal inflammation, a potentially important finding needing to be confirmed. This may suggest that the effects of antibiotics for functional dyspepsia are not simply mediated by the eradication of gastric H. pylori, but have other antibacterial effects (e.g., on the duodenal microbiome). Abnormal visceral sensory function plays a key role not only in the manifestations of functional dyspepsia but also in peptic ulcer disease.

Summary

The pathophysiologic concepts underlying functional dyspepsia and related treatment approaches are shifting from a focus on H. pylori, acid suppression or modulation of motility toward new models. New evidence suggests that minimal duodenal inflammation plays a role in symptom generation in at least a proportion of patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms. This is a paradigm shift and ultimately may change the treatment of many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

H. pylori eradication therapy

Given that 5% of dyspepsia in the community is attributable to H. pylori, and up to 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have FD, eradicating the bacterium in patients diagnosed with FD who are found to be H. pylori -positive is logical. Updating the prior meta-analysis of H. pylori eradication therapy for infected patients with FD, with 10 new trials recruiting 2896 patients, demonstrated a significant benefit over a control of antisecretory therapy or prokinetics, with or without placebo antibiotics, or a placebo alone in terms of symptom cure or improvement. The RR of symptoms not being cured or improving in 29 trials, containing 6781 patients, was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92) (online supplemental figure 1), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 64%). The effect was even larger in individuals whose infection was eradicated successfully, compared with those receiving control therapy, in 16 trials containing 2809 patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85) (online supplemental figure 2). When only those trials that reported symptom cure were included in the analysis, most of which assessed this at 12 months, there was still a significant benefit of H. pylori eradication therapy (RR of symptoms not being cured = 0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94) (online supplemental figure 3), with low heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 7%). Total numbers of adverse events were only reported by eight RCTs, containing 1937 patients, but were significantly more common with eradication therapy. Individual adverse events were not reported in sufficient detail by the trials to allow further assessment. Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported by 18 trials and were again significantly more likely than with control therapy.

Although the treatment effect is modest, cure of symptoms at 12 months is a stringent endpoint, and it is likely that eradication therapy for H. pylori -positive patients with FD is cost-effective, as it only needs to be taken for 1–2 weeks. In terms of which patients are more likely to respond, one trial demonstrated a significant effect of eradication therapy on epigastric pain and burning, but not early satiation or postprandial fullness, suggesting the benefit may be more pronounced in EPS.

Recommendations

Eradication therapy is an efficacious treatment for H. pylori -positive patients with FD. Adverse events are more common than with a control therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).

### Functional dyspepsia: evaluation and management… [^113PDNtp]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The American College of Gastroenterology and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology broadly define functional dyspepsia as at least one month of epigastric discomfort without evidence of organic disease on endoscopy. 2 The more detailed Rome IV diagnostic criteria define functional dyspepsia as one to three days per week of symptoms of postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning without evidence of structural disease. A cross-sectional study using the Rome IV criteria estimated the prevalence of functional dyspepsia to be 12% in the United States and was the most common cause of dyspepsia.

1. WHAT'S NEW ON THIS TOPIC Functional Dyspepsia A cross-sectional study using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia estimated the prevalence to be 12% in the United States, making it the most common cause of dyspepsia.

A systematic review of 15 observational studies and one randomized controlled trial found that foods high in fat, wheat, FODMAPs, and naturally occurring food chemicals, such as caffeine, were associated with symptoms of functional dyspepsia. Pathophysiology The causes of functional dyspepsia are multifactorial. 5 Helicobacter pylori infection and acid secretion may play a role because H. pylori eradication and acid suppression improve symptoms of dyspepsia. 2 Abnormal gastric or duodenal motility and impaired gastric myoelectrical activity are present in 70% to 80% of patients with functional dyspepsia accompanied by postprandial pain or discomfort. NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY A review of 12 RCTs of patients with functional dyspepsia found a statistically significant benefit of psychological therapy over the control group.

2 Psychotherapy should not be used as a first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia because of the low quality of the data, the high risk of bias attributed to the lack of blinded psychological interventions, and subjective symptom scoring. It is reasonable to consider psychological therapy if drug therapy has been ineffective.

The pressure also limits her ability to exercise. Sometimes, Mrs. C. will eat certain foods that later make her feel sick; however, the next day she will eat the same foods and feel fine. The symptoms do not improve with heartburn medication or any of the other medications she is taking. Evaluation initially included a normal physical examination, with the exception of mild epigastric tenderness to palpation. Her laboratory tests were normal, except for Helicobacter pylori testing, for which she was treated. Despite treatment, Mrs. C's symptoms persisted. She ultimately had a normal endoscopy, and was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms must be present for at least six months, and must include one of the following: early satiety, epigastric burning, and postprandial fullness. Two variants of functional dyspepsia are postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome.

Functional dyspepsia does not affect mortality, but significantly reduces quality of life. Pathophysiologic mechanisms are believed to include motor function disturbances and heightened visceral sensation. There may be a genetic component contributing to functional dyspepsia, as well as an association with acute gastrointestinal infection and psychogenic factors. Recommendations: The work-up of functional dyspepsia includes a complete blood count to rule out anemia. Other laboratory tests should be targeted to symptoms. H. pylori testing is recommended, whereas endoscopy should be reserved for patients older than 55 years with alarm symptoms, or those who fail medical therapy with H. pylori eradication or antisecretory agents. Treatment of functional dyspepsia is nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic.

Nonpharmacologic approaches include dietary modification, such as limiting dietary fat, avoiding meals too late in the day, and eating smaller meals. Patients should avoid specific foods if they correlate with symptoms. There are few trials on psychological treatment and hypnotherapy, but these can be recommended as adjuncts to conventional treatment.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional… [^113NSCST]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year, and about 10 percent of those affected seek medical care. 1 Most cases in patients who seek care are eventually diagnosed as functional dyspepsia. 2 Functional dyspepsia is defined as the presence of postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. 3, 4. 5 Previous studies have used a variety of definitions for dyspepsia. As a result, further research is needed to better differentiate functional dyspepsia from other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. To facilitate this research, the Rome III diagnostic criteria divide functional dyspepsia into two subcategories: epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome.
3. Several studies implicate gastric dysmotility in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia.

8–12 Many patients experience motility-related symptoms, such as bloating, early satiation, nausea, and vomiting. Studies have documented altered gastric motility in up to 80 percent of patients with functional dyspepsia. 8, 9 However, the degree of dysmotility does not correlate with symptoms. 8–12. Diagnostic Approach Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, physicians should focus on excluding serious or specifically treatable diseases, without spending too much time investigating symptoms. Dyspepsia has a broad and diverse differential diagnosis, including functional dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, reflux esophagitis, and gastric or esophageal malignancy. Functional dyspepsia is the most prevalent diagnosis, making up 70 percent of dyspepsia cases.
15.

PROKINETICS Many patients with functional dyspepsia report predominant symptoms of bloating, early satiation, nausea, and vomiting. As a result, physicians have tried targeting treatment at improving GI motility. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that prokinetic agents are effective in treating functional dyspepsia.
