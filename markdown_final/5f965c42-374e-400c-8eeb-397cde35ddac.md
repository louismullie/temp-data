## Question

A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening abdominal pain that suddenly started 2 hours ago. The patient also has nausea and has vomited twice. She has hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, major depressive disorder, and chronic right knee pain. Current medications include levothyroxine, prednisone, fluoxetine, naproxen, and a chondroitin sulfate supplement. She appears distressed. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a rigid abdomen with rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 13,300/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70 mm/h. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Peritoneal lavage
B. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
C. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
D. Exploratory laparotomy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which is the most appropriate next step in management for a 43-year-old woman with an acute abdomen based on her presentation and chest x-ray findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the problem representation and red flags that mandate operative management. Then, I should verify the immediate preoperative priorities, including fluids, antibiotics, and resuscitation. Next, I will consider what not to do — why imaging or endoscopy is contraindicated in frank peritonitis. After that, I need to review the differential and how SLE modifies pretest probabilities, including mesenteric ischemia and perforation. Finally, I will synthesize the management recommendation and briefly note postoperative diagnostic steps and immunomodulatory considerations [^1149qknL] [^11361VUE] [^112NC3Rb] [^112ARMhy] [^116P4roe].

> Let me first confirm the problem representation: a 43-year-old woman with 2 hours of sudden severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, a rigid abdomen with rebound, hypoactive bowel sounds, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis — this constellation signals generalized peritonitis and mandates emergent surgical exploration rather than further diagnostic delays or nonoperative management [^112NC3Rb] [^1135xHQE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that these are truly peritoneal signs. Rigidity and rebound tenderness reflect parietal peritoneal irritation and are highly specific markers of serious intra-abdominal pathology that often require operative management, whereas isolated tenderness without peritoneal signs is less specific and may be managed nonoperatively in select contexts [^111wABHK] [^112bHDkA].

> I need to check immediate preoperative priorities before going to the operating room. The next steps are large-bore IV access, aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation (approximately 20 mL/kg boluses titrated to perfusion), early broad-spectrum IV antibiotics active against enteric gram-negatives and anaerobes, and rapid surgical consultation for urgent exploratory laparotomy; delaying source control in frank peritonitis worsens outcomes and is unacceptable [^11361VUE] [^112NC3Rb] [^112ARMhy].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging here. With overt peritoneal signs and a rigid abdomen, further imaging (CT, ultrasound, or chest x-ray) is contraindicated because it will not change immediate management and will only delay life-saving surgery; definitive diagnosis and source control are achieved operatively in this scenario, as supported by surgical guidance for freely perforated diverticulitis and complicated intra-abdominal infections [^1135xHQE] [^111XxLXX].

> Next, I should review the differential, but I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely. While acute appendicitis is common, the sudden onset, diffuse peritoneal signs, and early presentation at 2 hours are also compatible with a perforated viscus from other causes (e.g., diverticulitis, peptic ulcer, bowel ischemia/infarction), and in SLE the risk of mesenteric vasculitis and ischemia is increased; the safest, highest-yield approach is operative exploration to identify and treat the source rather than serial observation or nonoperative imaging in the face of peritonitis [^111XxLXX] [^116P4roe] [^1135xHQE].

> I should double-check the impact of SLE on pretest probabilities. SLE increases the risk of mesenteric ischemia and infarction, and CT can demonstrate bowel wall thickening, target sign, mesenteric engorgement, and ascites; however, in frank peritonitis, even if ischemia is suspected, immediate laparotomy remains indicated to assess bowel viability and resect nonviable segments, with endovascular options inappropriate once transmural necrosis and peritonitis are present [^116P4roe] [^111XxLXX].

> But wait, what if I consider EGD or ERCP for suspected upper GI sources? I need to ensure I do not conflate indications. Endoscopy is contraindicated in the setting of suspected perforation and generalized peritonitis because insufflation risks worsening contamination and delays operative source control; these modalities are reserved for stable patients without peritoneal signs or for postoperative/staged interventions, not for an acute abdomen with rigidity and rebound [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the nonoperative options. Antibiotics alone, peritoneal lavage without source control, or watchful waiting are inappropriate when there are clear peritoneal signs indicating a surgical abdomen; operative exploration is the only acceptable next step to identify the cause, control contamination, and manage resection or repair as indicated, particularly in the first few hours of presentation where delay increases morbidity and mortality [^112NC3Rb] [^1135xHQE].

> I should confirm that I have addressed all the answer choices explicitly. Peritoneal lavage (Option A) is obsolete and insufficient for source control in this setting; EGD (Option B) and ERCP (Option C) are contraindicated in frank peritonitis and will delay definitive care; exploratory laparotomy (Option D) is the only appropriate next step, with concurrent resuscitation and antibiotics while preparing for the OR [^112NC3Rb] [^1135xHQE].

> Finally, I will synthesize the recommendation. The most appropriate next step is emergent exploratory laparotomy after initiating IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, with no further diagnostic imaging or endoscopic procedures that would delay operative source control; this aligns with best practices for complicated intra-abdominal infection and acute surgical abdomen with peritoneal signs [^11361VUE] [^112NC3Rb] [^1135xHQE].

> Postoperatively, I need to ensure I do not miss the opportunity to refine the diagnosis. Once stabilized, imaging and endoscopy can be considered as appropriate for source clarification and for SLE-related complications; in patients with SLE and abdominal pain without peritoneal signs, CT can help distinguish mesenteric ischemia, vasculitis, pancreatitis, or other mimics, and management may require coordination with rheumatology for immunomodulation once the surgical emergency is addressed [^116P4roe].

---

The most appropriate next step is **exploratory laparotomy** because the patient has a rigid abdomen with rebound tenderness and hypoactive bowel sounds, indicating peritonitis and likely hollow viscus perforation. Peritoneal lavage, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are not indicated in the setting of acute peritonitis, as they delay definitive surgical management. Immediate surgical exploration is required to identify and repair the perforation, with supportive care including IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics [^112NC3Rb] [^11361VUE].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic implications

The patient presents with:

- **Sudden-onset abdominal pain**: Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain suggests a catastrophic intra-abdominal event, such as perforation of a hollow viscus, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or mesenteric ischemia [^111XxLXX].

- **Rigid abdomen with rebound tenderness**: These are classic signs of peritonitis, indicating inflammation of the peritoneum due to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity [^112ARMhy].

- **Hypoactive bowel sounds**: Suggests paralytic ileus, commonly associated with peritonitis.

- **Leukocytosis and elevated ESR**: These laboratory findings support the presence of an acute inflammatory process.

---

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **perforation of a hollow viscus** (e.g. perforated peptic ulcer, perforated diverticulitis, or perforated appendicitis), leading to generalized peritonitis [^112ARMhy].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While the clinical presentation strongly suggests peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation, the differential diagnosis includes:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Perforated peptic ulcer | Sudden severe abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, free air under diaphragm on X-ray | High |
| Perforated diverticulitis | Lower abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, peritoneal signs | Moderate |
| Perforated appendicitis | Right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis | Moderate |
| Mesenteric ischemia | Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to examination, risk factors (e.g. atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state) | Moderate |
| Ruptured ectopic pregnancy | Lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, positive pregnancy test | Low (unlikely in this scenario) |

---

Given the patient's clinical presentation, **perforation of a hollow viscus with generalized peritonitis** is the most likely diagnosis, necessitating immediate surgical intervention [^112NC3Rb].

---

## Role of imaging studies

Imaging studies play a crucial role in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain. However, in the presence of **overt peritoneal signs (rigidity, rebound tenderness)** and suspected hollow viscus perforation, immediate surgical exploration is indicated without delay for further imaging [^1135xHQE]. Plain abdominal radiography may reveal free air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum), strongly suggesting perforation, but its absence does not exclude perforation. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is highly sensitive and specific for detecting perforation, abscesses, and other intra-abdominal pathologies, but in unstable patients or those with clear peritoneal signs, surgical exploration should not be delayed for CT imaging [^112ARMhy].

---

## Management options

The management options for this patient include:

- **Exploratory laparotomy**: Immediate surgical exploration to identify and repair the perforation, remove necrotic tissue, and thoroughly irrigate the peritoneal cavity [^112NC3Rb].

- **Peritoneal lavage**: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is primarily used in trauma settings and is not indicated in this scenario of overt peritonitis.

- **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)**: Not indicated in the acute setting of suspected perforation and peritonitis, as it delays definitive surgical management.

- **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Not indicated in this clinical scenario, as there is no evidence of biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.

---

## Recommended next step: exploratory laparotomy

Given the patient's clinical presentation — rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness, hypoactive bowel sounds, and suspected hollow viscus perforation — **immediate exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate next step**. This approach allows for definitive diagnosis, repair of the perforation, removal of necrotic tissue, and thorough irrigation of the peritoneal cavity, thereby reducing the risk of ongoing contamination, sepsis, and mortality [^112NC3Rb].

---

## Preoperative and intraoperative considerations

Preoperative stabilization should include intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gastrointestinal flora, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities [^112ARMhy]. Intraoperatively, the surgeon should systematically explore the abdominal cavity, identify the site of perforation, perform primary repair or resection with anastomosis as indicated, and thoroughly irrigate the peritoneal cavity [^112NC3Rb].

---

## Potential complications of delayed surgical intervention

Delaying surgical intervention in this patient would significantly increase the risk of:

- **Sepsis and septic shock**: Due to ongoing contamination of the peritoneal cavity [^112ARMhy].

- **Multi-organ failure**: Resulting from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis.

- **Increased mortality**: Associated with delayed treatment of perforated hollow viscus and peritonitis [^113gEjNX].

---

## Conclusion

The most appropriate next step in the management of this 43-year-old woman with acute abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness, and suspected hollow viscus perforation is **immediate exploratory laparotomy**. This surgical intervention provides definitive diagnosis and treatment, preventing further contamination, sepsis, and mortality. Preoperative stabilization with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential, but surgical exploration should not be delayed [^112NC3Rb].

Case Summary

A healthy 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of sudden-onset severe lower abdominal pain. This is her first episode. She reports nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her last colonoscopy was at age 60, and was normal, except for diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Physical examination is significant for fever, tachycardia, and generalized abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Pertinent laboratory findings include a leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A CT scan is obtained and is consistent with freely perforated diverticulitis, including a thickened sigmoid colon, free fluid in the pelvis, and free air noted near the diaphragm (). The surgeon completes the patient evaluation, recommends initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and plans to go immediately to the operating room for surgical resection.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease. Lymphoma would be the most likely malignancy given her age and constitutional symptoms.

THE EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL AND INITIAL LABORATORIES

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would assist in ruling out other diagnoses, such as urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or renal stones. A pregnancy test is mandatory for women of childbearing age.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

What are the optimal methods in diagnosing IAI that balances benefits and risks?

Statement 2

Early clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosing IAIs. It helps to optimize diagnostic testing and can result in earlier implementation of a proper management plan (Recommendation 1C).

Statement 3

A step-up approach for diagnosis should be used and tailored to the clinical setting, resources, patient's age beginning with clinical and laboratory examination and progressing to imaging examinations (Recommendation 1C).

Diagnosis of complicated IAIs is mainly clinical. Early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications of IAIs.

Patients with IAIs typically present with rapid-onset abdominal pain and signs of local and systemic inflammation (pain, tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and/or tachypnea). Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as oliguria, acute alteration of mental status, and lactic acidosis are indicative of ongoing organ failure.

Physical evaluation may limit the differential diagnosis to direct decisions regarding a proper management plan including the need for appropriate diagnostic testing, the need for initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and whether emergent intervention is required.

The value of physical findings in the diagnostic work-up for IAIs has been studied in relation to acute appendicitis where signs and symptoms are helpful in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis.

The presence of a positive psoas sign, fever, or migratory pain to the right lower quadrant suggests an increased likelihood of appendicitis. Conversely, the presence of vomiting before pain makes appendicitis unlikely.

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been used over the last two decades to complete the clinical assessment of patients with IAIs. Although CT has higher sensitivity and specificity, concerns about radiation exposure have recently prompted reappraisal of the roles of sonography including performance by surgeons.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A pregnant adult patient at 35 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for morbid obesity status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism presented with nausea and diffuse, progressive abdominal pain that started several hours after arrival, with no fever or vomiting reported. She reported good fetal movement without vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid, or contractions. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for rebound tenderness in left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an inflamed, dilated appendix with periappendiceal stranding and edema without fecalith.

Patient 2

A pregnant adult patient at 33 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for inflammatory bowel syndrome, status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic repair of internal hernia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus presented with 2 days of nausea, emesis, and right-sided epigastric pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient denied fever, chills, or cough, and reported regular fetal movement. The patient's presenting vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed focal tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory analysis showed a leukocytosis of 14.3×10 3 /μL. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated appendiceal wall thickening and periappendiceal stranding without fecalith.

### Simultaneous idiopathic segmental infarction of the great omentum and acute appendicitis: a rare association [^113NzvD2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Review

Omental Infarction, the result of impaired perfusion to the greater omentum, is a rare entity. First described by Bush in 1896, the incidence of idiopathic segmental infarction of the greater omentum is estimated to be 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen.

Even though more than 100 cases have been reported in the literature, its association with acute appendicitis has been rarely documented. More interestingly, this case also presented in a female patient, which makes the observation far more uncommon.

The purpose of this report is to describe our first experience with this condition. Even though the etiology is unknown, we highlight some of the possible theories. Analysis of some collective reviews and our experience with this patient indicate that the symptoms, clinical findings, preoperative diagnosis and management of this condition are almost identical, even in children.

A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of right lower abdominal pain of 48 hours of duration along with high fever and nausea without vomiting. The patient had no relevant previous medical history. The pain started at the right paraumbilical and subcostal region, radiating down to the right iliac fossa region.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, no fever, no abdominal distension but a tender abdomen in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No mass was palpable. Results of laboratory studies revealed leucocytocis with a WBC count of 12560/mm 3 and a CRP of 173 mg/L. Both, the plain x-rays and the ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities. No further tests were performed, and the patient was taken to the operating room with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis after appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was administrated.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^112qnQnH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

The first case was a 40-year-old woman who presented with a 2-day history of a vague right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain that was severe on the day of admission. On further inquiry, she reported fever, nausea, and vomiting but no diarrhea. Examination revealed RLQ abdominal tenderness, however, with no guarding or rigidity. Laboratory workup was unremarkable, except for a mild elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 1). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed no evidence of appendicitis but bilateral basal lung consolidations (Figure 1). Thus, COVID-19 suspicion arose and was confirmed subsequently with nasopharyngeal swab testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Consequent to this, a surgical evaluation was not sought further. The patient was treated as COVID-19 pneumonia (hydroxychloroquine, darunavir/cobicistat, and azithromycin). The abdominal symptoms improved on day 10 of the admission. She remained in good health after completing her treatment course until she was discharged 31 days after the first positive COVID-19 PCR. The COVID-19 local management protocol at the time mandated the negativity of two consecutive COVID-19 PCR tests before discharging the patients; this caused the prolonged hospital stay.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1155jpvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical case presentation

An 81-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and a laparotomic appendectomy when she was 12 years old presents to the emergency department with intermittent acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The last defecation was 2 days ago, and the bowel is closed to gas. Current medications only include valsartan 80 mg daily. The body temperature is 37.5 °C, and all vital parameters are normal. The remainder of the examination demonstrates pain and localized peritonism in the lower right quadrant. Laboratory tests are normal except white blood cells at 14,000 per microliter.

Questions include the following: How should this patient be evaluated and treated? What is the working diagnosis? Options include stump appendicitis, right colon diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, right renal colic, right colon cancer, bowel ischemia, or inflammatory bowel disease (Fig. 1).

Comments

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and to characterize the FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect their management), current and recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers). In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate, and psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress. The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding. Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (eg, fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated. Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful and are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings. There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional evaluation. For example, for pain in women that seems to be related to the menses, a gynecologic evaluation should be considered. Similarly, for pain brought on by physical exertion, a cardiology assessment should be sought. If the initial investigations raise concerns or are equivocal, referral for a computerized axial tomography scan might be considered.

Assuming none of the red flag signs/symptoms are present and no abnormalities are identified at the physical examination, laboratory tests, or other investigations, a diagnosis of FACP may be considered if the symptoms are described by the present definition. If the FACP is tightly related to changes in bowel evacuation, IBS is the most probable diagnosis and should be confirmed using the Rome IV criteria.

### Assessment of Alvarado criteria, ultrasound, CRP, and their combination in patients with suspected acute appendicitis: a single centre study [^113gEjNX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of emergency room visits following acute abdominal pain. The lifetime incidence rate of appendicitis is 8.6% among men and 6.7% among women and is much higher in the second decade of life. Appendicitis is an irreversible, progressive disease that eventually leads to intestinal perforation. Appendectomy is the gold standard treatment. Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased mortality compared to AA without perforation. The risk of death from non-gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but this risk increases to 0.6% in gangrenous AA. Furthermore, perforated AA has a higher mortality rate of approximately 5%. Diagnosing AA is often challenging and requires a combination of history, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. The symptoms of appendicitis overlap with several other conditions, especially in the early stages, making the diagnosis challenging. AA diagnostics can be improved and facilitated through clinical scoring systems, including physical exam results and inflammatory markers. Several scoring systems have been created to help in the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis, such as the Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score. These scoring systems use criteria, including common clinical and laboratory findings in patients with AA, to classify them into low, medium, or high-risk groups and can help in a timely diagnosis. However, none of these scoring systems are widely accepted.

The role of diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is another major debate.

In 1986, Alvarado devised a 10-point clinical scoring system to diagnose AA based on symptoms and diagnostic tests in suspected patients, which includes migrating pain (1 score), anorexia (1 score), nausea (1 score), tenderness in the lower right abdominal region (2 scores), rebound (1 score), temperature increase above 37.3 (1 score), leukocytosis above 10,000 (2 scores) and left shift of white blood cells (1 score). Screening and decision-making for patient management were based on the sum of the scores and were categorized as follows. Score 1 to 4 (discharge), score 5 to 6 (admission and follow-up), and score 7 to 10 (surgery).

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3, platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

What would you do?

A 30-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. She had a medical history of severe pulmonary hypertension, bilateral pulmonary emboli, right heart failure, hypothyroidism and systemic hypertension. She was classified as World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III for pulmonary hypertension. Physical examination was remarkable for tenderness to palpation over the right lower quadrant without rebound. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (18.3 k/µL) with left shift (82.5% neutrophils). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for distended fluid-filled appendix, with small appendicoliths and surrounding edema (figure 1). The patient was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care requiring cardiopulmonary evaluation and optimization before possible appendectomy. At the time of transfer, she had developed respiratory distress and was admitted directly to the intensive care unit. A right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was at high risk for right ventricular failure and pulmonary hypertensive crisis. The initial aim was to optimize medical condition of the patient with the hope to avoid operative intervention in this high-risk patient. She was started on sildenafil, intravenous epoprostenol with titration goal of 20 ng/kg/min, heparin infusion and intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam for medical management of acute appendicitis. However, within 24 hours of admission, she developed worsening leukocytosis (20.7 k/µL), fever of 39.1°C, tachypnea and worsening focal peritonitis.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^116oZzjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment results in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions and increases the diagnostic accuracy in these patients; however this approach is expensive with significant use of the resources and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations, averts delays in operative management. Morino et al assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that laparoscopy compared with clinical observation, early laparoscopy did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported higher number of diagnosis and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group. In another study patients who have no evidence of guarding, normal temperature, and normal white cells count were observed; a practice that is proven to reduce the rate of negative appendicectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain (25–35% of all patients), and of those patients only a quarter needs surgical intervention. Clinical scores that were developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful but those score could only be used with clinical judgment, if there is any suspicion of serious pathology the patient should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy.

The current study shows the likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with normal white cell count, no history of vomiting and absent signs of peritoneal irritation with normal heart rate. Patients who fulfill those findings are suitable for early discharge, which may help to reduce the health care cost for those patients. All patients admitted to emergency department with abdominal pain should be referred for surgical opinion and the diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain should only be made after thorough assessment, definite pathology excluded and the patient does not return with the same complaint.

### Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis in a pregnant woman at 35 weeks of gestation: a case report and review of the literature [^111eS7oe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old primigravid woman, at 35 weeks gestation attended our obstetric department complaining of abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting for 3 h. The woman's antenatal care was uneventful. She had no significant medical, surgical or family history and no history suggestive of thromboembolism. She had never used oral contraceptives or any other hormonal therapy.

Upon arrival, she had a temperature of 36.8 °C, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 119/71 mmHg. A physical examination on admission showed a gravid uterus just below the xiphoid process. No abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness were appreciated. The bowel sounds were normal and there were no signs suggestive of peritonitis. A hematologic examination revealed a leukocyte count of 13.1 × 10 9 /L (normal range 4.0 × 10 9 /L - 10.0 × 10 9 /L) with neutrophils accounting for 73.9% (normal range 50–70%), hemoglobin level of 98.6 g/L (normal range 100 g/L - 150 g/L), hematocrit of 0.317 (normal range 0.37–0.43), and platelet count of 187 × 10 9 /L (normal range 100 × 10 9 /L - 300 × 10 9 /L). Coagulation profile and biological tests were within normal limits. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a normal fetus compatible with expected gestational age. The fetal monitor showed that fetal heart rate fluctuated between 150 and 160 beats per min and the uterus contracted occasionally. Threatened preterm labor was initially suspected and magnesium sulfate was given to inhibit uterine contractions. Acute gastritis was also considered.

The second day after admission, the patient complained of more intense abdominal pain that was centered in the right lower quadrant, and she experienced increased vomiting and abdominal distention. Physical examination demonstrated right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound tenderness and a distended abdomen and weak bowel sounds. Hematologic testing revealed leukocytosis with a left shift (leucocyte count of 26.9 × 10 9 /L and neutrophils accounting for 91%) and hemoconcentration (hematocrit of 0.439). Serum amylase was normal. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed dilation and effusion of the right intestinal canals, thickening of the intestinal wall and a small amount of ascites. Abdominal plain radiography was performed and showed no dilated bowel loops and no features of obstruction or pneumoperitoneum. Obstetric ultrasound revealed demise of the fetus.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old G3P2002 with two prior uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and no significant medical history presented at 15 3/7 weeks gestation by last menstrual period. She was brought in by emergency medical services due to a syncopal episode at home. Her history was notable for one-month of progressive abdominal pain and associated nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. She reported having regular follow-up with her obstetrician and multiple recent emergency department visits. She had no prior surgeries. Her vitals showed a heart rate in the 130s and her blood pressure was 76/43. On physical exam her abdomen was diffusely tender with peritoneal signs. Her labs were significant for a leukocytosis to 28,700, hemoglobin of 7.6, creatinine of 1.07 mg/dL and lactate of 5.7 mmol/L. Ultrasonography showed free fluid in the abdomen. Both the obstetrics and trauma surgery teams were immediately consulted as the source of her hemorrhagic shock was unknown. The patient became hemodynamically stable with resuscitation; so, the decision was made to proceed with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.

Concurrently, outside hospital records were made available and reviewed by both teams. They revealed that the patient had ultrasounds performed at 8 5/7, 12 4/7, and 13 0/7. Her ultrasound at 12 4/7 noted a possible arcuate uterus with the pregnancy located more on the patient's right. An additional scan at 13 0/7 reported suboptimal visualization of the pregnancy on both transabdominal scan and transvaginal scan. These records also showed that one week prior to presentation at our facility, the patient had gone to an outside emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. There she had an elevated white blood cell count to 18,000, a transabdominal ultrasound and abdominal MRI. Neither the ultrasound nor the MRI were interpreted as showing any acute abnormalities. Both specifically commented on there being an intrauterine pregnancy. The patient was discharged home from the outside emergency department with a presumed viral illness. A timeline of events is presented in Fig. 1.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1166LKz4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^1169JEG2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical method

Here I am presenting my own method for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis which has been proved to be helpful in many studies around the world. The method relies on a combination of factors derived from physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests. The method uses a simple mnemonics (MANTRELS) that is easy to remember and can be applied in many settings without the need of a computer. This mnemonics makes the method even easier to follow: First you check for the three main symptoms: Migration, Anorexia, and Nausea or vomiting; then you follow with the signs which are: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, Rebound pain (Blumberg sign) and Elevation of the temperature (oral temperature of 37.3 C or more); and finally, you do the lab tests, essentially a CBC to look for Leukocytosis and Shift to the left (increased Stabs or Segmented neutrophils), and a urinalysis to look for acetone as an indication of anorexia if it is not clinically apparent. Rebound pain can be replaced with other indirect signs such as the Rovsing sign and also with the Dunphy's sign (cough test) or the Markle's test (heel-drop jarring test). Another indirect sign that can replace the rebound pain is tenderness by gentle direct percussion with the fist, as a mallet, on the right lumbar area in cases of a retrocecal acute appendicitis. In order of decreasing importance the eight best predicting factors proved to be: Localized tenderness on the right lower quadrant, leukocytosis, migration of pain, shift to the left, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia or acetone in the urine and direct rebound pain. I assigned a value of 2 to each of the two of the more important factors tenderness and leukocytosis), and a value of 1 to each one of the others, for a possible total score of 10. A score of 5 or 6 is compatible with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable appendicitis, and a score of 9 or 10 indicates a very probable appendicitis. To this score the clinician could subtract 2 points if the patient complains of headache because this symptom is very rare in cases of acute appendicitis. In this particular situation the patient may need further investigation to rule out a different disorder. Scores of five or six are in a grey area, and in this case, you may want to observe the patient for a short time (reevaluate every four to six hours) for 12 or 24 h and if the score stays the same consider other tests such as ultrasound or diagnostic laparoscopy. When the score is three or four, the clinician has two options: This could represent a very early stage of an acute appendicitis so the clinician could keep the patient under observation and repeat the tests, or even more, order additional tests such as an US or CT scan if they are available in that particular setting. Another option is to rely on his clinical impression because, as I already mentioned in my original article, "there is always an intangible ingredient in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. If there is any question about the diagnosis, more physical examinations and laboratory tests should be performed and the patient should be evaluated every four or six hours, preferably in the hospital". If the score remains the same or increases after this evaluation, the patient may need surgery. As we can see the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is a dynamic process that go hand to hand with the pathological changes of the disease. As we all know, medicine is a combination of science and art, both of them equally important in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, so we cannot discard one of them in favor of the other. It is for this reason that we cannot depend on the technological advances only but we should use our common sense and clinical experience to arrive to a correct diagnosis.

### Sclerosing mesenteritis successfully treated with a TNF antagonist [^111Kph5W]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old female presented with intermittent nausea, vomiting, fevers, abdominal pain and fatigue. CT scans of the abdomen revealed inflammatory changes within the mesentery and small bowel. Histopathology of the mesentery and omentum showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis, supporting a diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis. Over the past 2 years, the patient suffered debilitating paroxysmal abdominal pain despite treatment with prednisone, azathioprine, sulfasalazine and narcotics. Additionally, she developed sacroiliitis diagnosed clinically and on radiographs. Intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg intravenous) was initiated and continued every 6 weeks for 3 years. The patient has since had a dramatic improvement in her back and abdominal symptoms and has tapered off of prednisone, azathioprine and narcotics. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anaemia, leukocytosis and radiographic findings improved after initiation with infliximab. In conclusion, the authors report successfully treating sclerosing mesenteritis with sacroiliitis by the addition of infliximab. This may implicate a role for tumour necrosis factor α in disease pathogenesis.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia [^111XxLXX]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The classic clinical presentation of AMI is sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain without proportional physical findings such as evidence of peritonitis (e.g. guarding or rebound tenderness). Ischaemia initially affects the mucosa, causing the pain. A high level of suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis at this stage. The eventual development of signs of peritonitis usually indicates irreversible ischaemia with bowel necrosis. Other symptoms at presentation may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea with bloody stool. Septic shock may occur if the diagnosis is delayed. Acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischaemia is also common, notably in hospitalised patients.

The treatment of AMI was surgical until the development of endovascular techniques. Primary endovascular management in all patients with AMI remains controversial due to the lack of strong scientific evidence regarding outcomes and the high risk of death in AMI; however, a meta-analysis concluded that both mortality and bowel resection rates were lower with endovascular techniques than with open surgery favouring an endo-first approach in the absence of bowel necrosis. There is no existing consensus regarding a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm; thus, a multidisciplinary approach is optimal. Selection of a treatment strategy is based on the stage of ischaemic damage, notably the presence of bowel necrosis.

First-line endovascular revascularisation is currently indicated for patients with stable haemodynamics and no CT evidence of transmural necrosis or peritonitis. The main treatment goal is to restore blood flow to the ischaemic segment before transmural necrosis occurs. Ischaemia starts at the mucosa and progressively extends to the serosa, leading to transmural infarction. Irreversible intestinal damage typically occurs within 6 h in cases of complete vascular occlusion. When signs of intestinal necrosis and peritonitis are present, irreversible bowel damage is highly likely and surgery is the first-line treatment. Consequently, these signs should be viewed as contra-indications to endovascular revascularisation alone. Nonetheless, debate continues regarding the optimal management at this stage, as revascularisation is still required and improves the chances of salvaging ischaemic but non-necrotic bowel segments. The main point of contention is the relative timing of revascularisation and bowel resection. The management at this stage varies across centres, reflecting the lack of a consensus.

### Vomiting and apparent life-threatening event [^114NvTJh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a 6-month-old girl who had an apparent life-threatening event after a vomiting episode resulting in activation of emergency medical services for transport to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis for this presentation is broad but easily narrowed down given the additional clinical information. Her resultant diagnosis of intussusception is a common diagnosis but with an uncommon presentation.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

### Spontaneous superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection: an unusual cause of abdominal pain [^115XNARL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a 4-day history of severe, sharp left upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She had been seen 3 days prior at another Emergency Department, and had a negative work-up including a normal non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis for possible kidney stone. Vital signs were: temperature 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse 100 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure 141/80 mm Hg. Physical examination was remarkable for marked tenderness in the left upper and middle quadrants and voluntary guarding. Bowel sounds were normal. Although laboratory studies were normal, a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast suggested a superior mesenteric artery dissection. This was confirmed with arteriography. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of superior mesenteric artery dissection are reviewed.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^115iWwmA]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis. In infants and toddlers, clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel diverticulum, or intussusception. In school-aged children, constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common. In female adolescents, clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion. Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supportive and abortive care during acute episodes recommends placing children in less stimulating environments, replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and energy, and treating symptomatic nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Early intervention within the first 2 to 4 hours of onset either at home or at a hospital may be more effective than later intervention. If these are ineffective, then concomitant sedation is recommended. Severe abdominal pains are treated with parenteral acid suppression and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotics.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions-recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115Efk5L]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Post-polypectomy coagulation syndrome (PPCS) — features and management: PPCS, also called post-polypectomy syndrome or transmural burn syndrome, is thought to occur when cautery injury causes full-thickness thermal injury of the bowel wall with localized serosal inflammation and peritonitis. Typical symptoms and signs include fever, localized abdominal tenderness (often with rebound tenderness), and leukocytosis occurring within a few hours to days of the polypectomy. Patients who are suspected to have severe post-polypectomy syndrome should be closely observed by medical and surgical teams, and receive intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and bowel rest, and most patients recover uneventfully. Abdominal radiographs and computed tomography scans may demonstrate features, such as air in the peritoneum, and carbon dioxide insufflation significantly reduces post-procedural symptoms and pneumoperitoneum associated with perforation at a minimal additional cost.

### Surgical complications of selected gastrointestinal emergencies: pitfalls in management of the acute abdomen [^116QQ82r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Complaints referable to the abdomen are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limited, whereas others are potentially catastrophic. Because serious and benign intra-abdominal conditions share many relatively nonspecific symptoms, it is often difficult to identify patients who have life-threatening problems early in the course of their disease. Apart from relieving the patient's symptoms, the emergency physician's primary role is to detect and stabilize life-threatening conditions in a rapid and cost-effective manner.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting: a case-based approach [^113h3hJS]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

In the absence of acute abdominal pain, significant headache, or recent initiation of certain medications, acute nausea and vomiting is usually the result of self-limited gastrointestinal infections. Nausea and vomiting is also a common adverse effect of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical anesthesia. Other potential diagnoses include endocrine conditions (including pregnancy), central nervous system disorders, psychiatric causes, toxin exposure, metabolic abnormalities, and obstructive or functional gastrointestinal causes. The likely cause of acute nausea and vomiting can usually be determined by history and physical examination. Alarm signs such as dehydration, acidosis caused by an underlying metabolic disorder, or an acute abdomen warrant additional evaluation. Based on the suspected diagnosis, basic laboratory testing may include urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase and lipase levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and stool studies with cultures. Imaging studies include abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Computed tomography of the head should be performed if an acute intracranial process is suspected. Chronic nausea and vomiting is defined by symptoms that persist for at least one month. Patients with risk factors for gastric malignancies or alarm symptoms should be evaluated with esophagogastroduodenoscopy. If gastroparesis is suspected, a gastric emptying study is recommended. In addition to functional causes, it is also important to consider psychiatric causes when evaluating patients with chronic nausea and vomiting.

Case summary

A 57-year-old woman with morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 43), systemic lupus on steroids, type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, unprovoked pulmonary embolism on rivaroxaban, and hypertension presented with 3 days of worsening abdominal pain and nausea. She had an extensive surgical history including a cesarean section, multiple laparotomies for small bowel obstructions (one complicated by bowel perforation requiring resection), and a double-barrelled ileostomy, which had been since reversed. As a result, she had a massive incisional hernia (figure 1). On presentation she was afebrile but tachycardic at 110 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper and lower quadrants. CT demonstrated an 11 mm appendix with an appendicolith outside the hernia sac abutting the right kidney, discontinuity of the appendix tip, free fluid, and associated stranding in the subhepatic region (figure 2A). She was admitted to the surgical floor for a trial of conservative management with ancef and flagyl. On day 3, her pain worsened, her white cell count remained stable at 12 x10 9 /L, her temperature was 37.8°C, she was not tachycardic, and a repeat CT showed a 15 mm perforated appendix with increased periappendiceal stranding and an associated small volume of free fluid. There was no phlegmon or organized abscess (figure 2B).

Case presentation

A 37-year-old female patient, with no significant history, who consulted for 10 h for severe generalized abdominal pain of sudden onset, associated with multiple diarrheal stools without mucus or blood (6 stools in the last hour), without fever, nausea or vomiting. She had no respiratory symptoms or epidemiological exposure at that time. Upon admission to the physical examination, the patient was stable, moderately dehydrated, and with mild tachycardia. During abdominal palpation, she had only severe crampy pain with tenderness, apparently no peritoneal irritation.

The laboratory results included a slightly normal blood count, normal arterial gases, negative pregnancy test, normal urinalysis and liver profile with mild elevation of transaminase (Table 1). Analgesic management with opioid and antispasmodics were initiated given the intensity of pain. An endoscopy was performed showing chronic gastritis and biopsies confirming this condition so she was discharged with ambulatory management.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^113WG96r]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Two patients, a 53-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, presented at the Emergency Department of our hospital with symptoms of acute abdomen without concomitant fever. They both complained of severe acute abdominal pain localized at the right and left lower quadrants respectively, worsening during the last couple of hours, accompanied by moderate nausea. Rebound tenderness was present in the right and left lower abdominal quadrants respectively, with absence of other pathological findings on physical examination. In this setting our diagnostic thought was guided to the possibility of acute appendicitis in the first patient and acute diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or ruptured ovarian cyst in the second one. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. Both patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 1A - D), which established the diagnosis of primary epiploic appendagitis (EA). Patients were administered a single dose of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug intramuscularly with significant clinical improvement and were discharged from the Emergency Department with a short course of ibuprofen and advice to seek medical attention if symptoms worsened. Their clinical response was excellent and symptoms totally resolved three days later.

### Fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device [^111EuNB5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device (IUD) is very rare.

Objectives

To raise awareness of the risk of toxic shock syndrome caused by an IUD, to educate others about when to suspect this complication, and to provide treatment recommendations.

Case Report

A 49-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department in septic shock after complaining of 5 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination findings included a diffusely tender and rigid abdomen with free fluid on bedside sonogram. She was found, on computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, to have an IUD with moderate ascites. The IUD was removed, and both her IUD and her blood cultures grew out group A Streptococcus. Despite aggressive medical management, which included multiple vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she died from group A streptococcal sepsis, with the IUD as her most likely source. Her clinical presentation and laboratory findings meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Her diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy.

Conclusion

IUDs should be considered as a possible source of infection in patients with an IUD who present with symptoms consistent with toxic shock syndrome. These patients need to be aggressively managed with early surgical intervention.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116LhZGa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General Medical — Abdominal pain patient management directs EMS clinicians to perform initial assessment and identify life-threatening etiologies. The guideline states to "Perform airway assessment and management per the Airway Management Guideline" and "Obtain vital signs including pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment". It instructs to "Obtain blood glucose if hyperglycemia is suspected per Hyperglycemia Guideline", "Provide evaluation and management of pain per the Pain Management Guideline", and "Obtain vascular access as necessary to provide analgesia and/or fluid resuscitation". Providers are directed to "Assess for life-threatening causes of abdominal pain, which may include" signs of ischemic, necrotic, or perforated bowel such as "Severe tenderness", "Abdominal pain with motion or palpation of the abdomen", "Fever", "Bloody stool", "Nausea and vomiting", "Absence of passage of stool or gas", and "Abdominal distention, with tympany to percussion"; signs of dissecting or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) including "Unequal femoral or distal lower extremity pulses", "Pulsatile" abdominal mass", "Associated back pain and/or chest pain", and "Known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm"; and signs of ruptured ectopic pregnancy including "Vaginal bleeding", "Recently diagnosed pregnancy", and "Recent missed period/menstrual cycle in women of childbearing age".

### Acute gallbladder torsion-a continued pre-operative diagnostic dilemma [^117PPSCD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute gallbladder volvulus continues to remain a relatively uncommon process, manifesting itself usually during exploration for an acute surgical abdomen with a presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The pathophysiology is that of mechanical organo-axial torsion along the gallbladder's longitudinal axis involving the cystic duct and cystic artery, and with a pre-requisite of local mesenteric redundancy. The demographic tendency is septua- and octo-genarians of the female sex, and its overall incidence is increasing, this being primarily attributed to increasing life expectancy. Despite significant challenges in pre-operative diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and prompt surgical intervention results in an overall mortality of approximately 5 percent.

Case Report One

A 99-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 3 day history of acute onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain with intermittent radiation to the right flank and back. It was described as colicky in nature on a baseline dull character, and with no obvious precipitating, aggravating or relieving factors. Associated phenomena included anorexia and nausea, but no constitutional upset, vomiting, or change in bowel habit. Her medical history included peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled hypertension, tobacco abuse, diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, and dementia. Her surgical history was significant for an appendectomy.

Clinical physical examination revealed an apyrexic frail patient in no acute distress with stable vital signs. Focused abdominal examination demonstrated a soft, mildly distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, and a positive Murphy's sign. There was no overt peritonism. A reducible left inguinal hernia was also appreciated. Laboratory parameters yielded a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and hypokalemia. Her liver function enzymes were elevated in a cholestatic distribution with a total bilirubin of 3.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL, and an alkaline phosphatase of 150 IU/L.

### Acute abdominal pain in children: evaluation and management [^114RHyy1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis.

### Intestinal obstruction caused by encircling fallopian tube [^111bNR8i]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency surgery department with 1-week history of abdominal pain, distension, vomiting and constipation. On examination, she has a distended abdomen with sluggish bowel sounds, but no clinical signs of peritonitis. Blood tests were normal except for the increased white cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). CT scan with oral as well as intravenous contrast demonstrated the small bowel obstruction without any insight into the aetiology of the disease. Intraoperatively, the right fallopian tube was found to encircle the terminal ileum. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed to release the bowel. This case report describes a rare cause of the small bowel obstruction in female patients.

Case presentation

A 49-year-old Caucasian woman, with past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, dyslipidemia and hypertension, presented to the emergency department with cramping-like abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea that started few weeks prior to presentation. Abdominal pain was generalized before becoming localized to the epigastrium, without radiation. No alleviating or aggravating factors were noted. She had frequent, watery to loose, non-bloody bowel movements.

Patient denied dysphagia or odynophagia, and had no fever, chills, skin rashes or joint pains. She denied any recent travel, sick contact or antibiotics use prior to onset of symptoms. Review of systems was unremarkable. Surgical history included cholecystectomy. Patient did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. No family history of similar symptoms.

Patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Prior to hospitalization, patient was evaluated and treated at two different healthcare facilities (including one hospital admission) for similar symptoms. There, she had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast that showed fluid-filled bowels and thickened colonic wall, and she was released from the hospital on empirical antibiotics for presumed infectious enterocolitis, but symptoms recurred soon after hospital discharge.

On physical examination the patient appeared in moderate pain and distress. Vital signs showed an elevated blood pressure of 146/93 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a normal temperature of 36.5 °C.

Abdominal exam showed generalized tenderness that was worse in the epigastrium with no rebound tenderness or abdominal distention. Bowel sounds were normal. There was no palpable organomegaly.

Background

A 49-year-old white female with a history of acute pancreatitis that was complicated by pseudocysts presented with severe acute-onset abdominal pain of a few hours duration with associated vomiting. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness and positive bowel sounds. Initial blood work revealed a drop in her hematocrit, and elevated but stable amylase and lipase levels. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with extravasation of contrast medium into an adjacent pseudocyst.

Investigations

Physical examination, blood analysis and a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast medium.

Diagnosis

Splenic artery pseudoaneurysm bleeding into an adjacent pseudocyst.

Management

Embolization of the splenic artery across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm.

Pharmacologic analgesia harms and interactions indicate that indirect evidence did not report any serious short-term adverse effects from nonopioid analgesics, while nausea and vomiting occurred at higher rates in opioid treatment groups; potential harms include longer term adverse effects such as renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding from NSAIDs, long-term opioid use, and overdose, and some medication combinations are contraindicated (e.g. NSAIDs and anticoagulants, NSAIDs in patients > 65 years of age, concomitant opioids and benzodiazepines); however, use of NSAIDs at the lowest dose possible for the shortest duration possible may offer more benefit than harm.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1157YYp3]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) — epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management are outlined as follows: acute intermittent porphyria is the most common AHP with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 100,000; the major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging, occurring mainly in women in their childbearing years, and AHP should be considered especially in women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes; patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP; the cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics; diagnosis can be confirmed after initial treatment by testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD; AHP is associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risks including systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

### Acute perforated appendicitis with leukopenic presentation [^116EN1Ct]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Most patients with appendicitis had elevated white blood cell count. It is rarely seen with leukopenic presentation in acute appendicitis. Physicians in the emergency department easily miss these cases that had normal white blood cell count and leukopenic presentation. We presented a case of a 38-year-old man who had right lower quadrant abdominal pain with fever. White blood cell count was only 1800/microL. Computed tomography showed thickening with fluid contained in the lumen of distended appendix, and emergent appendectomy was done. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still based on the clinical history and physical examination adjuvant with imaging studies.

### AGA institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^1129zTB7]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues — best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^114juKQK]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior to presenting to our institution, she had presented to an outside hospital ED. She was given a fluid bolus and intravenous ondansetron. An abdominal X-ray performed was read as normal. She was subsequently discharged. Due to persistent symptoms, she presented to our ED that same evening.

Upon presentation to our ED, her initial physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill of 3 to 4 seconds, normoactive bowel sounds, and diffuse abdominal pain with palpation, most notable at the periumbilical region, without peritoneal signs. She was given a fluid bolus for dehydration and intravenous acetaminophen for the abdominal pain. Her blood glucose was 69 mg/dL; she received a 10% dextrose bolus. Her basic metabolic panel was significant for metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyponatremia. Complete blood count with differential showed lymphopenia but was otherwise unremarkable. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Urinalysis was significant for specific gravity greater than 1.030, ketonuria of 80 mg/dL, and 5 to 10 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high power field). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her abdomen and pelvis ruled out appendicitis and revealed trace intra-pelvic free fluid. Stool studies including parasitic panel were sent. She was admitted to the inpatient pediatric service for further workup and care.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^111ZTC1D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Key concepts for portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis — Abdominal pain disproportionate to physical findings on abdominal examination should raise suspicion for portal and/or MVT. Among patients with portal and/or MVT, intestinal ischemia is suspected with the development of fever, ascites, rebound abdominal tenderness, leukocytosis, and elevated serum lactate levels. Doppler ultrasound examination of the hepatic vasculature should be obtained in patients with (i) new diagnosis of cirrhosis, (ii) onset of PH, or (iii) hepatic decompensation. Endoscopic evaluation should be performed in patients with chronic PVT to assess for esophageal and/or gastric varices. More data are needed before implementing routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of PVT in patients with cirrhosis.

### A diagnostic challenge: primary omental torsion and literature review-a case report [^113H2D8C]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Patient with omental torsion present with constant, non-radiating pain of increasing severity, nausea and vomiting. Clinically 50% of patients have a low grade fever and leukocytosis. These findings are non specific, making pre-operative diagnosis of omental torsion a challenge. The majority of cases present with a single episode of abdominal pain but recurrent pain may suggest intermittent torsions. On examination 50% of patients present with an abdominal mass and localised peritonitis. Common differential diagnosis include appendicitis, cholecystitis or twisted ovarian cyst. In general patients with omental torsion are less systemically unwell compared to acute appendicitis and the disease process extends over a longer period of time.

On laboratory findings a moderate leukocytosis is present in 50% of cases. Imaging investigations such as Ultrasonography and Computed Tomography (CT) have been suggested in the literature. On Sonography a complex mass consisting of hypoechoic and solid zones may be identified, but this imaging technique is operator dependent with limited sensitivity due to overlying bowel gas. On CT, omental torsion is characterised by diffuse streaking in a whirling pattern of fibrous and fatty folds. With increased use of CT, pre-operative diagnosis of omental torsion may increase in frequency of preoperative diagnosis and lead to conservative management in patients without complications.

The current investigation tool and therapeutic management of choice is laparoscopy proceeding to laparotomy, identifying and removing the infarcted section of omentum. Normal appendix, gallbladder and pelvic cavity make the diagnosis of omental torsion likely. Free serosanguineous fluid as a result of haemorrhagic extravasion is a characteristic finding in the peritoneal cavity. In the literature the treatment of choice included additional appendicectomy to prevent future diagnostic problems. Successful conservative management has also been reported.

Histology findings of haemorrhagic infarction and fat necrosis confirm the diagnosis with the presence of fibrosis indicative of a longer disease process.

The prognosis for primary omental torsion is good with fast post operative recovery and minimal morbidity. The natural disease progress if left untreated will result in fibrosis, necrosis and occasional autoamputation and clinical improvement. Prognosis in secondary torsion depends in the underlying pathology.

Left sided omental torsion may be commonly misdiagnosed as diverticulutis and managed conservatively, resulting in less common diagnosis.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^111DeDCH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients assessed at the emergency department at Rotorua Public Hospital with acute abdominal pain requiring admission to the surgical unit were enrolled in the prospective study.

Patients were examined by the admitting surgical team after taking a thorough history, Relevant points in the history included the patient's gender, duration of pain, site of pain, character of pain, fever, loss of appetite, change in bowel habit, vomiting, abdominal distension and urinary or genital symptoms.

Factors in the clinical examination that were considered of significant contribution to the final diagnosis included temperature, tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness and localized guarding.

Data was collected prospectively on an electronic database. Patients were followed up with further investigations that included ultrasound scan, CT scan and diagnostic laparotomy as was clinically indicated to ascertain the final diagnosis. All patients were admitted for observation or surgery if indicated.

Non-specific abdominal pain was defined as an abdominal pain in right iliac or hypogastric area lasting more than 6 hours and less than 8 days, without fever, leukocytosis, or obvious peritoneal signs and uncertain diagnosis after physical examination and baseline investigations including abdominal sonography; provide they have totally settled or underwent diagnostic laparoscopy that proved to be normal.

Analysis

Analysis was performed to evaluate the relative contribution and specificity of each individual factor to a definitive final diagnosis that led to identification those who had no definitive diagnosis. The data analyzed using SPSS ® version 10.5. Univariate analysis was performed using simple linear regression; multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in 41 adults: the illness, the patients, and problems of management [^117VbMCv]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The pattern of nausea and vomiting in CVS is unmistakably different from other vomiting disorders. Rumination and bulimia are accompanied by little or no nausea. The nausea related to reflux disease or achalasia is comparatively mild and transient. By contrast, the nausea of a cyclic vomiting episode is accompanied by dramatic autonomic dysfunction, diminished muscle tone and altered mental state causing total incapacitation that persists for the duration of the emetic phase.

The pathogenesis of cyclic vomiting episodes is obscure; their signs and symptoms mimic other disorders. For example, vomiting, abdominal pain, stress-induced neutrophilia and elevated serum amylase of salivary origin may mimic pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, appendicitis or pyelonephritis. Nausea of any etiology may cause myoelectrical abnormalities and delayed gastric emptying suggestive of organic gastroparesis. The periodicity of recurrences, with or without hypertension, mimics porphyria, pheochromocytoma, abdominal epilepsy, intermittent small bowel obstruction or endometriosis. The presence of gallstones or the finding of impaired gallbladder emptying in patients whose cyclic vomiting episodes feature nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain, had prompted cholecystectomies that failed to relieve cyclic vomiting symptoms. Although many organic diseases present a cyclic or recurrent pattern of vomiting, the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome is, by definition, primarily a disorder of function which appears to originate in the central nervous system, not the abdomen.

### Nonhemolytic, nonmotile gram-positive rods indicative of Bacillus anthracis [^117Bao4o]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Case Study

A 40-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was seen at the emergency room because of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain, which had started a few days previously, was constant, localized to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and described as dull and moderately to severely intense. The pain was not related to meals or bowel movements and was not accentuated or relieved by any specific position. The patient noted constipation but had no nausea or vomiting. No rectal bleed or melena occurred, and she reported no urinary symptoms or vaginal discharge. Her last normal menstrual period was 8 days before. She felt warm but did not check her temperature and did not experience chills. Her primary medical physician prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for the presumptive diagnosis of colitis. She took the antibiotic for 2 days without improvement.

In the emergency room, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The physical examination showed tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with minimal rebound tenderness. The pelvic examination showed left adnexal tenderness with a possible mass. Results of urinalysis and a urine pregnancy test were negative. No leukocytosis was noted. A pelvic ultrasonograph showed a left ovarian complex mass measuring 14 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm as well as a moderate amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. The study suggested left ovarian mass torsion. A laparascopic resection was performed successfully. The patient received intravenous cefazolin perioperatively. The final pathology report showed a mature teratoma of the left ovary featuring dermoid cyst, respiratory anlaga, and struma ovarii. The patient improved and was discharged 2 days after surgery.

### CT imaging findings of epiploic appendagitis: an unusual cause of abdominal pain [^112pgiSH]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical signs or laboratory markers. Clinical presentation may vary among patients. This condition is often an underestimated and overlooked mimicker, easily misdiagnosed with other causes of abdominal pain requiring urgent care or surgical evaluation in emergency department, particularly acute diverticulitis (left iliac pain) or acute appendicitis (right iliac pain). On physical examination, patients complain of focal non-migratory abdominal pain in the lower abdominal quadrants (left more commonly than right), not exacerbated by physical movement, without significant guarding or rigidity, and in the absence of a palpable mass. The pain is typically circumscribed and the patient may often point his finger on the place where the lesion is situated. Patients may also report postprandial fullness, swelling, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and rarely mild fever. White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal range in the majority of patients, while mild leukocytosis may occasionally be observed due to inflammatory response.

Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, self-limiting condition which spontaneously resolves within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Surgery is not indicated, since the treatment is conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the patient's symptoms. The risk of recurrence is low and complications are even rarer. Some authors believed that surgical intervention with ligation and excision of the inflamed epiploic appendages was the only way to prevent recurrences and complications, such as adhesions and intussusception induced by inflammation. However, invasive intervention is usually avoided due to the potential complications present in all surgical procedures. In some cases, epiploic appendagitis has been reported as an unexpected finding in patients who underwent laparotomy for acute abdominal pain with clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis or acute diverticulitis. It can also be a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of acute abdominal pain are disproved.

### Acute small bowel obstruction secondary to intestinal endometriosis, an elusive condition: a case report [^114rnUWt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 33 year old woman of Asian origin was admitted to our Colorectal Unit with a one day history of absolute constipation and haematochesia. This was associated with a one week history of emesis that had gradually increased in severity. The patient was complaining of a one month history of generalised colicky abdominal pain. On the day of admission, the pain was described as severe and was scored as 10 out of 10. The constipation had commenced a month prior following her menses and had insidiously increased in severity. The patient's past medical history included three uncomplicated Caesarean sections and was otherwise unremarkable. At the time of admission, she was taking the oral contraceptive pill. She was a non-smoker and drank alcohol very occasionally. There was no family history of bowel cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. On examination the patient was comfortable at rest, haemodynamically stable and afebrile. Inspection revealed a distended abdomen with an obvious Pfannenstiel scar. On palpation, there was generalised tenderness with no rigidity or rebound tenderness. No herniae were found. Auscultation revealed tinkling bowel sounds. Per rectal examination demonstrated soft stool. Laboratory tests revealed a raised white cell count of 12700/mm3, a normal haemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL and an elevated C-reactive protein of 186 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas demonstrated a mild metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.461 and a base excess of 1.4. A urine dipstick and pregnancy test were both unremarkable. A supine abdominal radiograph showed dilated loops of small bowel. A CT abdomen/pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast was performed. This was reported as showing small bowel obstruction with a transition point at the terminal ileum which was thickened and stenosed. The CT appearances were suggestive of either Crohn's disease or Tuberculosis. The patient was treated conservatively with nasogastric suction and intravenous fluids. The patient initially responded well eventually regaining bowel function. However, the patient then suddenly redeveloped signs and symptoms of obstruction. Due to a rapid deterioration in the patient's condition a histological diagnosis could not be achieved prior to surgery. After obtaining informed consent from the patient, an emergency lower midline laparotomy was performed. Intra-operatively a dilated proximal small bowel was found with one constricting lesion affecting the ileocaecal junction which seemed to arise from the base of the appendix. The macroscopic appearances were suggestive of a malignancy. No other lesions were found. A right hemicolectomy was performed with a side to side stapled ileocolic anastomosis. Histological examination of the specimen was found to show a macroscopic the ileocaecal valve was compressed by outside mass and the mucosa showed an 8 mm fibrotic nodule occupying the appendiceal base which was on microscopy diagnostic of extensive endometriosis (see figures 1 & 2). The patient made an uneventful post-operative recovery and was discharged. At outpatient follow up, the patient had not experienced any further symptoms and was well.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — risk predictors, imaging, and definitions in diverticulitis: Among patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, "predictors of progression to complicated disease include symptoms lasting longer than 5 days, vomiting, systemic comorbidity, a leukocyte count greater than 13.5 × 10⁹ cells/L, high C-reactive protein levels (> 140 mg/L), CT findings of pericolic extraluminal air, fluid collection, or a longer inflamed colon segment". Implementation notes state that diagnosis "does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess". Definitions clarify that "Uncomplicated diverticulitis refers to localized inflammation, whereas complicated diverticulitis refers to inflammation associated with an abscess, a phlegmon, a fistula, an obstruction, bleeding, or perforation".

### Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus… [^116P4roe]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common manifestation of gastrointestinal involvement in patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common cause of SLE is intraabdominal vasculitis, a dangerous manifestation that results in ischemia and intestinal infarction. Diagnosing acute primary mesenteric ischemia is challenging. Prompt, intensive radiographic evaluation of patients with SLE and acute abdominal pain is essential to identify the potential causes of the pain. Plain radiographs of the abdomen or contrast material–enhanced radiographs of the bowel are often normal or nonspecific. Byun and associates conducted a retrospective review of computed tomographic scans in a series of patients with SLE and acute abdominal pain to identify any distinguishing features. Thirty-nine CT scans from 33 patients who met the diagnostic criteria were reviewed by two experienced radiologists, and diagnoses were reached by consensus.

A CT examination was performed within two days of the onset of pain. All patients reported repeated episodes of abdominal pain and were taking low-dose oral prednisone at the time of presentation. A CT diagnosis of ischemic bowel disease was made if the patient had at least three of the following signs: bowel wall thickening, target sign, dilation of intestinal segments, engorgement of mesenteric vessels or increased attenuation of mesenteric fat. Thirty-one CT scans showed one or more of the defined characteristics of ischemic bowel disease. Of these, 29 had circumferential, symmetric bowel wall thickening, primarily at the jejunum and ileum. Most of these scans also demonstrated the target sign. In 24 of the scans, the thickening appeared to be multisegmented, was of variable length and did not appear to be confined to a single vascular territory.

Engorgement of the mesenteric vessels and increased attenuation of mesenteric fat adjacent to the involved bowel loops were evident in all scans. Ascites was also noted in 27 scans. In patients whose CT findings showed no apparent ischemic bowel disease, other conditions, such as splenic infarction, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, pancreatic cancer, liver abscess and lupus nephritis were discovered. Six patients with CT findings of ischemic bowel disease had an acute recurrence of abdominal pain after recovery from the initial episode. Repeat CT scans were obtained one to 32 months after the initial examination. In five patients, CT findings of ischemic bowel were noted again with partial regression and little change or progression when compared with the initial scans. The authors conclude that a CT examination was useful for identifying the primary causes of acute abdominal pain in patients with SLE.

These findings were also useful in planning treatment and in monitoring for infarction and perforation. Although ischemic bowel disease was evident on the CT scans of most of the patients, variable findings were seen in eight patients without CT findings of ischemia. Although CT proved to be more sensitive than specific, it may provide a more accurate way to diagnose acute mesenteric ischemia and reduce life-threatening complications.
