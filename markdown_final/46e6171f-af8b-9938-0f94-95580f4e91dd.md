## Question

A 56-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) presents for routine follow-up. She reports mild exertional dyspnea but is otherwise stable. Her medications include an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. On examination, her oxygen saturation is 89% on room air at rest. She is not currently using supplemental oxygen at home.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate management regarding supplemental oxygen for this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 56-year-old woman with idiopathic PAH and a resting room-air SpO2 of 89% should start long-term supplemental oxygen therapy, and how to determine the appropriate flow and targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this degree of hypoxemia meets guideline thresholds for long-term oxygen therapy in PAH. Then, I should verify whether pulse oximetry alone is sufficient or if arterial blood gas confirmation is required. Next, I will consider the pathophysiologic rationale for oxygen in PAH and the strength of evidence. After that, I need to check practical prescribing details, including initial flow, titration, and follow-up reassessment. Finally, I should review special situations like air travel and exertional desaturation, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the threshold question. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on initiating long-term oxygen therapy in PAH when arterial oxygen pressure is less than 8 kPa, which equals 60 mmHg, or when SaO2 is less than about 91–92% on at least two occasions, with the aim to achieve PaO2 greater than 8 kPa or SpO2 greater than about 90% at rest [^f26f6d6c] [^9691e7bc] [^24919a81] [^73d80054]. Wait, let me verify the conversion and the "two occasions" nuance: yes, 8 kPa is 60 mmHg, and both ESC/ERS and Canadian statements emphasize confirming hypoxemia on more than one measurement before committing to LTOT, which is exactly why an ABG is the next step here [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on pulse oximetry alone. I need to check whether oximetry at 89% is enough to diagnose chronic hypoxemia qualifying for LTOT. The answer is no; oximetry correlates imperfectly with PaO2, and guidelines advise obtaining an arterial blood gas to confirm resting hypoxemia and to establish a baseline for titration and follow-up, especially when SpO2 is 92% or lower at rest [^15049293] [^f26f6d6c]. I should confirm that the ABG is obtained on room air after a period of stability, and if the PaO2 is 60 mmHg or less, that meets criteria for LTOT in PAH [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiologic rationale and evidence strength. Hypoxemia worsens pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular afterload in PAH, so correcting hypoxemia is mechanistically sound, but I need to be honest: high-quality randomized trial data for survival benefit of LTOT in PAH are limited, and recommendations often extrapolate from COPD and observational PAH data, including REVEAL suggesting improved survival in those with severe DLCO reduction who use oxygen, albeit with confounding by indication [^1727f02a] [^6ccb51d4]. Let me reconsider: despite the evidence gap, contemporary PAH guidelines still recommend LTOT when PaO2 is 60 mmHg or less because of potential symptom and hemodynamic benefits, which aligns with best practice here [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81].

> I will now examine practical prescribing details. If ABG confirms PaO2 60 mmHg or less, I should prescribe long-term oxygen with a typical starting flow of 1 L/min via nasal cannula and titrate in 1 L/min increments to achieve a resting SpO2 greater than 90% and a PaO2 greater than 8 kPa, with reassessment of ABG once stable to document the effective prescription [^af925c91] [^73d80054]. Wait, I should double-check the target: some statements allow SaO2 greater than about 90–92% as an acceptable surrogate when ABG is not immediately available, but confirming PaO2 is preferred when feasible, and I need to ensure we avoid over-oxygenation that could suppress hypoxic drive in susceptible phenotypes, even though PAH itself is not typically hypercapnic [^f26f6d6c] [^3c44a15f].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment. I need to ensure we recheck ABG or oximetry in 60–90 days after initiating LTOT to confirm ongoing indication and adequacy of the prescription, adjusting flow if needed and discontinuing if hypoxemia resolves, mirroring COPD best practices for reassessment even though this patient has PAH rather than COPD [^cf46137b] [^5b5cec6e]. Hold on, I should verify that this interval is reasonable in PAH; while the strongest reassessment language is in COPD guidelines, the principle of verifying continued benefit and correct dosing is sound and widely adopted in oxygen programs [^cf46137b].

> But wait, what if her exertional symptoms reflect exercise-induced desaturation rather than resting hypoxemia alone. I should consider ambulatory oxygen for documented exertional desaturation to SpO2 88% or less if it improves dyspnea or exercise capacity, recognizing that evidence is mixed and decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and standardized exertional testing when possible [^d9bc747e] [^9691e7bc]. Let me verify the threshold: yes, many programs operationalize exertional hypoxemia as SpO2 88% or less during activity, and PAH guidance allows consideration of ambulatory oxygen when there is symptomatic benefit and correctable desaturation on exertion, which fits if her 6-minute walk or corridor walk shows significant desaturation with symptoms [^d9bc747e] [^9691e7bc].

> I should also confirm travel and altitude guidance. For air travel or altitudes above about 1500–2000 meters, patients with PAH and borderline saturations at sea level should use supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 greater than 91%, typically requiring 2–4 L/min in flight depending on baseline, and those already on oxygen should increase their flow during flight or altitude exposure [^44b55424] [^57e95e83] [^60322ec5]. Hold on, I should verify the in-flight flow: guidance suggests 2 L/min can approximate sea-level oxygenation in many patients, but individual needs vary, so pre-travel planning and, when available, high-altitude simulation testing can refine the prescription [^60322ec5].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Given resting SpO2 of 89% on room air, I should order an arterial blood gas to confirm chronic hypoxemia; if PaO2 is 60 mmHg or less on two occasions, I should initiate long-term oxygen therapy, start at 1 L/min and titrate to achieve SpO2 greater than 90% and PaO2 greater than 8 kPa, document the effective prescription with a follow-up ABG in 60–90 days, and counsel on adherence and activity use; if PaO2 is above 60 mmHg but she has symptomatic exertional desaturation, I should consider ambulatory oxygen with structured reassessment of benefit [^f26f6d6c] [^af925c91] [^cf46137b] [^9691e7bc]. I need to ensure we also provide travel counseling and, if she flies or ascends, arrange in-flight or altitude oxygen to keep SpO2 greater than 91% [^44b55424] [^60322ec5].

> Final answer: Yes, obtain an arterial blood gas to confirm resting hypoxemia; if PaO2 is 60 mmHg or less, initiate long-term supplemental oxygen with a starting flow of 1 L/min and titrate to maintain SpO2 greater than 90% and PaO2 greater than 8 kPa, with reassessment in 60–90 days; if PaO2 is above 60 mmHg but there is documented exertional desaturation with symptoms, consider ambulatory oxygen and reassess benefit, and plan for supplemental oxygen during air travel or high-altitude exposure to maintain SpO2 greater than 91% [^f26f6d6c] [^af925c91] [^cf46137b] [^9691e7bc] [^44b55424].

The most appropriate management is to **initiate long-term supplemental oxygen** because her resting SpO2 is 89% on room air, which meets the threshold for hypoxemia in PAH [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81]. The goal is to **maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%** at rest, during exertion, and during sleep [^1e420ad0] [^84faafe7]. Ambulatory oxygen should be considered if desaturation occurs with activity, and in-flight oxygen is recommended for air travel or high altitude to keep SpO2 > 91% [^44b55424] [^57e95e83]. Reassess oxygen needs at follow-up and adjust the flow rate as needed [^cf46137b].

## Indications for supplemental oxygen in PAH

Current guidelines recommend supplemental oxygen for PAH patients with **chronic hypoxemia**, typically defined as:

- **PaO2 ≤ 8 kPa (60 mmHg)** or SpO2 < 90% at rest on room air [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81].
- **Signs of tissue hypoxia**, such as polycythemia (hematocrit ≥ 55%), peripheral edema, or cor pulmonale [^63c067cd].

The patient has a resting SpO2 of 89%, which meets the criterion for hypoxemia; therefore, **initiating supplemental oxygen is indicated** [^f26f6d6c] [^24919a81].

---

## Goals of oxygen therapy in PAH

The primary goals of oxygen therapy in PAH are to:

- **Improve oxygenation**: Maintain PaO2 > 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SpO2 ≥ 90% at rest, during exertion, and during sleep [^f26f6d6c] [^1e420ad0].
- **Reduce pulmonary vascular resistance**: Alleviate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and lower right ventricular afterload [^1727f02a].
- **Enhance exercise capacity and quality of life**: Reduce dyspnea and fatigue, improving daily functioning [^d9bc747e].

---

## Practical implementation of oxygen therapy

### Initial prescription and titration

- **Initial flow rate**: Start at 1–2 L/min via nasal cannula and titrate to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^af925c91].
- **Titration**: Adjust the flow rate based on resting, exertional, and nocturnal oximetry to ensure adequate oxygenation [^af925c91].
- **Documentation**: Record the prescribed flow rate, duration of use, and target SpO2 [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **oxygen needs**, adherence, and response. Reassess at 3–6 month intervals or if clinical status changes [^cf46137b]. At each visit, monitor SpO2 at rest, during exertion, and during sleep, and adjust oxygen flow as needed [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Ambulatory oxygen

Consider **ambulatory oxygen** if the patient experiences exertional desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) with activity, as it can improve exercise capacity and reduce dyspnea [^9691e7bc] [^d9bc747e].

---

### Nocturnal oxygen

Assess for **nocturnal hypoxemia** with overnight oximetry or polysomnography if symptoms suggest sleep-disordered breathing or nocturnal desaturation, and use nocturnal oxygen if indicated [^3c44a15f] [^9691e7bc].

---

### Air travel and high altitude

During air travel or at high altitude (> 1,500 m), use **supplemental oxygen** to maintain SpO2 > 91% [^44b55424] [^57e95e83]. Patients with borderline saturations at sea level may require 3–4 L/min in flight [^57e95e83].

---

## Potential benefits and risks

Benefits include improved oxygenation, reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, better exercise capacity, and enhanced quality of life [^1727f02a] [^d9bc747e]. Risks include nasal irritation, dryness, dependence, and rare hypercapnia in susceptible patients; monitor for CO2 retention in those at risk [^662b415f].

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: an update on diagnosis and treatment [^6bee1785]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or 30 mm Hg during physical activity. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is classified into subgroups, including idiopathic, heritable, and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with other conditions. A detailed history, thorough physical examination, and most importantly, a high index of suspicion are essential to diagnosis. Evaluation includes echocardiography and exclusion of other causes of symptoms. Targeted laboratory testing can help identify the subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Right heart catheterization is required to confirm the diagnosis. Standard treatment options include oral anticoagulation, diuretics, oxygen supplementation, and for a small percentage of patients, calcium channel blockers. Newer treatments include prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Combination therapy has been shown to improve pulmonary arterial pressure, but more research is needed. Interventional procedures for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension include balloon atrial septostomy and lung transplantation.

### Understanding facilitators and barriers to oxygen therapy for patients with interstitial lung disease [^d11fb31b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is comprised of a heterogenous group of pulmonary diseases, often characterised by the development of a progressive parenchymal fibrosis, leading to restrictive ventilatory patterns and, eventually, in the most severe forms, to respiratory failure and death. Management of ILD is complex; patients frequently experience diagnostic and referral delays, and require both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches. Recent national and international guidelines address the diagnosis and management of this complex condition. Oxygen therapy is used in patients with advanced lung disease with resting hypoxemia; however, there is limited evidence regarding its clinical efficacy for patients with ILD, and often data are extrapolated from studies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This lack of evidence, particularly related to oxygen therapy in patients with exertional hypoxemia, has created discrepancies in clinical approaches and recommendations, causing a need for evidence-based guidelines focusing on patient-centred outcomes.

A recent modified Delphi survey of ILD experts determined that oxygen therapy should be recommended to patients with ILD who exhibit severe resting hypoxemia or exertional desaturation of SpO 2 to < 85%–89%, especially for those experiencing symptoms or reduced exercise capacity. Research has demonstrated that ambulatory oxygen improves breathlessness and cough symptoms in individuals with ILD that are not hypoxemic at rest, but develop exertional desaturation on exercise. International guidelines suggest that patients with ILD who experience a PaO 2 at or below 7.3 kPa (55 mm Hg), or a PaO 2 below 8.0 kPa (60 mm Hg) with pulmonary hypertension and breathlessness may benefit from at-home/ambulatory oxygen therapy. Moreover, the guidelines suggest that patients who show improvements in breathlessness and hypoxemia through the use of oxygen therapy should be considered for a prescription of supplemental oxygen. However, agencies that fund healthcare implement their own requirements for funding of oxygen therapy, with limited guidance on criteria identifying which patients should be provided oxygen. The process often requires extensive and repeated testing to qualify for and maintain supplemental oxygen therapy funding.

Patients aged 18 years or older with pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with ERA plus PDE5i with records from July 2015 through June 2022 were duplicated to TOT and DOT and artificially censored when observed treatment deviated from assigned treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures Adjusted risk of all-cause hospitalization, PAH-related hospitalization, and PAH-related disease progression over a 2-year follow-up. Results. A total of 2966 patients with PAH met eligibility criteria. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, life-threatening disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling to increase pulmonary-artery pressure and, ultimately, right heart failure and premature death.

Up-front double oral therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor is considered the standard-of-care treatment for patients at low and intermediate risk.

1. Evidence of the treatment effect of TOT with oral selexipag vs DOT among patients with PAH has been generated mostly from randomized clinical trials and focuses on clinical outcomes. 3 In a post hoc analysis of the pivotal GRIPHON trial, treatment with added oral selexipag vs existing treatment with ERA, PDE5i. In this comparative effectiveness study, we emulated a hypothetical trial in which patients with PAH stabilized on treatment with DOT consisting of ERA and PDE5i for 60 days could be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: a TOT group in which oral selexipag could be added at any time within the first 6 months after randomization or a placebo group in which patients were continuously treated with DOT only.

Time zero was defined as the 61st day of patient use of ERA and PDE5i. The target trial was emulated using closed medical and outpatient, pharmacy-dispensed claims between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022, from the Komodo Health payer-complete dataset derived from more than 150 private insurers in the US. Our trial emulation included patients who used ERA and PDE5i for 60 or more days between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2022. We followed up each patient until the occurrence of the outcome of interest, insurance plan disenrollment, or data cutoff or a maximum of 2 years, whichever happened first. The primary study end point was all-cause hospitalization.

### Use of supplemental oxygen in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in REVEAL [^6ccb51d4]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Supplemental low-flow oxygen is recommended by treatment guidelines as supportive therapy for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), based largely on expert opinion. Reduced diffusing capacity of lung carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with increased mortality in PAH. Reduced DLCO is also associated with relative hypoxemia, making the effects of supplemental oxygen use of particular interest in this sub-population.

Methods

Patients in the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL), a 5-year observational study of Group 1 PAH, were categorized by presence or absence of supplemental oxygen use and by degree of DLCO reduction. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated by group.

Results

Of 3,046 patients, 57% used supplemental oxygen and 43% did not. Supplemental oxygen users had worse prognostic factors and more PAH-specific medication use. Of the 424 patients with severe DLCO reduction (< 40% of predicted), 76% used oxygen and 24% did not. Patients with severe DLCO reduction who used supplemental oxygen had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who did not (hazard ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83; p = 0.0033). This was true for newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients. There was no relationship between oxygen use and outcomes in patients with no, mild, or moderate DLCO reduction.

Conclusions

In this observational study, the risk of death was significantly lower for patients with severe DLCO reduction who received supplemental oxygen compared with those who did not. A randomized trial is warranted to further investigate the relationship between supplemental oxygen use and outcomes in PAH.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bbc97395]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for the recommendation

The panel concluded that the certainty of evidence was moderate and was based on a single clinical trial that used Sp O 2 of 89–93% to define moderate hypoxemia. Similar results were noted in a trial by Górecka and colleagues, which compared LTOT plus monthly home visits by a nurse versus monthly home visits by a nurse alone in patients with moderate resting hypoxemia as defined by a Pa O 2 of 56–65 mm Hg. There was probably no important uncertainty or variability about how much people value mortality as the critical outcome. Some patients may not experience any value added on additional life years if they are very ill. However, this is less likely in patients with moderate hypoxemia, as they tend to have less severe COPD than those with severe resting hypoxemia. The balance between desirable and undesirable effects does not favor LTOT in those with moderate hypoxemia.

ATS recommendation

In adults with COPD who have moderate chronic resting room air hypoxemia, we suggest not prescribing LTOT (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

What others are saying

Only one guideline was found that makes recommendations regarding LTOT in patients with moderate resting hypoxemia. The 2020 GOLD document states, "In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long-term oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely. However, individual patient factors must be considered when evaluating the patient's need for supplemental oxygen".

Implementation considerations

On the basis of the LOTT study, we defined moderate resting hypoxemia as an Sp O 2 of 89–93%. The corresponding Pa O 2 was not reported. The costs and burden of the treatment outweigh the minimal benefit of LTOT in adults with COPD who have moderate resting room air hypoxemia. Patients likely would not choose LTOT on the basis of the lack of benefit; they may decide to defer using oxygen at rest until their resting hypoxemia worsens. The LOTT study did not report any data on pulmonary hemodynamics, and it is therefore not possible to conclude whether effects of LTOT in this group of patients differs according to the presence of PH. When patients have moderate resting hypoxemia, it is an opportunity for shared decision-making between the clinician and patient (see Table 2, which discusses the situations that provide an opportunity for shared decision-making).

Values and preferences

This recommendation against LTOT in this setting places a high value on the absence of a mortality reduction and a lower value on short-term improvement in HRQL (which was observed at 4 mo but not at 12 mo).

European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) travel and oxygen supplementation: There are no studies using flight simulation to determine the need for supplemental oxygen during prolonged flights in PAH, but in‑flight oxygen should be considered for patients in World Health Organization functional class (WHO‑FC) III and IV and for those with arterial oxygen saturation < 90% at sea level. Because hypoxia affects the pulmonary circulation, patients should be advised to avoid going to altitudes above 1500–2000 m without supplemental oxygen and to carry written information about their PAH, including how to contact nearby pulmonary hypertension clinics.

### Supplemental oxygen needs during sleep. who benefits? [^662b415f]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic changes that occur in ventilation during sleep contribute to nocturnal oxygen desaturation in those with lung disease. Nocturnal supplemental oxygen is often used as therapy, although convincing data exist only for those who are hypoxemic both during sleep and wake. Ongoing trials may help address whether oxygen should be used in those with only desaturation during sleep. If used, oxygen should be dosed as needed, and patients should be monitored for hypercapnia. Because of its prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea may commonly overlap with lung disease in many patients and have important consequences. Patients with overlap syndromes may be good candidates for noninvasive ventilation during sleep.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^60322ec5]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Travel and altitude — during air travel at normal cabin pressures corresponding to altitudes up to 2438 m, the PaO2 decreases to that of an inspired O2 fraction of 15.1% at sea level, and evidence suggests that short-term (less than 1 day) normobaric hypoxia is generally well tolerated in clinically stable patients with PAH. In-flight oxygen administration is advised for patients using oxygen at sea level and for those with PaO2 < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO2 < 92%; an oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min will raise in-flight oxygen pressure to values as at sea level, and patients already using oxygen at sea level should increase their oxygen flow rate. As the effects of moderate to long-term hypoxia remain largely unexplored in PAH, patients should avoid altitudes > 1500 m without supplemental oxygen, although day trips to 2500 m have been tolerated in patients not hypoxaemic at sea level.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^d9bc747e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementation considerations

We defined exertional hypoxemia as an Sp O 2 ≤ 88%. Ambulatory oxygen seems to have similar effects in patients who are eligible for LTOT and in those who have isolated exertional hypoxemia. In patients who are eligible for LTOT, prescription of ambulatory oxygen may be important to increase the daily hours of oxygen usage. Individuals who experience a reduction in dyspnea or increased activity levels with ambulatory oxygen may be more likely to benefit from, and adhere to, this therapy. Standardization of the level of exertion is critical when assessing the effects of oxygen on dyspnea. Ambulatory oxygen devices vary in terms of portability, volume, and flow; shared decision-making between the patient and provider is necessary to ensure that the device prescription meets the patient's needs and goals.

Values and preferences

This recommendation places a high value on increasing HRQL and the potential for facilitating physical activity outside the home and places a lower value on cost, inconvenience, and resource use.

Research needs

Given the well-documented burden of ambulatory oxygen, there is an urgent need for new ambulatory oxygen devices that increase portability (improved battery life, weight, flow rates, wireless connections, etc.). Although we found several studies evaluating the effects of oxygen during laboratory testing, few studies evaluated ambulatory oxygen during daily life activities, the context for which it is prescribed. Future studies of ambulatory oxygen should address patient-centered outcomes such as HRQL and physical activity in daily life, together with outcomes pertinent to cost-effectiveness, such as productivity, days missed from work, and hospital readmissions. Future studies should also capture costs of care for other health conditions that may occur because of physical inactivity, which could be reduced with ambulatory oxygen.

Question 4: Should long-term oxygen be prescribed for adults with ILD who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia?

Background

Severe resting hypoxemia is highly prevalent in adults living with ILD. Those with fibrotic forms of ILD, such as IPF, often experience a progressive course characterized by breathlessness, cough, hypoxemia, episodes of acute respiratory worsening, and early death. When present, severe resting hypoxemia often contributes to disabling and distressing breathlessness, which is common in ILD. With the exception of lung transplantation, supplemental oxygen is the only treatment that improves hypoxemia that persists despite optimal medical management of the underlying disease.

The critical outcome for this question was mortality; important outcomes were dyspnea, fatigue, HRQL, physical activity in daily life, healthcare resource use, exercise capacity, and safety.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with adult congenital heart disease — management setting and supportive care recommend that 'PAH associated with CHD patients should be managed in specialized centres' and that 'Patient education, behavioural modifications and awareness of potential medical risks are important aspects of management'. For activity and pregnancy, 'It is recommended to avoid strenuous exercise, but mild activities seem to be beneficial' and 'Pregnancy is associated with very high risk to both the mother and the foetus and should be discouraged. Hence effective contraception is mandatory. Oral contraception is indicated in patients taking ERAs in light of the interaction with progesterone-based compounds'. Oxygen therapy notes that 'Long-term home O2 therapy may improve symptoms but has not been shown to modify survival, at least when given only at night' and 'The use of supplemental O2 therapy is recommended in cases in which it produces a consistent increase in arterial O2 saturation and reduces symptoms'. Anticoagulation 'may be considered in patients with PA thrombosis, signs of heart failure and absent or only mild haemoptysis'. Haematology management advises that 'Secondary erythrocytosis is beneficial for adequate O2 transport and delivery and routine phlebotomy should be avoided. If symptoms of hyperviscosity are present, phlebotomy with isovolumic replacement should be performed, usually when the haematocrit is > 65%. Iron deficiency should be corrected'.

Scenario 2: dual circulation with impaired native gas exchange

A 48-year-old woman with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure and right ventricular failure, with preserved left ventricular systolic function. She was placed on peripheral venoarterial ECMO after exhibiting signs of worsening right ventricular function. She received intravenous fluids to maintain adequate ECMO blood flow, but this led to pulmonary oedema with subsequent worsening of upper body oxygenation as measured on her right radial ABG, which showed a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) of 53 mm Hg and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) of 66 mm Hg. She had multiple desaturation events with worsening shortness of breath despite maximal non-invasive supplemental oxygen, the addition of inhaled nitric oxide, and increases in ECMO blood flow rate. Her preserved left ventricular function combined with impaired native lung gas exchange resulted in the delivery of hypoxemic blood to the innominate artery and potentially to additional vessels off the aortic arch, depending on the precise location of the mixing point. Oxygenation, as supplied by the ECMO circuit, was limited to the vasculature distal to the mixing point.

Oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement — use in COPD: Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate arterial oxygen saturation and need for supplemental oxygen at the point-of-care and should be used to assess all patients with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure or right heart failure. If peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is ≤ 92%, arterial blood gases should be measured due to the imperfect correlation between oximetry and arterial blood gas. Pulse oximetry does not provide information on PaCO2 or pH, which may have potential therapeutic implications.

### Pulmonary hypertension in parenchymal lung diseases: any future for new therapies? [^df2438f5]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to chronic lung disease is associated with a poor prognosis, regardless of the underlying respiratory condition. Updated PH guidelines recommend optimal treatment of the underlying lung disease, including long-term oxygen therapy, in patients with chronic hypoxemia despite the lack of randomized controlled clinical trials supporting this statement. So far, randomized controlled trials of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension have yielded discouraging results in both interstitial lung diseases and COPD with PH. In some cases, the trials were terminated because of an increase in death and other major adverse events in the active treatment arm vs placebo. In cases of PH due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, new therapies under investigation use a combination of novel antifibrotic treatments and other treatments approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The choice of robust end points as well as a target group of patients with specific hemodynamic criteria may help in the selection of innovative therapeutic strategies. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies and clinical trials for the treatment of PH due to the main chronic respiratory diseases and to discuss possible future scenarios for the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies.

Research needs

The panel recommends studies on the use of shared decision-making to personalize the use of home oxygen in participants with moderate resting hypoxemia, as well as studies evaluating the discontinuation of supplemental oxygen in patients who previously had severe resting room air hypoxemia but now have moderate resting room air hypoxemia. Confirmatory evidence is needed to determine the effect of LTOT on dyspnea and other outcomes for patients with moderate resting hypoxemia.

Question 3: Should ambulatory oxygen be prescribed for adults with COPD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia?

Background

Exertional hypoxemia occurs in up to 40% of people with moderate to severe COPD who have normoxemia at rest. It is seen most frequently in those with low lung function (FEV 1 < 45%, D CO < 50%), in those with low resting saturation (< 95%), and in women. The imbalance between oxygen delivery and demand is a major contributor. Exertional hypoxemia is linked to more rapid decline in lung function, worse HRQL, and increased mortality. In 576 people with severe COPD followed for at least 3 years, mortality in those with isolated exertional hypoxemia on a 6MWT was 2.63-fold higher than in those without exertional hypoxemia (95% CI, 1.53–4.51).

"Ambulatory oxygen" is defined as oxygen delivered during exercise or activities of daily living when the individual is walking freely (Table 3). It is prescribed for people with COPD to improve oxygen delivery during exertion, reduce symptoms, and enhance physical capacity. It may be prescribed for individuals using LTOT who require a portable oxygen supply when leaving the house or for those with isolated exertional hypoxemia. Although the beneficial effects of supplemental oxygen during laboratory-based exercise tests have been reported in COPD, clinical trials of ambulatory oxygen used during daily life have had less consistent results. There is variation in prescribing practices and access to ambulatory oxygen across jurisdictions.

The prespecified critical outcome for this question was HRQL; important outcomes included dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, physical activity, mortality, healthcare resource use, and safety.

Introduction

Five million adults live with chronic lung disease in the United States, with more than one million prescribed LTOT, defined as oxygen prescribed for at least 15 h/d. The rationale for the provision of LTOT in adults is based on the survival benefit reported by two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published over three decades ago in patients with COPD and severe, chronic hypoxemia. Since then, an additional clinical trial has examined the role of home oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and moderate resting hypoxemia or exertion-only hypoxemia (LOTT [Long-Term Oxygen Therapy Trial]).

Although several professional societies and groups have published clinical practice guidelines for home oxygen therapy, most have not incorporated the recent LOTT results. Recent data highlight significant differences in home oxygen needs and experiences across patients with different lung diseases, lifestyles, and oxygen supply requirements. For example, the physiologic mechanisms of hypoxemia differ between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The rapid and steep rate of exertional desaturation for patients with ILD differs from that of those with COPD. These considerations highlight the need for guidelines specific to individuals with COPD and ILD, the two major diagnosis entities for which oxygen therapy is prescribed.

The 2017 American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop on optimizing home oxygen therapy identified the lack of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for appropriate use of home oxygen as a critical gap in the care of patients. Workshop proceedings suggested a need for additional research on portable oxygen technology, advocacy for improved financing of oxygen therapy, and updated guidelines to guide policy, advocacy, and practice, as none currently exist in the United States.

Our aim was to conduct a rigorous and systematic review and develop clinical guidelines targeting healthcare providers who care for adults living with chronic lung disease who need oxygen in the community outside of inpatient and emergency settings. In applying these guidelines, clinicians should use an interactive, shared decision-making approach to ensure oxygen prescriptions meet the needs of individual patients by considering physiology, lifestyle, and treatment preferences. The systematic review underpinning this guideline did not specifically address supplemental oxygen use for patients with acute hypoxemia or for patients with signs of cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or polycythemia. However, the panel agreed that clinical guidance related to hypoxemia and PH should be included when pertinent to each question.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### Updated evidence-based treatment algorithm in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^52c03dca]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials with different compounds and procedures are reviewed to define the risk-benefit profiles for therapeutic options in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A grading system for the level of evidence of treatments based on the controlled clinical trials performed with each compound is used to propose an evidence-based treatment algorithm. The algorithm includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of PAH and/or drugs available for other indications. The different treatments have been evaluated mainly in idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, and in PAH associated with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases or with anorexigen use. Extrapolation of these recommendations to other PAH subgroups should be done with caution. Oral anticoagulation is proposed for most patients; diuretic treatment and supplemental oxygen are indicated in cases of fluid retention and hypoxemia, respectively. High doses of calcium-channel blockers are indicated only in the minority of patients who respond to acute vasoreactivity testing. Nonresponders to acute vasoreactivity testing or responders who remain in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III, should be considered candidates for treatment with either an oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor or an oral endothelin-receptor antagonist. Continuous intravenous administration of epoprostenol remains the treatment of choice in WHO functional class IV patients. Combination therapy is recommended for patients treated with PAH monotherapy who remain in WHO functional class III. Atrial septostomy and lung transplantation are indicated for refractory patients or where medical treatment is unavailable.

U. Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy
U1. Lower the oxygen concentration if the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation is above the target range or if it has been in the upper zone of the target range for some time (usually 4–8 hours) (grade D).
U2. If the target saturation is maintained, the new delivery system and flow should be continued. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required. If the patient is stable, the process can be repeated and the patient can eventually be weaned off oxygen (see section 12) (grade D).
U3. Most stable convalescent patients will eventually be stepped down to 2 L/min via nasal cannulae prior to cessation of oxygen therapy. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure may be stepped down to 1 L/min (or occasionally 0.5 L/min) via nasal cannulae or a 24% Venturi mask at 2 L/min as the lowest oxygen concentration prior to cessation of oxygen therapy (grade D).
U4. Oxygen therapy should be stopped once a patient is clinically stable on low-concentration oxygen, and the oxygen saturation is within the desired range on two consecutive observations (but the prescription for a target saturation range should remain active in case of future deterioration). It may be appropriate to alter the target range following senior review in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease who either have saturations < 94% when stable or in whom it is deemed sensible to discharge from hospital with saturations < 94% pending an outpatient oxygen assessment. Oxygen should also be stopped if the patient has come to the end of a written protocol of timed oxygen (eg, postoperatively) (grade D).
U5. Oxygen saturation on air should be monitored for 5 min after stopping oxygen therapy. If it remains in the desired range, it should be rechecked at 1 hour (grade D).
U6. If the oxygen saturation and physiological 'track and trigger' score (eg, NEWS) is satisfactory at 1 hour, the patient has safely discontinued oxygen therapy. However, saturation and physiology should continue to be monitored on a regular basis according to the patient's underlying clinical condition (grade D).
U7. If the saturation falls below the patient's target range on stopping oxygen therapy, restart the lowest concentration that maintained the patient in the target range and monitor for 5 min. If this restores the saturation into the target range, continue oxygen therapy at this level and attempt discontinuation of oxygen therapy again at a later date provided the patient remains clinically stable (grade D).
U8. If a patient requires oxygen therapy to be restarted at a higher concentration than before to maintain the same target saturation range, the patient should have a clinical review to establish the cause for this deterioration (grade D).
U9. Some patients may have episodic hypoxaemia (eg, after minor exertion or due to mucus plugging) after they have safely discontinued oxygen therapy. An on-going prescription for a target saturation range will allow these patients to receive oxygen as the need arises but transient asymptomatic desaturation does not require correction (grade D).

COPD — evidence on supplemental oxygen for isolated exercise hypoxemia indicates limited benefit: The Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial enrolled 738 patients with mean age above 68 years, and Sixty-five percent of participants desaturated to less than 88% during a six-minute walk test (6MWT); More than 60% of the participants had FEV1 less than 50% predicted. In the patients with moderate exercise-induced hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen was only given during exercise. In a time-to-event analysis, the study did not show significant reduction in time-to-death or first hospitalization. The supplemental oxygen did not provide sustained meaningful improvement in other outcomes including QoL measures. A meta-analysis of seven trials did not report improvements in dyspnea or functional capacity. Another meta-analysis showed that QoL and exercise capacity did not differ after six weeks of supplemental oxygen compared to compressed air, though fatigue and dyspnea domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire improved with supplemental oxygen. Four trials comparing supplemental oxygen with air found exercise capacity and mortality did not differ although shortness of breath after a 6MWT was less in the oxygen group. A crossover RCT with 29 subjects using 28% and 35% FiO2 reported that acute, one-time oxygen administration did not affect the dyspnea scale, limb fatigue, or duration of constant load exercise.

### World Health Organization group III pulmonary hypertension [^22f32ac9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension in the setting of parenchymal lung disease and conditions associated with chronic hypoxemia is commonly encountered in clinical practice and may adversely affect patients' function and mortality. Diagnosis of this subgroup of pulmonary hypertension has evolved but still requires right heart catheterization for confirmation. The primary treatment goal is optimization of the underlying parenchymal lung or hypoxemia-associated condition prior to consideration of pharmacologic therapy. Limited published experience with pulmonary hypertension-specific medications for treatment of WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension suggests symptomatic and functional benefit in selected individuals. The potential for worsening ventilation-perfusion matching must be considered in these cases, however, since there is a paucity of data regarding the optimal approach to treatment selection. Ongoing medication trials and further investigation of mechanisms of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction provide hope for these patients who in the past often had only lung transplantation as a potential treatment option.

Pulmonary hypertension of sickle cell disease — associated conditions and supportive care: Standard care is described as similar to other forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Hypoxemia is treated with supplemental oxygen "to maintain an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of at least 90% at rest, with exertion, and during sleep". Proteinuria and microalbuminuria "may improve with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors". Suspected obstructive sleep apnea is evaluated "via polysomnography and treated accordingly", and in a small pediatric series, treating obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal hypoxemia, and asthma "reduced the elevated TRV". Diuretics are used for "right ventricular volume overload", but must be administered carefully "to minimize the risk of volume depletion–induced erythrocyte sickling", a risk that "may be reduced by HU or chronic transfusions with concomitant treatment for iron overload".

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with adult congenital heart disease (CHD) — risk assessment and treatment recommendations include: Risk assessment is recommended for patients with persistent PAH after defect closure and risk assessment should be considered in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. Bosentan is recommended in symptomatic patients with Eisenmenger syndrome to improve exercise capacity. In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, the use of supplemental oxygen therapy should be considered in cases where it consistently increases arterial oxygen saturation and reduces symptoms, and supplemental iron treatment should be considered in patients with iron deficiency. In patients with adult CHD, including Eisenmenger syndrome, other ERAs, PDE5is, riociguat, prostacyclin analogues, and prostacyclin receptor agonists should be considered. In patients with PAH after corrected adult CHD, initial oral combination therapy with drugs approved for PAH should be considered for patients at low and intermediate risk, while initial combination therapy including i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues should be considered for patients at high risk. In patients with adult CHD, including Eisenmenger syndrome, sequential combination therapy should be considered if patients do not meet treatment goals. In the absence of significant haemoptysis, oral anticoagulant treatment may be considered in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with pulmonary artery thrombosis. In women with Eisenmenger syndrome, pregnancy is not recommended, and in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, routine phlebotomy to lower elevated haematocrit is not recommended.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^d94abd3d]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Intraoperative considerations in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients emphasize that the overarching goals in PH patients receiving anesthesia are to support right ventricular (RV) function by maintaining adequate preload and preventing increases in RV afterload or reduced contractility that may precipitate acute right ventricular failure (RVF). One of the most important fundamental goals is to avoid systemic arterial hypotension that can promote RV ischemia in the setting of a pressure and volume overloaded RV with altered right coronary artery perfusion. Regardless of anesthetic technique and agents, appropriate use of supplemental oxygen (a potent pulmonary vasodilator) should be used to avoid hypoxemia, intravenous lines and syringes must be meticulously deaired to prevent even small amounts of air embolism, and warming blankets, heat and moisture exchangers in the breathing circuit, and warmed IV fluids can help prevent hypothermia which can inhibit physiologic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and ventilation-perfusion mismatching. Additionally, if significant postoperative pain is anticipated, consideration should be given to insertion of an epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia administration to mitigate the deleterious effects of systemic opioid use.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for evaluation of the patient with congenital heart disease–pulmonary arterial hypertension (Class I, Level of Evidence: C) specify that care of adult patients with CHD-related PAH should be performed in centers that have shared expertise and training in both ACHD and PAH; the evaluation of all ACHD patients with suspected PAH should include noninvasive assessment of cardiovascular anatomy and potential shunting with pulse oximetry with and without supplemental oxygen, chest x-ray, ECG, diagnostic cardiovascular imaging via TTE, TEE, MRI, or CT, and complete blood count and nuclear lung scintigraphy; if PAH is identified but its causes are not fully recognized, additional testing should include pulmonary function tests with volumes and diffusion capacity, pulmonary embolism–protocol CT with parenchymal lung windows, additional testing to rule out contributing causes, and cardiac catheterization at least once with potential for vasodilator testing or anatomic intervention at a center with expertise in catheterization, PAH, and management of CHD-PAH; Class IIa guidance states it is reasonable to include a 6-minute walk test or similar nonmaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test as part of the functional assessment of patients with CAD-PAH.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) — cyanosis assessment and closure considerations emphasize accurate peripheral saturation measurement and careful hemodynamic evaluation. Because cyanosis from right-to-left shunting may occur distal to the ductal insertion, accurate assessment of oxygen saturation by oximetry and assessment of cyanosis should be done in the feet and both hands, and pulse oximetry with ambulation as well as at rest may identify patients with increased pulmonary arterial resistance and dynamic shunt reversal; a subset with resting systemic oxygen saturation > 90% may decrease with activity to < 90%, supporting resting and ambulatory pulse oximetry assessment. Invasive hemodynamic assessment still has an important role as a confirmatory tool and for the evaluation of pulmonary vasoreactivity. When signs of volume overload indicate significant left-to-right shunt, closing the PDA is likely to prevent further chamber enlargement, progression or development of pulmonary hypertension, and possibly provide symptom relief; closure is typically performed percutaneously with good success and minimal complications, whereas surgical closure can be performed but is potentially hazardous in adults because of calcification and tissue fragility. Even with elevated pulmonary pressure and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, closure of a PDA may improve clinical status in some patients with persistent left-to-right shunting and prevent further progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension; consultation with adult congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension providers is important, and morbidity and mortality are high when closure is attempted in Eisenmenger physiology with elevated pulmonary pressure and net right-to-left shunting.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to treat a 15-year-old patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory failure [^5ce515ff]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Summary

A 15-year-old female patient with a history of morbid obesity (body mass index of 56), hypertension, hypothyroidism, prediabetes, and asthma presented to an affiliated institution with cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. On presentation to the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was 55% on room air and increased to 88% on 15 L/min non-rebreather. Due to her severe hypoxic respiratory failure, she was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her requirements escalated, necessitating transfer to our institution for higher level of care. On arrival, she had an arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction ratio of 55, consistent with a diagnosis of severe ARDS. Her confirmatory nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test was positive for COVID-19, and chest radiograph revealed pathognomonic bilateral pulmonary parenchymal opacities (Figure 1). She was initiated on intravenous antibiotics, dexamethasone, enoxaparin anticoagulation, inhaled nitric oxide (40 ppm), and placed in a prone position. Convalescent plasma therapy and intravenous remdesivir (Gilead Sciences Inc, Oceanside, Calif) were also administered. She developed acute oliguric renal injury and diastolic hypotension requiring low-dose norepinephrine infusion. Remdesivir was discontinued, given the deterioration in renal function. The ECMO team was consulted for persistent arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction ratio < 80 for several hours. Following multidisciplinary evaluation, she was deemed a candidate for VV-ECMO as a bridge to recovery.

Certainty of evidence and risk of bias assessment

According to GRADE methodology, the certainty of evidence was moderate. Regarding the risk of bias, 78% of the studies had a low risk of bias in the items random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting; 56% in blinding of outcome data, and 44% in other biases (online supplemental figure S2). The funnel plot asymmetry test was not significant, suggesting no publication bias.

Oxygenation measurements

PaO 2 or SpO 2 were used to report oxygenation. Baseline PaO 2 was reported in four studies, three of which reported a mean PaO 2 greater than 60 mm Hgand only one less than 60 mm Hg. As for baseline SpO 2, it was reported in six studies, and in all of them, mean value was greater than 90%. Resting PaO 2 at the end of the trial, reported in five studies, in the intervention group (IG) was similar to that in the control group (MD 0.8 mm Hg; 95% CI −2.9 to 4.5 mm Hg; p = 0.67, I² = 15%) (online supplemental figure S3). Similarly, resting SpO 2 at the trial end, that was reported in four studies, did not differ between the intervention and placebo arms (MD 0.1%; 95% CI −0.9% to 0.6%; p = 0.70, I² = 0%) (online supplemental figure S4). No differences between the intervention and the control groups were shown in sub-analyses based on the disease (COPD or ILD), type of drug and treatment duration. The two studies that could not be meta-analysed reported no significant differences in postintervention oxygenation.

### Outpatient inhaled nitric oxide in a patient with vasoreactive idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and COVID-19 infection [^8b0b1a31]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Case

A 34-year-old female with vasoreactive iPAH (Table 1), who was historically stable on nifedipine (60 mg extended release daily), tadalafil, and macitentan, presented through a telehealth visit with progressive dyspnea and fatigue in the setting of a recent positive COVID-19 PCR test. The patient reported a recent 2-week trip to Egypt, including a Nile cruise, flying round-trip from the United States through Germany to Egypt. Upon her return, the patient initially noticed onset of anosmia followed by a low-grade fever for which she sought medical care. Five days later, she was contacted by the county health authority, advised of the positive test result, and asked to self-quarantine. On the same day, she contacted her PAH care center and was immediately evaluated.

Table 1.
Clinical Characteristics at Diagnosis and at the Last Follow-up Appointment

On the initial telehealth assessment, the patient was noted to be more than 350 miles away and reporting World Health Organization III symptoms, with significant fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. She was tolerating her routine PAH medications and denied having any active chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or lower-extremity edema. Her vital signs included a temperature of 98.9°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 88/57 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp O 2) of 97% on room air. We made a diagnosis of COVID-19 respiratory infection with potential PAH exacerbation and advised on supportive therapy. The patient expressed a desire to avoid hospitalization based on personal and public health concerns (e.g. risk of contagion and use of resources). A home-based telehealth care plan was activated with a twice-daily remote check-in for evaluation of heart failure symptoms and vital signs. With the help of her nonclinician caregiver, the patient performed routine monitoring of vitals and Sp O 2, and twice daily 6-minute-walk tests. She also completed a daily EmPHasis-10 report, which is a validated health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. With the assistance of a local tertiary care academic medical center, a proactive backup evaluation and hospitalization plan was established.
