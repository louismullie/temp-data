## Question

Could be related to pelvic congestion syndrome.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a given presentation could be related to pelvic congestion syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and epidemiology of pelvic congestion syndrome. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and anatomic contributors, including reflux and compression. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and the principle of exclusion. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including imaging thresholds and when to use venography. Finally, I will consider treatment options, expected outcomes, and limitations of evidence, and then synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. Pelvic congestion syndrome, now encompassed within pelvic venous disorders, typically presents as chronic, noncyclic pelvic pain lasting more than 6 months, often in multiparous, premenopausal women, with pain worsened by prolonged standing, fatigue, and during or after intercourse; associated features include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, postcoital ache, bladder irritability, and sometimes vulvar or perineal varicosities or lower-extremity varices, and the prevalence among women with chronic pelvic pain is commonly cited around 12% to 33% [^a2de2655] [^9067eb23] [^610c5511].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the pathophysiology. The dominant mechanism is venous insufficiency with ovarian and/or internal iliac vein reflux, often compounded by mechanical obstruction such as nutcracker syndrome compressing the left renal vein or May-Thurner compression of the left common iliac vein, leading to venous hypertension, dilated pelvic varicosities, and pain; importantly, dilated veins can be seen in asymptomatic women, so symptoms must be correlated carefully with imaging and clinical context [^86e118e0] [^656db304] [^5e416997].

> I need to ensure we keep the differential broad and exclude other causes. Chronic pelvic pain is multifactorial, and PCS is a diagnosis of exclusion; gynecologic etiologies like endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, and chronic PID, as well as urologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial contributors, must be considered and ruled out before attributing pain to venous causes, which is emphasized by gynecologic and vascular guidelines alike [^dc963ef6] [^4d7b3e7b] [^d1a2c7b1].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and imaging thresholds. Let me think about first-line imaging: duplex ultrasound, particularly transvaginal with Doppler, is recommended to identify dilated pelvic veins and reflux; an ovarian vein diameter greater than about 6 mm and slow or reversed flow with Valsalva are supportive, though operator dependence is a limitation; MRI or CT venography can depict tortuous parauterine veins and ovarian vein dilation, with typical thresholds of four or more tortuous parauterine veins, at least one greater than 4 mm, or an ovarian vein greater than 8 mm; however, I should double-check that imaging alone is insufficient without compatible symptoms, and indeed guidelines caution against diagnosing PCS on CT/MRI unless clinical criteria are met [^ab507e9b] [^82d8aa9d] [^86e118e0] [^9e2eaab9] [^87c7a883].

> Wait, let me verify the role of venography. Catheter venography remains the gold standard when intervention is planned or when noninvasive studies are inconclusive; it allows direct visualization of reflux, venous dilation, contrast retention, and collateral pathways, and is typically performed immediately before embolization if indicated; I initially thought venography might be first-line, but that would be misleading — noninvasive imaging should precede invasive confirmation unless intervention is already planned [^82d8aa9d] [^86e118e0] [^a2de2655].

> I will now examine treatment options and expected outcomes. Conservative measures such as NSAIDs, micronized flavonoids, hormonal suppression, pelvic floor therapy, and compression may help some patients, but durable benefit is limited; endovascular embolization of refluxing ovarian and internal iliac tributaries has become the preferred therapy in appropriately selected patients, with technical success around 96% to 100% and clinical improvement in roughly 70% to 90% across series; recurrence can occur via collateral pathways, and some patients require staged or repeat procedures; surgical ligation is reserved for cases where endovascular therapy is unavailable or has failed [^8af5385d] [^1739c9a3] [^975e47e5] [^cc39943a] [^5d14abf7].

> But wait, what if there is venous outflow obstruction rather than isolated reflux. I should confirm that in suspected nutcracker or May-Thurner physiology, treating the obstruction with stenting or bypass can be decisive; case series and reviews show that relieving the compressive lesion can resolve pelvic pain and dyspareunia even when ovarian vein reflux is not directly addressed, underscoring the need to evaluate for upstream obstruction before embolization alone [^a4351187] [^601c116f] [^752e4fbf].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and limitations. Much of the literature consists of retrospective case series and nonrandomized studies; a Cochrane review of surgical interventions for chronic pelvic pain included only limited low-certainty data and did not directly address embolization, and contemporary expert reviews emphasize the need for standardized diagnostic criteria, patient selection, and prospective randomized trials; nonetheless, multiple systematic reviews and large series consistently report meaningful symptom improvement after embolization, supporting its clinical utility while acknowledging the evidence quality [^890874d0] [^88657c64] [^1eff6ab5] [^394b1d4a].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check each step against guidelines. If the patient has chronic, noncyclic pelvic pain with positional worsening and dyspareunia, especially in a multiparous, premenopausal woman, PCS enters the differential; proceed to exclude other common causes of chronic pelvic pain with history, exam, and targeted labs or studies as indicated; use duplex ultrasound as first-line venous imaging to assess for reflux and dilated veins; if noninvasive imaging is inconclusive or intervention is planned, proceed to venography; if venous obstruction is suspected, evaluate for nutcracker or May-Thurner and treat the compressive lesion first; if isolated reflux is confirmed and symptoms persist despite conservative therapy, offer embolization with counseling about expected outcomes and recurrence risks; follow clinically and with ultrasound to monitor for recurrence or new collaterals [^4d7b3e7b] [^ab507e9b] [^82d8aa9d] [^8af5385d].

> In conclusion, yes, chronic pelvic pain with positional exacerbation, dyspareunia, and compatible imaging findings could be related to pelvic congestion syndrome, but I need to ensure we do not anchor prematurely; PCS is a plausible venous contributor after other etiologies are reasonably excluded, and a structured, guideline-concordant workup with noninvasive imaging followed by selective venography and, when appropriate, endovascular therapy offers the best chance of symptom relief while aligning with current evidence and practice standards [^dc963ef6] [^4d7b3e7b] [^86e118e0].

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a **venous disorder** causing chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and postcoital ache, most often in multiparous women of reproductive age [^9067eb23]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus imaging** [^9e2eaab9] — transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler is first-line [^ab507e9b], with MRI/CT or venography reserved for inconclusive cases or when intervention is planned [^82d8aa9d] [^a5e303f8]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with conservative measures (NSAIDs, hormonal therapy, compression) for mild symptoms and endovascular embolization as the preferred definitive therapy for refractory cases, achieving 70–90% symptom relief [^8af5385d] [^975e47e5]. PCS is underrecognized and often misattributed to gynecologic causes, so a high index of suspicion and structured imaging are essential to avoid delays in care [^dc963ef6] [^a2de2655].

---

## Pathophysiology

PCS arises from **venous insufficiency** of the ovarian and internal iliac veins, with reflux and dilation of pelvic varicosities causing congestion and pain [^86e118e0]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Valvular incompetence**: Loss of venous valves leads to retrograde flow and venous hypertension [^5acce419].
- **Hormonal influence**: Estrogen weakens vein walls, explaining the predominance in reproductive-age women [^c8814f54].
- **Mechanical compression**: Nutcracker or May-Thurner syndromes can obstruct venous outflow, worsening reflux [^5e416997].

---

## Clinical presentation

PCS typically presents with **chronic pelvic pain** and associated symptoms:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Chronic pelvic pain (> 6 months) | 100% |
| Dyspareunia (painful intercourse) | 71% |
| Postcoital ache | 65% |
| Dysmenorrhea | 66% |
| Bladder irritability (urgency, frequency) | Common |
| Vulvar/perineal varicosities | 14–80% |
| Lower limb varicosities | 20–50% |

---

Pain is typically **worse premenstrually**, with prolonged standing, and after intercourse; it often improves with supine rest [^9067eb23].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and imaging modalities

Diagnosis is **clinical plus imaging**, with exclusion of other causes of chronic pelvic pain [^4d7b3e7b]:

- **Clinical criteria**: Chronic pelvic pain > 6 months, dyspareunia, postcoital ache, and pelvic varicosities on exam [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler is first-line [^ab507e9b]; MRI/CT or venography are used when ultrasound is inconclusive or intervention is planned [^82d8aa9d] [^a5e303f8].
- **Imaging findings**: Dilated ovarian/pelvic veins (> 6 mm), slow/reversed flow, and venous reflux [^82d8aa9d] [^e7af399d].

---

## Differential diagnosis

PCS must be **differentiated from** other causes of chronic pelvic pain, including:

- **Gynecologic**: endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, chronic PID [^a656492c].
- **Gastrointestinal**: IBS, IBD, adhesions [^notfound].
- **Urologic**: interstitial cystitis, urethral syndrome [^notfound].
- **Musculoskeletal**: pelvic floor dysfunction, myofascial pain [^dc963ef6].

---

## Treatment options

Management is **tailored to symptom severity** and patient preference:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative therapy (NSAIDs, hormonal therapy, compression) | Mild symptoms | 30–50% improvement |
| Endovascular embolization (coils, plugs, sclerotherapy) | Refractory symptoms | 70–90% symptom relief [^8af5385d] [^975e47e5] |
| Surgical ligation | Failed or unavailable embolization | 75% improvement [^cc39943a] |

---

Endovascular embolization is the **preferred definitive therapy**, with high technical success and low complication rates [^8af5385d] [^1739c9a3].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with treatment; recurrence occurs in 10–20% and is often due to incomplete embolization or collateral reflux [^b553d1e5]. Repeat embolization or alternative interventions can manage recurrences [^690e21fc].

---

## Controversies and challenges

PCS remains **controversial** due to:

- **Diagnostic variability**: Lack of standardized criteria and heterogeneity in imaging protocols [^4a12691f].
- **Evidence quality**: Most data are from retrospective series; randomized trials are limited [^88657c64].
- **Underrecognition**: Often misdiagnosed as gynecologic disease, delaying appropriate care [^dc963ef6].

---

Pelvic congestion syndrome is a **venous cause of chronic pelvic pain** in women, defined by reflux and dilation of pelvic veins. It requires clinical suspicion plus imaging for diagnosis, and endovascular embolization offers durable symptom relief in most patients.

Pelvic congestion syndrome is associated with pelvic varicosities that result in chronic pelvic pain, especially in the setting of prolonged standing, coitus, menstruation, and pregnancy. Although the underlying pathophysiology of pelvic congestion syndrome is unclear, it probably results from a combination of dysfunctional venous valves, retrograde blood flow, venous hypertension, and dilatation. Asymptomatic women may also have pelvic varicosities, making pelvic congestion syndrome difficult to diagnose. This article explores the etiologies of pain, use of imaging techniques, and clinical management of pelvic congestion syndrome. Possible explanations for the spectrum of pain among women with pelvic varicosities are also discussed.

### Diagnosis and management of pelvic venous disorders: expert panel narrative review [^394b1d4a]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVD), previously known by various imprecise terms including pelvic congestion syndrome, have historically been underdiagnosed as a cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP), a significant health problem associated with reduced quality of life. However, progress in the field has helped to provide heightened clarity with respect to definitions relating to PeVD, and evolution in algorithms for PeVD workup and treatment has been accompanied by new insights into the causes of a pelvic venous reservoir and associated symptoms. Ovarian and pelvic vein embolization, as well as endovascular stenting of common iliac vein compression, should be considered as management options for PeVD. Both treatments have been shown to be safe and effective for patients with CPP of venous origin, regardless of age. Current therapeutic protocols for PeVD exhibit significant heterogeneity owing to limited prospective randomized data and evolving understanding of the factors driving successful outcomes; forthcoming clinical trials are anticipated to improve understanding of CPP of venous origin as well as algorithms for PeVD management. This Expert Panel Narrative Review provides a contemporary update relating to PeVD, summarizing the entity's current classification, diagnostic workup, endovascular treatments, management of persistent or recurrent symptoms, and future research directions.

### Radiological evaluation of pelvic venous disorders: a comprehensive review [^82c6dc71]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorder (PVD) is a common gynecological disorder caused by chronic pelvic venous congestion. Clinically, it primarily manifests as lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, dyspareunia, increased menstrual flow, and increased vaginal discharge, though positive physical signs are few. The gynecological examination may reveal bilateral ovarian tenderness. The clinical symptoms of PVD are nonspecific and overlap with those of other gynecological conditions, leading to a high rate of missed diagnoses and making accurate diagnoses challenging. The exact etiology of PVD is not fully understood, and there is currently no comprehensive diagnostic standard. Radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of PVD. Through invasive or non-invasive imaging techniques, pelvic lesions can be assessed, providing precise guidance for clinical treatment and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. This review introduces the causes of PVD, the advantages and disadvantages of various non-invasive and invasive imaging examinations, and the key diagnostic points. The aim of this review is to help clinicians and radiologists better understand the disease and improve the accuracy of imaging diagnosis.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^9067eb23]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS) is a common, but underdiagnosed, cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women.

PVCS occurs usually, but not exclusively, in multiparous women. It is characterized by chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease.

The patients present to general practitioners, gynaecologists, vascular specialists, pain specialists, gastroenterologists and psychiatrists. Pain of variable intensity occurs at any time but is worse in the pre-menstrual period, and is exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue. Post coital ache, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, bladder irritability and rectal discomfort are also common. Under-diagnosis of this condition can lead to anxiety and depression.

A multidisciplinary approach in the investigation and management of these women is vital.

Non-invasive imaging (US, CT, MRI) are essential in the diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions that cause CPP as well in the definitive diagnosis of PVCS. Trans-catheter venography remains the gold standard modality for the definitive diagnosis and is undertaken as an immediate precursor to ovarian vein embolization (OVE). Conservative, medical and surgical management strategies have been reported but have been superseded by OVE, which has a reported technical success rates of 96–100%, low complication rates and long-term symptomatic relief in between 70–90% of cases.

The condition, described in this paper as PVCS, is referred to by a wide variety of other terms in the literature, a cause of confusion.

There is a significant body of literature describing the syndrome and the excellent outcomes following OVE however the lack of prospective, multicentre randomized controlled trials for both investigation and management of PVCS is a significant barrier to the complete acceptance of both the existence, investigation and management of the condition.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^36bc9de6]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CPP is a widespread, common and debilitating condition affecting millions of women worldwide. The aetiology is complex and multifactorial. PVCS is a common cause of CPP but is underdiagnosed. Confusion regarding the terminology used to describe the condition has added to this controversy as has the early unwarranted emphasis that is was psychosomatic in nature. The recognition that many of these women demonstrate abnormal pelvic venous vasculature was initially made either at surgery or by venography. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of all causes of CPP including PVCS.

OVE has superseded surgical and medical management of PVCS however the lack of robust multicentre RCTs regarding diagnosis, treatment and outcomes has hindered the complete acceptance by relevant specialists of the existence and significance of this condition. The adoption of the SVP grading system will encourage consistency of terminology, the documentation of all relevant clinical data and the standardization of reporting of outcomes. It is incumbent on all specialists undertaking OVE to engage in collaborative prospective research to enable this group of women to receive the best possible care for their condition.

### Efficacy of endovascular treatment for pelvic congestion syndrome [^1739c9a3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain is not a rare health problem among women. One of the most common causes of chronic pelvic pain is pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). We have reviewed all medical literature on the endovascular treatment of PCS and hereby provide a brief overview of the anatomy, pathophysiology, and clinical aspects of ovarian and pelvic varices. We describe the technique of transcatheter embolization, the complications thereof and the clinical results of the treatment.

Methods

A literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scopus to identify case series on the endovascular treatment of PCS up until the end of November 2014.

Results

Twenty studies with a total of 1081 patients were included in the review. There were no randomized trials, and only one study included a control group. The immediate technical success rate in the occlusion of the affected veins was 99%. Seventeen studies reported the 1- to 3-month clinical success of 641 patients. Of these, 88.1% reported moderate to significant relief in the symptoms and 11.9% reported little or no relief. In 17 studies, long-term results were reported, and the follow-up varied between 7.3 months and 5 years. In late follow-up, 86.6% reported relief of the symptoms and 13.6% experienced little or no relief.

Conclusions

The immediate success rate for the endovascular treatment of PCS is good and the complication rate low. Most patients report relief in the symptoms for up to 5 years after the procedure. However, there are no randomized or high-quality controlled trials, and the level of evidence therefore remains at C.

Laparoscopic trans peritoneal ovarian vein ligation is reported to be associated with symptom improvement in 75% of women. More radical surgery is only indicated in cases of unavailability or failure of less invasive techniques. OVE has reported clinical success in 70–85%, a complication rate of between 3.4–9%, however 6–31.8% of women do not get substantial or long term relief. OVE is currently believed to be the best available treatment but this is based empirical evidence rather than trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the pelvic congestion syndrome [^b8d43e69]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain accounts for up to 30% of outpatient gynecologic visits in the United States, potentially affecting up to 40% of the female population during their lifetime. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is defined as chronic pelvic pain resulting from reflux or obstruction of the gonadal, gluteal, or periuterine veins, sometimes associated with perineal or vulvar varices. It can also be caused by compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, also known as the nutcracker syndrome. Whereas PCS accounts for up to 30% of patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain, it is frequently underdiagnosed. We reviewed the literature to investigate the current state of the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.

Methods

An online database search was performed with MEDLINE. MeSH headings included PCS, chronic pelvic pain, ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, renal vein obstruction, pelvic varicosities, labial varicosities, embolization, treatment, and therapies.

Results

Our MEDLINE search revealed more than 3756 references to chronic pelvic pain. Specific references to PCS, pelvic chronic pain, ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, renal vein obstruction, pelvic varicosities, labial varicosities, embolization, treatment, and therapies, however, included only 260 references. Thirty-seven references were small series including fewer than 50 patients or individual case reports documenting medical, surgical, or endovascular treatment of PCS. The majority of these papers demonstrated successful treatment of symptoms from PCS with embolization of one or both ovarian veins in addition to treatment of refluxing internal iliac vein branches. In addition, open surgery and, more recently, endovascular stenting of LRV obstruction have shown some promise in alleviating symptoms attributed to nutcracker syndrome.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of PCS requires a careful history, physical examination, and noninvasive imaging. Several large case series have demonstrated the efficacy of embolotherapy in the reduction of pelvic pain; thus, it is the most favored treatment option for patients with PCS. For patients with outflow obstruction due to nutcracker syndrome, a limited number of studies have demonstrated remission of symptoms with stenting of the LRV as an alternative to open surgery.

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS)

PCS is a common condition characterised by chronic pelvic pain persisting for more than six months, in the absence of inflammatory disease. It is frequently associated with venous insufficiency and varicosities within the pelvic region.

The prevalence of PCS among patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain ranges from 12% to 33%. PCS predominantly affects premenopausal, multiparous women, who often report chronic pelvic pain accompanied by dysmenorrhoea. These symptoms are typically exacerbated by prolonged standing or during and after sexual intercourse.

Characteristic findings on MRI include tortuous pelvic veins with increased calibre (typically exceeding 5 mm in diameter) and slow-flow phenomena, which are evident on T2-WI and contrast-enhanced sequences (Fig. 4). Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic venous disease, providing high-resolution, real-time visualisation of pelvic venous pathology. It enables precise assessment of venous reflux, dilation, and collateral circulation, playing a key role in both diagnosis and guiding endovascular interventions such as ovarian vein embolisation. However, as an invasive procedure associated with radiation exposure and contrast-related risks, DSA is primarily reserved for patients requiring intervention or those with inconclusive non-invasive imaging findings.

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^dc963ef6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain contributors — Neuromusculoskeletal disorders are described as extremely common and often overlooked, with symptoms that can result from myofascial trigger points or neurovascular entrapment; pain is reproducible on palpation of affected muscle groups and does not typically trigger an autonomic response. Psychosocial factors play a role in all types of pain and are linked to greater prevalence of pelvic pain and dyspareunia in women with a history of abuse, mental illness, lack of support, social stressors, and relationship discord. Pelvic congestion syndrome is presented as a proposed etiology related to pelvic venous insufficiency, but evidence is insufficient to conclude a cause-and-effect relationship, definitions and diagnostic criteria are variable, and further research is needed for consistency and homogeneity.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPostmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain [^809c1471]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pelvic pain is common in both reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and the major etiologies change throughout the life cycle. Chronic pain is defined as lasting for at least 6 months. There are many gastrointestinal and urinary disorders associated with chronic pain in this age group, which are not discussed in this guideline. Pain may be localized to the deep pelvis, with potential causes including pelvic congestion syndrome, intraperitoneal adhesions, hydrosalpinx, chronic inflammatory disease, or cervical stenosis. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, while CT and MRI may be appropriate for further characterization of sonographic findings. Alternatively, pain may be localized to the vagina, vulva, or perineum, with potential causes including vaginal atrophy, vaginismus, vaginal or vulvar cysts, vulvodynia, or pelvic myofascial pain. Imaging is primarily indicated in context of an abnormal physical exam and ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, while MRI may be appropriate for further characterization in select cases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^a656492c]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as 'pain symptoms perceived to originate from the pelvic organs typically lasting more than 6 months. It is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual and emotional consequences as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract, sexual, bowel, pelvic floor, myofascial or gynaecological dysfunction' (Pain).

CPP is estimated to affect 10 million women worldwide, up to 7 million of whom do not seek medical assistance (Perry). It is thought to account for up to 10–20% of all gynaecology outpatient appointments, and is an indication for 20–33% of all diagnostic laparoscopies. CPP has a population prevalence of 15% in women aged 18–50 years, in 61% of cases the aetiology of the pain is unexplained (Perry; Ignacio; Phillips et al; Gynaecological; Mathias et al.).

Causes of CPP include endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, musculoskeletal disorders, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, pelvic venous congestion syndrome and psychological factors.

In 1857 French anatomist and surgeon, Louis Alfred Richet was the first to observe an association between chronic pelvic pain and the presence of varicose veins in the utero-ovarian plexus (Richet). The important association of CPP, broad ligament varicocele and multiparity was made by Lefevre (Lefevre). The demonstration of retrograde filling of the left ovarian vein during renal venography led specialists to consider pelvic varicosities to be analogous to scrotal varicoceles in men (Chidekel).

The presence of lower extremity and vulval varices associated with varices in the pudendal, peri-labial, gluteal and posterolateral thigh regions in women referred with CPP/PVCS is recognised to be important for diagnosis and to determine the most appropriate management strategy (Hobbs).

### Unique case of pelvic congestion syndrome caused by a new communication branch of the portal-vena cava system [^017c1ec2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) often refers to intermittent or persistent pelvic discomfort that lasts for three to six months or longer. The CPP of venous origin is called PCS. In the VEIN-TERM transatlantic interdisciplinary consensus document, PCS is defined as "chronic symptoms produced by ovarian or pelvic venous reflux or obstruction, including pelvic discomfort, perineal heaviness, urine urgency, and painful intercourse". A variety of mechanical and hormonal causes that result in venous dilatation (> 5 mm) and dysfunction may be involved in the varied etiology of PCS.

The OV, also known as the gonadal vein or reproductive vein, originates from the ovaries bilaterally, initially as a trailing plexus of veins that wraps around the ovarian artery and gradually merges into a single vein after leaving the pelvis. The bilateral OVs normally ascend next to the psoas major muscle. While the left OV initially enters the left renal vein at a straight angle and then feeds into the inferior vena cava, the right OV enters the inferior vena cava at an acute angle directly at the level of the right renal vein. Therefore high pressure in the left OV is not conducive to venous blood return and is prone to venous stasis, which is one of the most important causes of ovarian varicose veins. Dilated OVs are seen in 10% of women, of whom up to 60% may develop PCS.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome presenting as persistent genital arousal: a case report [^b84bc49a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Persistent sexual arousal is defined as an intrusive and unwanted genital arousal unrelated to sexual desire and typically unrelieved by one or more orgasms.

Aim

We report a patient presented with persistent sexual or genital arousal.

Methods

A 62-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of persistent genital arousal. The symptoms were unrelated to sexual stimuli but were relieved incompletely and temporarily by orgasm.

Results

Doppler ultrasound demonstrated multiple pelvic varices. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated varices in the pelvis, the vaginal wall, perineum, inguinal region, and anterior abdominal wall. Coil embolization of the dilated incompetent left ovarian vein was performed with marked reduction of symptoms.

Conclusion

We proposed that the syndrome of persistent genital or sexual arousal in women warrants a careful and systematic examination for pelvic venous incompetence by Doppler ultrasound and MRI or computerized tomography, with appropriate tilt positioning and Valsalva maneuver, before assigning it to a central neurologic or psychologic etiology.

### Imaging appearance and nonsurgical management of pelvic venous congestion syndrome [^86e118e0]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS) is a challenging and complex cause of chronic pelvic pain in female patients. PVCS due to incompetent vein valves is the combination of gonadal vein reflux and pelvic venous engorgement in patients with chronic pelvic pain without other causes. However, pelvic venous engorgement and gonadal vein reflux can be seen in patients without pelvic pain, which makes obtaining a detailed history and physical examination important for workup and diagnosis. The underlying cause of PVCS may be incompetent gonadal vein valves or structural causes such as left renal vein compression with an incompetent gonadal vein valve (nutcracker syndrome) or iliac vein compression (May-Thurner configuration) with reflux into the ipsilateral internal iliac vein. Venography is considered the criterion standard for imaging diagnosis; however, more recently, US and MRI have been shown to provide adequate accuracy for diagnosis. Noninvasive imaging studies aid in the diagnosis of PVCS and also aid in pretreatment planning. When PVCS is caused by incompetent gonadal vein valves, treatment typically is performed by means of embolization via a minimally invasive catheter with excellent technical and clinical success rates. When PVCS is caused by venous obstruction, the obstruction must be treated first before gonadal vein embolization and sclerotherapy are considered. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varicosities [^5a126d22]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI), defined as retrograde flow in the gonadal and internal iliac veins, is the underlying cause of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), a common cause of disabling chronic pelvic pain in women of child-bearing age. PCS is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by positional pelvic pain that is worse in the upright position and is associated with pelvic and vulvar varicosities as well as symptoms of dyspareunia and postcoital pain. Through collaterals to the lower extremity venous system, PVI may also contribute to varicose vein formation and recurrence in the lower extremities. Endovascular embolization of the ovarian and internal iliac veins has become the treatment of choice for PVI and PCS. This article reviews the pelvic retroperitoneal venous anatomy, pathophysiology of PCS, treatment options and techniques, and clinical outcomes of embolotherapy for PCS.

Pelvic congestion syndrome treatment options and outcomes — various nonsurgical and surgical approaches are available; pharmacologic agents to suppress ovarian function, such as medroxyprogesterone- or gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may offer short-term pain relief, but their long-term effectiveness has not been proven. Surgical approaches, including hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy and ovarian vein ligation and excision, with interruption of as many collateral veins as possible, have been suggested for patients unresponsive to medical therapy. Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of refluxing ovarian and internal iliac vein tributaries with coils, plugs, or sclerotherapy, usually as combination treatment, has become the standard approach for management of both pelvic congestion syndrome and varices arising from a pelvic source. Transcatheter therapy has been reported to improve symptoms in 50% to 80% of patients. In one randomized study, Chung and Huh randomized 106 premenopausal women with chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to medical treatment to three regimens — ovarian vein embolization; laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and hormone replacement; or laparoscopic hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy — and mean pain scores on a 10-point visual analog scale improved among those undergoing ovarian vein embolization or bilateral oophorectomy but not unilateral oophorectomy, with pain reduction at 12 months greatest after embolotherapy.

### What is the significance of ovarian vein reflux detected by computed tomography in patients with pelvic pain? [^7646efbb]. Clinical Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynecological complaint. CPP is nonmenstrual pain localized in the anatomic pelvis of at least 6 months' duration without any identifiable organic cause that is severe enough to cause functional disability and require treatment. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a poorly understood disorder and often overlooked cause of pelvic pain. Ovarian vein reflux (OVR) and pelvic varicosities are a cause of PCS. On the other hand, OVR can be seen in asymptomatic women, typically parous. OVR has a characteristic appearance at enhanced computed tomography (CT). Contrast medium retrogradely fills the ovarian veins and parauterine veins during the arterial phase after intravenous contrast administration. CT is not the ideal modality to evaluate all the causes of pelvic pain, but CT is a commonly used diagnostic modality to screen patient who presents with abdominal and pelvic pain. CT can demonstrate abnormal ovarian venous flow as well as tortuous and dilated ovarian and pelvic veins. Ovarian vein reflux is important to recognize and when correlated with patient clinical presentation may help in the diagnosis of PCS.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^c0dbd13f]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Different terms have been used interchangeably to describe the entity which these authors refer to as the Pelvic Venous Congestion Syndrome (PVCS). Characterized by chronic pelvic pain and para-metrial tenderness caused by dilatation of the ovarian and/or pelvic veins, PVCS has been described as the chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), female varicocele and pelvic venous congestion (PVC). Pelvic vascular insufficiency (PVI) is used to describe patients where the aetiology of PVCS is incompetent or absent gonadal vein valves.

The varied terminology and continued dispute regarding the existence of pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) has consequences for methods of diagnosis and treatment (Khilnani; Campbell et al.). In an attempt to resolve this controversy, Meissner et al. published The Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology (SVP) classification of pelvic venous disorders (Meissner et al.). This classification, defines three domains Symptoms (S), Varices (V) and Pathophysiology (P). This latter domain encompasses anatomy (A), hemodynamic (H) and aetiologic (E) features, so that an individual's classification is designated SVP AHE. In this classification PeVDs occur in four anatomic zones. The 4 th zone is classified within the internationally recognised CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic physiologic) system which exists for classifying lower extremity venous disorders. This system improves communication diagnosis, management and research (Lurie et al.)although it's utility in the clinical setting and in determining treatment has yet to be determined. The reader is referred to the excellent graphical abstracts for both systems (Meissner et al; Lurie et al.) Fig. 1.

Constitutional, mechanical, inflammatory, hormonal, neural, psychosomatic and vascular aetiologies have all been postulated for PVCS (Hobbs). Anxiety and depression in this group of women has long been recognized with much debate as to whether this cause or effect (Beard et al.). PVCS occurs as a result of primary intrinsic venous abnormalities such as absence of valves and venous incompetence, and secondary to mechanical factors causing venous obstruction including Nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes.

### Transvaginal ultrasound approach for diagnosing pelvic venous disorders [^610c5511]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain, defined as pain that persists for more than six months and does not follow a cyclical pattern, is estimated to affect between 4% and 43% of women. Of these cases, pain of venous origin accounts for approximately 16% to 31% of diagnoses.

Pelvic venous insufficiency is an important but often overlooked condition that contributes significantly to chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. It is also frequently associated with the recurrence of varicose veins in the lower limbs, even among patients who have undergone adequate surgical treatment.

Pelvic pain associated with venous insufficiency, as defined in the VEIN-TERM Transatlantic Interdisciplinary Consensus Document, consists of chronic symptoms that may include pelvic pain, perineal heaviness, urinary urgency, and postcoital pain. These symptoms result from ovarian and/or pelvic vein reflux and/or obstruction that may be associated with vulvar, perineal, and/or lower extremity varicose veins.

The term traditionally applied to clinically describe the presence of pelvic varicose veins associated with chronic pain is pelvic congestion syndrome. However, this terminology does not adequately capture the full spectrum of clinical presentations associated with this pathology. As a result, it has been extensively debated and has largely been replaced by the term pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs). This updated terminology integrates much more broader concepts and adopts a multidisciplinary perspective on venous disorders in this anatomical region, along with a standardization through the Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology classification of PeVDs.

Regarding imaging diagnostic modalities for PeVD, several options are available, including Doppler ultrasound examination, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and phlebography. Among these, phlebography is recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing PeVDs.

### Surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain in women [^890874d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynaecological condition accounting for 20% of all gynaecological referrals. There are wide ranges of causes with overlapping symptomatology, therefore the management of the condition is a formidable challenge for clinicians. The aetiology of CPP is heterogeneous and in many cases, no clear diagnosis can be reached. It is in this scenario that the label of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) can be applied. We defined women with CPPS as having a minimum duration of pain of at least 6 months, including with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome, but excluding pain caused by a condition such as endometriosis. Many surgical interventions have been tried in isolation or in conjunction with non-surgical interventions in the management with variable results. Surgical interventions are invasive and carry operative risks. Surgical interventions must be evaluated for their effectiveness prior to their prevalent use in the management of women with CPPS.

Objectives

To review the effectiveness and safety of surgical interventions in the management of women with CPPS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO, on 23 April 2021 for any randomised controlled trials (RCT) for surgical interventions in women with CPPS. We also searched the citation lists of relevant publications, two trial registries, relevant journals, abstracts, conference proceedings and several key grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

RCTs with women who had CPPS. The review authors were prepared to consider studies of any surgical intervention used for the management of CPPS. Outcome measures were pain rating scales, adverse events, psychological outcomes, quality of life (QoL) measures and requirement for analgesia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion and extracted data using the forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. For each included trial, we collected information regarding the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, data reporting and analyses. We reported pooled results as mean difference (MDs) or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by the Mantel-Haenszel method. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). We applied GRADE criteria to judge the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Four studies met our inclusion criteria involving 216 women with CPP and no identifiable cause. Adhesiolysis compared to no surgery or diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of adhesiolysis on pelvic pain scores postoperatively at three months (MD -7.3, 95% CI -29.9 to 15.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence), six months (MD -14.3, 95% CI -35.9 to 7.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months postsurgery (MD 0.00, 95% CI -4.60; 1 study, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adhesiolysis may improve both the emotional wellbeing (MD 24.90, 95% CI 7.92 to 41.88; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and social support (MD 23.90, 95% CI -1.77 to 49.57; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) components of the Endometriosis Health Profile-30, and both the emotional component (MD 32.30, 95% CI 13.16 to 51.44; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the physical component of the 12-item Short Form (MD 22.90, 95% CI 10.97 to 34.83; 1 study, 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. We are uncertain of the safety of adhesiolysis compared to comparator groups due to low-certainty evidence and lack of structured adverse event reporting. No studies reported on psychological outcomes or requirements for analgesia. Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament ablation or resection compared to diagnostic laparoscopy/other treatment We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic uterosacral ligament/nerve ablation (LUNA) or resection compared to other treatments postoperatively at three months (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.93; 1 study, 51 participants; low-certainty evidence) and six months (MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.38 to 0.18; 1 study, 74 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At 12 months post-surgery, we are uncertain of the effect of LUNA on the rate of successful treatment compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. One study of 56 participants found no difference in the effect of LUNA on non-cyclical pain (P = 0.854) or dyspareunia (P = 0.41); however, there was a difference favouring LUNA on dysmenorrhea (P = 0.045) and dyschezia (P = 0.05). We are also uncertain of the effect of LUNA compared to vaginal uterosacral ligament resection on pelvic pain at 12 months (MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.53; 1 study, 74 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the safety of LUNA or resection compared to comparator groups due to the lack of structured adverse event reporting. Women undergoing LUNA may require more analgesia postoperatively than those undergoing other treatments (P < 0.001; 1 study, 74 participants). No studies reported psychological outcomes or QoL.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the benefit of adhesiolysis or LUNA in management of pain in women with CPPS based on the current literature. There may be a QoL benefit to adhesiolysis in improving both emotional wellbeing and social support, as measured by the validated QoL tools. It was not possible to synthesis evidence on adverse events as these were only reported narratively in some studies, in which none were observed. With the inadequate objective assessment of adverse events, especially long-term adverse events, associated with adhesiolysis or LUNA for CPPS, there is currently little to support these interventions for CPPS.

### Imaging of deep venous pathology [^656db304]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Imaging of Pelvic Venous Disorders

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVD) cover a spectrum of signs and symptoms from the abdomen, pelvis and legs. From an imaging perspective, PeVD are made up from 2 different conditions. The first is venous reflux, causing a hemodynamic shift in the abdomen/pelvis. The second is due to obstruction in the deep veins impeding outflow. The result of either or both these conditions is dilation and dysfunction of the pelvic veins characterized by slow flow and reflux.

Symptoms from PeVD are variable and in fact, superficial varicose veins may occur without any pelvic symptoms and thus may be the only findings in PeVD. The pelvic circulation is highly complex and interrelated, which contributed to misdiagnosis and very variable outcomes in the clinical research published to date. The concept of PeVD, proposed by Meissner et al. centers around the attempts to address the complexity of the problem. A similar degree of venous insufficiency may produce different symptoms, as well as identical symptoms may have different underlying pathophysiology in different patients. It is important to acknowledge that superficial varicose veins may occur without any pelvic pain and be the only symptom of PVI.

Hence PeVD should be regarded as the basket of possible vein changes resulting in chronic (pelvic) complaints, caused by either pelvic venous insufficiency (for example the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS)) and/or Nutcracker Syndrome (NTS)) or variations of the May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) and/or chronic obstruction. The classification proposed by Meissner et al. categorizes these disease entities or patterns based on symptoms (S), varicosities (V) and the underlying pathophysiology (P), referred to as the SVP-classification. The goal of the classification is, in addition to helping clinicians to categorize the (type of) disease, to be able to compare treatment strategies for specific disease entities. The concept facilitates a comparison of similar patterns of symptoms, underlying varicosities and pathophysiologic abnormalities in all aspects of the disease by standardizing the reporting. Examples of the same areas being affected by different pathophysiology are shown in (Fig. 10).

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^752e4fbf]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) refers to a symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV) as it passes either between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta ("classic" or "anterior nutcracker") or posteriorly between the aorta and the spine as an anatomical variant ("posterior nutcracker"). Patients typically exhibit left flank pain, hematuria and proteinuria and may develop secondary gonadal vein insufficiency as a result of collateral formation. The term "nutcracker syndrome" should be limited to symptomatic patients since a physiological tapering of the left renal vein in its aortomesenteric portion can be frequently observed in asymptomatic and, in particular, slender patients. This imaging finding is commonly referred to as "nutcracker phenomenon". NCS poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and uncertainties regarding optimal treatment. In this article, we describe our therapeutic approach for patients with suspected NCS exemplified by four illustrative cases, with a focus on concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Management

Management of PVCS including diagnosis, investigation and treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach involving gynaecologists, vascular surgeons, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, urologists, neurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists (Ignacio; Cordts et al; Osman et al; Drife).

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of PVSC /PVI is based on the clinical history, presentation, and physical examination and imaging investigations. Patients are usually, although not exclusively, pre-menopausal and multiparous. PVCS is characterized by chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease. Pain of variable intensity may be uni- or bilateral but is usually asymmetric, is worse premenstrually, exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue. Post coital ache (65%), dysmenorrhea (66%) and dyspareunia (71%), bladder irritability and rectal discomfort are common (Taylor; Beard; Kuligowska et al.). Under-diagnosis can lead to anxiety and depression (Hobbs). Beard et al. observed that post-coital ache and/or ovarian point tenderness, occurring in 86% of their series, were strong discriminators in favour of PVCS demonstrating 94% sensitivity and 77% specificity (Beard et al; Beard).

Not all women with PVCS have typical pelvic pain, they may present with recurrent lower extremity varicose veins or hip pain (Phillips et al.). A case of persistent genital arousal, an under-recognised and distressing condition, was found to have PVCS which was successfully treated with OVE (Thorne and Stuckey).

Investigations

Investigations include laparoscopy, non-invasive and invasive imaging techniques.

Laparoscopy

Laparoscopy is commonly undertaken in the investigation of women presenting with CPP. Beard et al. found dilated veins and vascular congestion in the broad ligament and ovarian plexus in 91% of women examined laparoscopically for CPP with no other pelvic pathology (Beard et al.). Whilst laparoscopy is excellent for identifying other pelvic pathology that may cause CPP, because the patient is supine and CO 2 is insufflated, varices may be compressed and the diagnosis of PVCS masked in as many as 86–90% of cases (Ignacio).

Clinical outcomes

Pelvic venous embolization is currently widely believed to be the best available treatment for PCS, however this is based on empirical data rather than detailed evidence from clinical trials (Borghi and Dell'Atti).

In an early series, 88.9% of women reported 80% immediate relief of symptoms overall following coil embolization of the ovarian veins and contributing internal iliac tributaries. Individual symptom relief varied from 40–100% at mean follow up of 13.4 months. There were no major complications and by year 2005 centres were reporting technical success rates of 96–99% with few complications and reported rates of symptomatic relief in 75% of patients, with up to 60% experiencing complete resolution of symptoms (Drife; Kuligowska et al.).

A decade after the first report of OVE it was observed that it had become the mainstay of treatment, with technical success reported as 98%-100%. 70–85% patients reported immediate symptom improvement within two weeks with recurrence rates of 8% (Freedman et al; Kim et al.).

In a comprehensive review of the literature in 2018, Champaniera et al. reached the following conclusion: 'The data supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PVI in the presence of CPP are limited and of variable quality, and considerable further high-quality research is required to thoroughly address the research question' (Champaneria et al.). The group also stated 'embolization appears to provide good to complete symptomatic relief in the majority of women'. Regarding outcomes of the 1308 patients included in the analysis 75% reported an early symptom benefit from embolization. In nine studies where pain was measured on follow up using a visual analogue scale (VAS), a statistically significant reduction was seen in all cases (Chung and Huh; Venbrux; Meneses et al; Kim et al; Creton et al; Richardson and Driver; Gandini et al; Tropeano et al; Asciutto et al; Brown). (Table 2).

Current evidence and trends

A large body of literature exists related to PVCS as a cause of CPP and that the initial treatment of choice is OVE. The overwhelming consensus from the systematic reviews that have been undertaken is the need for robust multicentre randomized controlled trails (RCTs).

In 2010, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Technology Assessment Committee urged the adoption of common definitions, approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes to optimize the care of patients with CPP resulting from pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI) (Black et al.). They noted that although trans-catheter embolization had become an established treatment for PVCS, published outcomes were limited by non-standardized reporting, incomplete follow-up and the use of variable outcome measures.

Campbell et al. examined the opinions of vascular surgeons in the UK regarding the treatment of pelvic vein reflux (PVR) associated with varicose veins, 9% of respondents to a questionnaire did not recognize PVR as an entity and 11% do not investigate or treat it (Campbell et al.). The lack of agreement on consistent terminology and the lack of prospective RCTs are cited as two reasons for these opinions.

A multidisciplinary research consensus panel identified certain areas requiring urgent research priorities in pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) in women (Khilnani). They conclude that multiple evidence gaps exist related to PeVDs with the consequence that nonvascular specialists rarely consider the diagnosis. The areas they identified are:
Consensus on the clinical and imaging criteria for PeVD.
A discriminative tool to categorize patients with PeVD.
QOL tools to measure the health burden in women affected by PeVD and its change after treatment.

In the USA, obtaining re-imbursement from insurance companies is challenging some considering OVE for PVI an investigative treatment, this may in part be because original studies over-emphasized the psychological component of the condition (Khilnani; Bookwalter et al.). They conclude that although the evidence for OVE for CPP/PVCS is strong more research is needed especially when PVCS is combined with lower extremity varicosities. Large multicentre prospective RCTs looking at pre and post embolization hormone levels, conception and pregnancy outcomes are required.

### Developing the FIGO-IPPS "R U MOVVING SOMe" classification system for female chronic pelvic pain [^71d02282]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.10 V – Vascular

This category encompasses conditions affecting the blood vessels in the pelvic region. A primary example is pelvic vascular insufficiency (PVI), commonly known as pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), characterized by dilated and tortuous veins in the pelvis that can lead to chronic pain. Although the definition and pathophysiology of PCS/PVI continue to be investigated, increasing evidence supports its association with CPP, and therapeutic non‐evidence‐based interventions are available. This category includes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and other vascular conditions such as vascular compression syndromes (e.g. Nutcracker syndrome, May‐Thurner syndrome) associated with CPP. Pain in these conditions can arise from altered blood flow dynamics, venous engorgement, hypoxia, and increased pressure on surrounding pelvic structures. Including a vascular category in the R U MOVVING SOMe classification system was based on consensus agreement between the stakeholders and the SC.

3.11 I – Idiopathic (no pain contributor identified)

This classification is reserved for instances of persistent pelvic pain where a definitive underlying pathological process or specific etiological factor cannot be identified despite a comprehensive and systematic clinical investigation. This necessitates the utilization of thorough history taking, meticulous physical examination, appropriate imaging techniques (e.g. ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography), and other relevant diagnostic modalities (e.g. laboratory analyses, endoscopic procedures) as clinically indicated. The assignment of the "Idiopathic" category signifies that a condition or reason for the patient's pelvic pain remains elusive based on current medical knowledge and available diagnostic capabilities. Although an idiopathic diagnosis can be a source of frustration for both the individual experiencing pain and the clinicians involved in their care, it is a necessary category that acknowledges the inherent limitations of current medical understanding and diagnostic technologies.

We emphasize that the "Idiopathic" category must not be used in cases where the clinical evaluation is incomplete. Regardless of the accessibility or availability of evaluation resources, this category should only be considered after a rigorous and comprehensive diagnostic workup has been undertaken to exclude identifiable organic pathologies. Prematurely assigning the "Idiopathic" label without a thorough investigation could lead to misclassifying conditions with potentially treatable underlying causes and may hinder the development of appropriate management strategies. Therefore, this category serves as a diagnosis of exclusion, made only after comprehensive efforts to identify a specific etiology have been exhausted.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^a6bc4e28]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal management strategy of nutcracker syndrome is debated, especially in the setting of concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome. In this article, we describe our treatment algorithm as illustrated by four different case scenarios. In our experience, renocaval pressure gradients are often inconclusive, but evaluation of the left renal vein waveform as well as a "test PTA" with evidence of a waist in the balloon can be helpful in unmasking a relevant stenosis. We consider nutcracker syndrome not to be a contraindication for ovarian vein embolization. Decision for simultaneous or sequential stenting should be based on angiographic findings and clinical course.

### Evaluation of effectiveness of embolization in pelvic congestion syndrome with the new vascular occlusion device (artVentive EOS ™): preliminary results [^43c5ca06]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a common cause of chronic lower abdominal/pelvic pain, estimated to affect about 10–15% of women, predominantly between the ages of 30 and 45. PCS is anatomically characterized by the presence of varicose and incompetent parametrial veins. In the majority of patients, PCS manifests with non-cyclic abdominal or pelvic pain lasting for at least half a year. Typically, it is characterized by chronic, dull and continuous discomfort, increasing on prolonged standing during menstruation and after sexual intercourse. Other symptoms include vulvar swelling, lower limb oedema and urinary urgency. Women with PCS are typically premenopausal, and a relationship between PCS and endogenous oestrogen levels has been suggested, since oestrogen is known to weaken vein walls.
In order to evaluate the characteristic set of clinical symptoms, imaging examinations may be useful to differentiate the causes of pain. The preferred imaging study for PCS is transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) with Doppler imaging, which enables dynamic visualisation of the flow in pelvic venous plexus. The unaffected pelvic veins are relatively straight structures with a diameter less than 4 mm. In patients with PCS, ultrasound findings commonly include parametrial venous plexus dilation above 6 mm and slow or reversed blood flow during Valsalva manoeuvre. Important is also to find dilated arcuate veins passing through the uterine muscle. The possibility of oestrogen overstimulation in women with PCS may explain why more than 50% also have cystic ovaries as observed during TVUS.

Another non-invasive imaging technique to assess the pelvic venous outflow is the MRI (Fig. 1). Using a routine FSE T2-weighted sequence with fat saturation is able to evaluate dilated ovarian veins (Fig. 2 a). A volumetric single slab TSE sequence is very useful which enables acquisition of high-resolution 3D datasets (i.e. SPACE). There are also possibly more advanced techniques like time-resolved MR-angiography, which are used for not only detecting but also grading ovarian venous reflux. Unfortunately, all MR techniques are poor in assessing the possible coexisting internal iliac venous incompetence.

### Embolization to treat pelvic congestion syndrome and vulval varicose veins [^5aec0a88]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of embolization for treating the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Methods

Twenty-one women with PCS who were treated with embolization at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre between 2003 and 2008 were sent a questionnaire about their symptoms before embolization, 2 months after the first embolization, and at the time the survey was conducted.

Results

All patients completed the questionnaire. Two months after the first embolization, 14 (66.7%) women had some degree of improvement of symptoms. Nine (42.9%) patients underwent a second embolization. At the time the survey was conducted, 16 (76.2%) patients had some degree of improvement of symptoms. In addition to improvements in varicose veins and pelvic pain, there was improvement of hemorrhoids.

Conclusion

Embolization of pelvic varicosities may be an effective treatment in a well-selected group of patients with PCS. If there is no improvement of symptoms after initial embolization, a second procedure is unlikely to be effective.

### Radiologic findings of pelvic venous congestion in an adolescent girl with angiographic confirmation and interventional treatment [^c9fae796]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

We present a case of pelvic venous congestion in a 13-year-old girl who complained of pelvic pain for 9 months. The diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome was suggested by imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, with classically described imaging findings. The girl underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, where visual inspection demonstrated congested pelvic veins and endometriosis. After removal of endometrial implants, the child's pain persisted and she subsequently underwent venography and embolization of the ovarian veins. We found no literature describing pelvic venous congestion (PVC) in children. Knowledge that PVC exists in children is important, particularly for pediatric radiologists who are imaging patients with complaints of pelvic pain.

### Unique case of recurrent pelvic congestion syndrome treated with median sacral vein embolization [^690e21fc]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is defined as noncyclical pelvic pain or discomfort caused by dilated parauterine, paraovarian, and vaginal veins. PCS is typically characterized by ovarian venous incompetence that may be due to pelvic venous valvular insufficiency, hormonal factors, or mechanical venous obstruction.

Methods

We describe a case of a 38-year-old multiparous female with a history of pelvic pressure, vulvar varices, and dyspareunia. She underwent left gonadal vein coil embolization in 2014 for PCS that lead to symptomatic relief of her pain. Four years later, the patient returned for recurrent symptoms. Magnetic resonance venogram demonstrated dilated pelvic varices. The previously embolized left gonadal vein remained thrombosed, and there was no evidence of right gonadal vein insufficiency. However, catheter-based venography revealed a large, dilated, and incompetent median sacral vein.

Results

Pelvic venography demonstrated left gonadal vein embolization without any evidence of reflux. The right gonadal vein was also nondilated without reflux. Internal iliac venography showed large cross-pelvic collaterals and retrograde flow via a large, dilated median sacral vein. Coil embolization of the median sacral vein resulted in a dramatic reduction of pelvic venous reflux and resolution of symptoms.

Conclusions

Recurrence of PCS can occur after ovarian vein embolization through other tributaries in the venous network. The median sacral vein is a rare cause of PCS. We present an interesting case of a successfully treated recurrent PCS with coil embolization of an incompetent median sacral vein.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^435dd3b5]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

On angiography, reduced opacification of the central portion of the LRV and presence of collaterals are the main visual indicators for nutcracker phenomenon. Sometimes, resistance can be felt upon catheterization of the LRV, indicative of a stenosis. We found that test inflation of an appropriately sized PTA balloon (8–12 mm) with evidence of a waist may also be helpful in unmasking a structural LRV stenosis and differentiating this from a dynamic vascular compression (Figs. 1 and 4).

The therapeutic approach used in our institution for patients with suspicion of NCS or PCS, which is based on the above rationale and builds on previously published algorithms, is presented in Fig. 6. In patients with typical PCS, we do not routinely perform venography of the LRV prior to and after embolization of the left ovarian vein to rule out concurrent NCS. However, as exemplified by the cases presented in this article, suspicion of NCS should be raised if the patient exhibits symptoms not explained by PCS alone (i.e. renal congestion symptoms), if their symptoms change or deteriorate after gonadal vein embolization or if the patient does not match the typical patient population for PCS (e.g. a nulligravidous female). At first, we were hesitant to embolize the left gonadal vein in PCS patients with suspected concurrent NCS, as closing off one of the main collaterals may aggravate congestion in the LRV, exemplified by case 2. However, even in this patient, there was no increase in the renocaval pressure gradient immediately after left ovarian vein embolization. Therefore, gonadal vein embolization is unlikely to cause acute organ-threatening congestion. In borderline cases, it may be prudent to wait and see whether symptoms are spontaneously resolved, since two-staged embolization and stenting can still be done if necessary.

Pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) (i.e., pelvic congestion syndrome) — definition, diagnosis, and treatment: PeVD is a venous insufficiency disorder that primarily affects women, with dilation and dysfunction of ovarian or internal iliac veins resulting in slow blood flow and reflux, and PeVD can be described by the Symptoms‑Varices‑Pathophysiology (SVP) classification. PeVD is often misdiagnosed due to nonspecific symptoms of pelvic pain after prolonged periods of sitting/standing, after intercourse, and after the first days of menstruation, and diagnosing PeVD can be challenging due to symptom overlap with other conditions. Diagnostic procedures include pelvic ultrasound, CT, MRI, or venography, while imaging procedures can present challenges among patients with obesity. Treatment options may include hormonal therapy, nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, and micronized flavonoid fraction; elevation of the legs, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged sitting or standing may help, and other treatments include endovascular embolization to block or close off the affected veins.

### Safety, efficacy, and prognostic factors in endovascular treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome [^a02801b6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter embolization using coils for treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) and to elucidate prognostic factors for clinical success.

Methods

Data were retrospectively analyzed from 113 women with PCS who underwent endovascular embolization of ovarian and pelvic varicose veins at Hospital Clínico Universitario, Zaragoza, Spain between January 2001 and January 2011. Pain score was evaluated before and after the procedure via a visual analog scale (VAS). Associated symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, and lower limb symptoms) were also evaluated. Patients were followed up for 12 months.

Results

The technical and clinical success was 100%. At 12 months, 53% of patients had no pelvic pain and 47% reported a reduction in pelvic pain. The average VAS was 7.34 before the procedure and 0.47 at 12 months. Complete relief of pain and associated symptoms was achieved for 37% of patients. Urinary urgency, lower limb symptoms, and vulvar and lower limbs varicosities were prognostic factors related to incomplete treatment success. The global complication rate was low (5/113, 4.4%).

Conclusion

Transcatheter embolization was a safe and effective treatment for PCS. Lower limb symptoms, urinary urgency, and varicosities were associated with incomplete clinical success.

Computed tomography

Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) is commonly undertaken in the evaluation of women with CPP. A study of the CT and MR appearances of pelvic varices, characterized their appearances as dilated tortuous para uterine tubular structures extending laterally in the broad ligament and reaching the pelvic side wall or extending inferiorly to communicate with the paravaginal venous plexus (Coakley et al.).

The following criteria were suggested for diagnosis of pelvic varices: at least 4 ipsilateral tortuous para-uterine veins of varying calibre at least one with a diameter of > 4 mm or an ovarian vein diameter of > 8 mm (Coakley et al.). CT may be of specific value in identifying the Nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes (Osman et al; Szaflarski et al.) but MR should remain the first line of investigation in this cohort due the patient young age and radiation dose.

### Controversies in treating nutcracker syndrome [^4b902291]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a rare vascular disorder that involves the compression of the left renal vein (LRV), usually between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. It may lead to specific symptoms, including hematuria and flank pain, which can significantly affect a patient's quality of life. In male patients, a varicocele may be noted, whereas in females, pelvic congestion syndrome could be a possible manifestation.

Although NCS is a well-recognized medical condition, diagnosis and treatment remain debatable due to the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, and emerging innovative treatment modalities. One of the primary challenges in the management of NCS is the absence of a universally accepted diagnostic algorithm, resulting in variability of diagnostic criteria, leading to inconsistencies in patient evaluation. Another key controversy lies in determining the most appropriate treatment approach. While conservative management is generally preferred in the pediatric population, invasive treatments, including surgical and endovascular interventions, are considered for more severe cases. However, these interventions present challenges, including procedural risks, long-term complications, and uncertainty regarding material durability, particularly in younger patients. Emerging technologies, such as 3D-printed stents, hold promises for personalized treatment, yet their clinical application remains under investigation.

In terms of persistent uncertainties regarding NCS diagnosis and treatment, this brief communication aims to highlight and summarize the most important controversies in managing anterior NCS. The overview of current controversies underscores the necessity for standardized diagnostic guidelines, a multidisciplinary approach, and further research to optimize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^440abf23]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation and non-invasive imaging

Overall, nutcracker syndrome is a rare entity and remains a diagnosis of exclusion after more common conditions such as urinary tract infections, urolithiasis, nephritis and endometriosis have been ruled out. As such, diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome is challenging and often delayed. Renal venous hypertension typically manifests as left-sided flank pain, hematuria or proteinuria. Secondary gonadal vein insufficiency may lead to pelvic congestion syndrome or left sided varicocele in females and males, respectively. Since the symptoms must be carefully correlated with imaging findings, interventional radiology plays a crucial role in both diagnosis and therapy.

Cross-sectional imaging readily depicts the acute narrowing of the aortomesenteric portion of the LRV, commonly termed "beak sign" on axial slices. The hilar-to-aortomesenteric LRV diameter ratio has been reported to have a specificity of 89–100% for NCS with cutoffs between 4.9–5.0. Further, an aortomesenteric angle < 35–41° on sagittal reformatted images is nearly always present in NCS patients. This is commonly encountered in slender young patients with only little retroperitoneal fat, and it has been argued that this is the reason why NCS may be alleviated by weight gain in adolescents. In our experience, collaterals are usually not readily apparent on CT and MRI, with the exception of the gonadal veins.

Management of NCS can be either conservative and observational in patients with mild hematuria and tolerable symptoms or invasive in case of recurrent gross hematuria, severe symptoms or ineffective conservative treatment. Invasive treatments include open surgical and endovascular interventions. Surgical treatment of anterior NCS consists in the transposition of LRV or left gonadal vein in the inferior vena cava, saphenous vein cuff, or vein patch, while anterior reimplantation of retroaortic LRV into the inferior vena cava is performed in posterior NCS. Finally, endovascular LRV stenting may be considered for the treatment of NCS associated with pelvic congestion.

### The role of iliac vein stent placement in pelvic venous disorder management [^9442b0f9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common clinical complaint, with up to 40% of women in outpatient gynecology clinics seeking care for this condition. Approximately one-third of exploratory gynecologic laparoscopies and one-quarter of hysterectomies are performed for chronic pelvic pain. An estimated 30% of patients with chronic pelvic pain have symptoms attributable to underlying venous dysfunction. For venous-origin chronic pelvic pain, venous reflux and/or obstruction are thought to be significant pain generators. Surgical interventions can be applied to treat pelvic venous disease; however, data suggests endovascular therapies are more effective, with lower morbidity, less residual pain, and lower rates of symptom recurrence. Embolotherapy and stent placement are the mainstay endovascular therapies to address reflux and obstruction, respectively. This paper reviews the role of iliac vein stent placement in the treatment of a subset of patients with pelvic venous disease (PeVD).

There are no universally agreed upon criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of PeVD. Historically, terms such as "May-Thurner syndrome", "Nutcracker syndrome", and "pelvic congestion syndrome" were used to delineate clinical presentations within the PeVD category. These terms problematically frame each pathology as isolated, when there is growing recognition that these conditions are related and can result in overlapping clinical presentations along a spectrum. The lack of uniformity in diagnosis and management has led to skepticism of treatment efficacy outside of the vascular specialist community. Non-venous specialists refer to a lack of data proving a causal relationship between pelvic venous insufficiency and pelvic pain. Downstream negative effects of this skepticism include delays in diagnosis and treatment and lack of complete payor coverage.

The Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology (SVP) instrument was created by a multidisciplinary working group supported by the American Vein and Lymphatic Society (AVLS) to precisely classify pelvic venous disorders within a comprehensive framework. The instrument describes four broad clinical presentations according to anatomic zones — left flank (left renal vein), pelvic (ovarian and iliac vein), pelvic-origin extra-pelvic (genitalia/groin), and lower extremity (Table). The instrument also delineates the varicosities and categorizes underlying pathophysiology of the venous dysfunction (ie, reflux or obstruction). The SVP instrument is intended to be complementary to CEAP classification in patients with lower extremity venous disease.

A further systematic review of 14 studies which examined outcomes of 994 interventions in 828 patients, 979 initial ovarian and iliac interventions (some as staged procedures) were followed by 14 repeat interventions for recurrence failure. Average follow up was 36.1 (1–288) months, clinical improvement was recorded in 68.3–100% of patients (Brown).

A concern with any intervention involving the reproductive system in women is the potential impact on future fertility.

They also noted that there were no differences in pre-and three months post-embolization of LH and FSH levels (p < 0.05) (Liu et al.). Other small case series have reported pregnancies and live births following OVE (Perry; Xu et al; and Yang et al.). OVE has not demonstrated any hindrance or reduction in female reproductive ability.

Discussion

Recognition of PeVD has increased, yet the use of outdated terms — such as nutcracker syndrome and pelvic congestion syndrome — can oversimplify the condition and complicate our understanding and management. PeVD can present with symptoms like left flank pain, hematuria, CPP, and signs of CVD, including lower limb edema, aching, venous claudication, and vulvar or pelvic varicose veins. These symptoms often overlap with conditions such as recurrent varicose veins, hemorrhoids, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder and bowel syndromes, endometriosis, and chronic low back pain, potentially leading to underdiagnosis and ineffective treatments.

CPP affects approximately 24% of premenopausal women and is a common reason for gynecological consultations. A case-control study found a strong association between CPP and PeVD, with pelvic vein incompetence in 62% of women with CPP vs 19% of controls (odds ratio, 6.79; 95% confidence interval, 4.11–11.47). Another study reported that women with PeVD experienced higher rates of CPP and reduced health status compared to controls. The prevalence of dilated pelvic veins — a hallmark of PeVD — was 12% among women undergoing imaging, higher in premenopausal (21%) than postmenopausal women (10%), with 18% of those having dilated veins also presenting CPP. In our study, CPP was a key inclusion criterion, with all patients presenting signs or symptoms of CPP or symptomatic varicocele. Notably, 35 women (44.9%) with CVD undergoing iliac vein stenting did not spontaneously report CPP during history taking, despite prior treatments for endometriosis or hysterectomy. Establishing a link between pelvic symptoms and vascular causes remains challenging for both patients and clinicians.

### Effectiveness of embolization or sclerotherapy of pelvic veins for reducing chronic pelvic pain: a systematic review [^88657c64]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in the presence of dilated and refluxing pelvic veins is often described as pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), although the causal relationship between pelvic vein incompetence and CPP has not been established. Percutaneous embolization is the principal treatment for PCS, with high success rates cited. This study was undertaken to systematically and critically review the effectiveness of embolization of incompetent pelvic veins.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive search strategy encompassing various terms for pelvic congestion, pelvic pain, and embolization was deployed in 17 bibliographic databases, with no restriction on study design. Methodologic quality was assessed. The quality and heterogeneity generally precluded meta-analysis. Results were tabulated and described narratively.

Results

Twenty-one prospective case series and one poor-quality randomized trial of embolization (involving a total of 1,308 women) were identified. Early substantial relief from pain was observed in approximately 75% of women undergoing embolization, and generally increased over time and was sustained. Significant pain reductions following treatment were observed in all studies that measured pain on a visual analog scale. Repeat intervention rates were generally low. There were few data on the impact on menstruation, ovarian reserve, or fertility, but no concerns were noted. Transient pain was common following foam embolization, and there was a < 2% risk of coil migration.

Conclusions

Embolization appears to provide symptomatic relief of CPP in the majority of women and is safe, although the quality of the evidence is low.

### Female pelvic vein embolization: indications, techniques, and outcomes [^7c4d92f2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

For over 20 years, pelvic vein embolization (PVE) and most commonly ovarian vein embolization, has been performed principally for pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVC). Evidence remains poor for its efficacy, and although initially anecdotal by way of case reports and small series, data is accumulating in larger series. There remains, however, a lack of robust evidence of its effectiveness, and this partly reflects the challenges of actually making the diagnosis clinically and radiologically, as well as the difficulty in assessing outcome. For PVC, symptomatic response is usually subjective but visual analogue scales (or variations thereof) have most often been used to attempt to identify a more objective outcome.

It may be argued that PVE is an established procedure that has been awaiting a significant clinical problem, and most interventional radiology suites do not perform the procedure in significant numbers. Increasingly, however, and over the last 10 years, more and more patients are being referred for the PVE, by vascular surgeons and other phlebologists, with pelvic venous reflux communicating with lower limb varicosities, and felt to be a significant or indeed the only cause of these veins.

Lower limb varicosities are typically associated with variable incompetence of the greater and lesser saphenous veins occasionally with perforating vein dysfunction.

Although surgery is effective in eliminating or reducing lower limb varicose veins, recurrent varices after surgery (REVAS) ranges between 20% and 80% of patients between 5 and 20 years after initial surgery, depending on the definition of recurrence.

The commonest explanation of varicose vein recurrence in the lower limbs is neovascularization. However, a more likely explanation is the development of collateral veins between the pelvis and lower limbs. Indeed, this is supported by growing evidence that primary or adjunctive treatment by PVE allows for the successful treatment of symptomatic lower limb venous recurrences. Such a collateral network of veins has previously been described and may be demonstrated by catheter venography with incompetence confirmed by 'functional' duplex sonography. It has also been reported that no more than 45% of these recurrences occur in the region of the greater saphenous vein suggesting reflux from pelvic veins as the cause.

### Female pelvic vein embolization: indications, techniques, and outcomes [^ce5165ec]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian and other pelvic varices (such as in the distribution of the internal iliac veins) are not an infrequent finding in adult women, and particularly those who have previously had at least one pregnancy associated with a vaginal delivery or at least a significant trial of labour. However, they are also well described in asymptomatic parous women.

Traditionally, such varices were diagnosed directly on clinical examination of vulval or perivulvar areas, or indirectly from a symptomatic history supporting the clinical diagnosis of 'pelvic venous congestion syndrome'. However, more recently, it has become apparent that most of these varicosities can only be demonstrated adequately with non-invasive or minimally invasive imaging techniques. Some centres regard catheter venography as the optimum and others, transvaginal or transperineal duplex ultrasound scanning. In the author's experience, transvaginal Doppler has not been widely adopted as it is very much operator dependent and difficult to reproduce and validate, and thus confined to a very few specialist centres. In contrast, venography is widely available, more objectively comparable, and has been used to 'confirm' refluxing pelvic veins suggested on a leg vein Doppler mapping study.

Pelvic venous incompetence is usually the underlying aetiology in the causation of pelvic varices and has been well known to be manifest as pelvic venous congestion syndrome and usually reflects damage of pelvic vein valves during parturition, but it also rarely results from congenital venous stenosis or webs such as in May–Thurner syndrome, or acquired venous stenosis perhaps associated with iatrogenic or other trauma, tumour or deep venous thrombosis. This well-recognized but poorly understood condition presents with a spectrum of symptoms including non-cyclic pelvic and sometimes abdominal pain for greater than six months duration, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, haemorrhoids, bladder irritability, and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome although there are several others. However, the diagnosis can only be made by excluding other causes of chronic pelvic pain such as pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, and prolapse.

### A scoping review of scores or grading systems for pelvic venous disorders [^4a12691f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVD) represent a range of clinical entities with a multifactorial etiology often associated with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), especially in women of reproductive age. This complex group of disorders, initially reported in the late 1800s, has gained increasing recognition during the past few decades. However, due to the heterogeneity of symptoms, overlapping clinical presentations, and absence of universally accepted diagnostic criteria, they remain largely underdiagnosed.

CPP is thought to account for 10% of all outpatient gynecological visits. PeVD are estimated to account for 6% to 30% of cases of CPP. Patients typically present with symptoms of chronic, dull lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by other symptoms such as dyspareunia, postcoital pain, lower back pain, bladder irritability, and urinary urgency. These symptoms are generally exacerbated by increases in intra-abdominal pressure, prolonged standing, or menstruation. Classification of PeVD is challenging, given their diverse symptomatology and complex pathophysiology. Moreover, their multiformity and wide differential diagnosis spanning multiple specialties, makes establishing a diagnostic pathway challenging, often leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Despite the relatively high prevalence of PeVD and their significant impact on the quality of life of those affected, gaps remain in the diagnostic pathway, mainly due to the lack of a standardized and validated scoring or grading systems. Recognizing this, the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation funded a research consensus panel to prioritize a research agenda to address these gaps in 2019. The panel prioritized developing (1) consensus on the clinical and imaging criteria for PeVD; (2) a discriminative tool to categorize patients with PeVD; and (3) quality of life (QOL) tools to measure the health burden for women affected by PeVD and its change after treatment. This scoping review seeks to identify all existing scores or grading systems used in any step of the PeVD management pathway, providing a foundation for the development of robust, universally acceptable clinical scoring tools.

### Ultrasound of pelvic pain in the nonpregnant woman [^46a0f3d1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic ultrasound with endovaginal ultrasound is often the imaging test of choice in the initial evaluation of nonpregnant women with pelvic pain. This article considers the sonographic observations and techniques useful in diagnosis of a variety of gynecologic causes of pelvic pain in these women, including ovarian hemorrhage, ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis (particularly deeply infiltrating endometriosis), endometriomas, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and malpositioned intrauterine contraceptive devices. Sonographic observations regarding a number of non-gynecologic causes of pelvic pain are also described.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^b553d1e5]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Complications

Procedural complications are unusual with overall rates reported as between 2%-3% (Venbrux; Freedman et al; Venbrux). Infection risk is thought to be approximately 1%. Coil migration is reported especially when the internal iliac vein branches are embolized. Coils may migrate to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation with the potential to cause acute or chronic complications such as arrhythmias and thrombosis (Scott and Cullen). Coils should be snared and retrieved at the time of the procedure. Contrast allergy is rare (< 1%). Puncture related hematoma, thrombophlebitis, vessel perforation, non-target embolization and pneumothorax have been reported.

Post procedural discomfort and pain are managed with appropriate analgesia. Use of NSAIDs may alleviate some of the local discomfort which arises from phlebitis.

Delayed complications include recurrence in 10–40% of cases (Meneses et al.). Recurrence is higher in patient with untreated lower extremity varicosities.

Many of the women undergoing OVE are of childbearing age. Machine parameter should be optimized, tight collimation and experienced operators help to keep the radiation dose low. Lopez (Lopez) reported an effective dose in a large series of cases of 6 mSv.

### Clinical presentation and evaluation of pelvic venous disorders in women [^b3d020d2]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The term pelvic venous disorders (PeVD) describes a group of related clinical entities with overlapping clinical presentations that were previously characterized by separate imprecise syndromic terminology. The clinical manifestations of PeVD may variously include chronic pelvic pain; pelvic origin extrapelvic lower extremity and genital varices; lower extremity pain and swelling; and left flank pain and hematuria. This manuscript focuses on the primary manifestations of PeVD in women - chronic pelvic pain and pelvic origin lower extremity and vulvar varices - and will review the underlying pathophysiology and related complicating factors (such as maladaptive pain responses) to explain the variety of clinical presentations.

### Endovascular intervention for pelvic congestion syndrome is justified for chronic pelvic pain relief and patient satisfaction [^cd5a2915]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is difficult to diagnose, poorly understood, and often confused with other causes of chronic pelvic pain. Thus, gonadal vein reflux, its relation to lower extremity venous insufficiency (LEVI), and treatment remains controversial to physicians and payors. We present our experience with endovascular PCS treatment and hypothesize that properly selected patients can realize significant improvement.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients treated for PCS at our institution from 2008 to 2012 was performed. Diagnosis was made clinically by the presence of pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and/or perineal varicosities. Clinical parameters, procedural details, and follow-up were reviewed. A questionnaire including a visual analog scale was sent to patients.

Results

Diagnosis was made in 15 women (mean age, 36 years; mean parity, two). All had pelvic pain, 6 had dyspareunia, 14 had perineal varicosities, and 10 had concomitant LEVI. Fourteen had gonadal vein reflux (mean diameter, 7.4 mm) and pelvic varicosities at angiography and had coiling (n = 12) and/or Amplatzer plug (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, Minn) (n = 4). One patient had stenting of a stenotic left common iliac vein. All patients with concomitant LEVI had successful appropriate treatment. Eight patients completed the questionnaire at a mean follow-up of 4 years. The mean pelvic pain score went from 9.375 to 1.875 post-procedure (P < .0001; Student t-test). Mean dyspareunia score went from 8.875 to 1.5 (P < .0001). Mean perineal varicosity pain score went from 9.285 to 1.285 (P < .0001). Two patients had recurrence with a mean pelvic pain score of 4.5 at a mean 21 months. On a five-point Likert scale, all patients were satisfied (one) or extremely satisfied (seven) with treatment.

Conclusions

Endovascular PCS treatment offers excellent pelvic pain relief and patient satisfaction. Women with pelvic pain, dyspareunia, or perineal varicosities with gonadal vein reflux and pelvic varicosities or iliac vein stenosis should not be denied treatment. A significant number may have concomitant LEVI and should be screened accordingly.

### A comprehensive ultrasound approach to lower limb varicose veins and abdominal-pelvic connections [^fea41f02]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous insufficiency may be responsible for varicose veins located in the pelvic reservoir or for varicose veins in the perineal region and/or lower limbs, being frequently one of the causes of chronic pelvic pain, known as pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), which was recently defined in the document of Transatlantic Interdisciplinary Consensus (VEIN-TERM) as chronic symptoms that may include pelvic pain, perineal heaviness, urination urgency, and post-coital pain, caused by reflux and/or obstruction of pelvic veins, which may be associated with vulvar, perineal, and/or lower-limb varicose veins. PCS most commonly affects women of reproductive age (20–45 years), and the incidence is related to the number of pregnancies. Doppler ultrasonography is considered the first-line investigation method for pelvic venous disorders, as it is noninvasive, easily accessible, and inexpensive, in addition to allowing the exclusion of other pelvic pathologies. Pelvic escape points (PEPs) connect pelvic reflux with lower-limb varicose veins and are easily identified by studying the transperineal region during venous mapping. Unsatisfactory results of traditional treatments for PCS may be related to an incomplete investigation. Based on this, an accurate diagnosis protocol of the entire infra-diaphragmatic venous reservoir becomes indispensable for hemodynamic compression of all these connections.

### The nutcracker syndrome: its role in the pelvic venous disorders [^de4e24a4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of pelvic venous congestion (chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysuria, and dysmenorrhea) have been attributed to massive gonadal reflux. However, obstruction of the gonadal outflow may produce similar symptoms. Mesoaortic compression of the left renal vein (nutcracker syndrome) produces both obstruction and reflux, resulting in symptoms of pelvic congestion. We describe the diagnosis and management of nine patients studied in our institutions.

Materials and Methods

From a group of 51 female patients with pelvic congestion symptoms studied at our institutions, there were nine patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion, microscopic hematuria, and left-sided flank pain. The diagnosis of the nutcracker syndrome was suspected based on clinical examination, Doppler scan, duplex ultrasound scan, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis was confirmed by retrograde cine-video-angiography with renocaval gradient determination and catheterization of both internal iliac venous systems. All patients had a renocaval pressure gradient > 4 mm Hg (normal, 0–1 mm Hg). Renal compression was relieved by external stent (ES) in two patients, internal stent (IS) in one patient, and gonadocaval bypass (GCB) in three. GCB was preceded by coil embolization of internal iliac vein tributaries connecting with lower-extremity varicose veins in three patients. Three patients deferred surgery and are under observation. Mean follow-up time was 36 months (range, 12–72 months).

Results

Hematuria disappeared postoperatively in all patients. ES and IS normalized the renocaval gradient and resulted in significant alleviation of symptoms (90% improvement on a scale of 0–10 where 0 = no improvement and 10 = greatest improvement). Two patients with GCB had a residual gradient of 3 mm Hg. The third patient normalized the gradient. In this group, improvement of symptoms was 60%. Patients awaiting surgery are being treated conservatively (elastic stockings, hormones, and pelvic compression). They have shown only moderate improvement.

Conclusion

The nutcracker syndrome should be considered in women with symptoms of pelvic venous congestion and hematuria. The diagnosis is suspected by compression of the left renal vein on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan and confirmed by retrograde cine-video-angiography with determination of the renocaval gradient. Internal and external renal stenting as well as gonadocaval bypass are effective methods of treatment of the nutcracker syndrome. IS and ES were accompanied by better results than GCB. Surgical and radiologic interventional methods should be guided by the clinical, radiologic, and hemodynamic findings.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome due to central venous outflow obstruction: a single-center experience with May-Thurner and nutcracker syndromes [^601c116f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) due to central venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) such as May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) and nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a significant cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women. This study aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and outcomes of interventional treatments in patients with PCS with MTS and/or NCS.

Methods

This retrospective study included the data of consecutive female patients diagnosed with PCS from 2019 to 2024 in our institution. The collected patient data included age, CPP duration, imaging-diagnosed causes (MTS, NCS, or both), procedure type performed (bilateral iliac vein balloon angioplasty, stent placement, left renal vein balloon angioplasty, left ovarian vein embolization), and use of intraoperative ultrasound. Outcomes assessed included changes in pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]), analgesic use, and quality of life (QOL). Included patients' preoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared statistically using nonparametric tests.

Results

Data of 45 women were included (mean age, 40.9years; median duration of CPP, 3years), with 37.8% diagnosed with MTS alone and 53.3% with both MTS and NCS. Among these, 22 had undergone bilateral iliac vein balloon angioplasty, nine (40.9%) had received stent placement, and nine (40.9%) had received embolization of left ovarian vein additionally. NRS pain scores and postoperative analgesic use were significantly reduced and QOL improvement increased (all P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Interventions for PCS due to CVOO yield significant symptom relief and QOL improvements. Embolization may offer additional benefits in enhancing QoL in this patient population.

### Research priorities in pelvic venous disorders in women: recommendations from a multidisciplinary research consensus panel [^a0519551]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) in women can present with chronic pelvic pain, lower-extremity and vulvar varicosities, lower-extremity swelling and pain, and left-flank pain and hematuria. Multiple evidence gaps exist related to PeVDs with the consequence that nonvascular specialists rarely consider the diagnosis. Recognizing this, the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation funded a Research Consensus Panel to prioritize a research agenda to address these gaps. This paper presents the proceedings and recommendations from that Panel.

### Venous angioplasty and stenting improve pelvic congestion syndrome caused by venous outflow obstruction [^a4351187]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is widely thought to be due to ovarian or internal iliac vein reflux. This report of a retrospective review of treatment of nonthrombotic common iliac vein (CIV) or inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction with relief of symptoms demonstrates an often overlooked pathologic process. Stent placement is evaluated as an effective treatment of PCS due to venous obstruction even if observed left ovarian vein (OV) reflux is left untreated.

Methods

Records from two institutions were reviewed for patients with nonthrombotic venous outflow obstruction and symptoms of PCS severely affecting quality of life. The patients were evaluated with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and intravascular ultrasound before stent placement. From January 2008 through May 2013, 19 patients were treated with stents for severe venous outflow obstruction. Although seven patients also were found to have OV reflux, only one of these was treated with left OV coil occlusion.

Results

Whereas 10 of the 19 patients presented with a chief complaint of lower extremity pain, edema, or varicose veins, all patients described their pelvic symptoms as their dominant complaint. Ultrasound and CT suggested moderate to severe compression of the left CIV in 18 patients and a high-grade stenosis of the suprarenal IVC in one patient. Venography showed outflow obstruction with pelvic collaterals, and intravascular ultrasound confirmed focal severe stenosis of the involved vein. Follow-up of 1 to 59 months (median, 11 months) revealed complete resolution of pelvic pain in 15 of 19 patients and of dyspareunia in 14 of 17 sexually active patients. Of the 15 patients who experienced left lower extremity pain or edema before treatment, 13 experienced complete resolution after treatment. Imaging follow-up by ultrasound or CT showed 16 of the stents to be widely patent, with 3 minor asymptomatic stenoses.

Conclusions

Nonthrombotic obstruction of the left CIV or IVC is an underappreciated cause of PCS. Venous angioplasty and stenting provide excellent short-term results for such patients, with resolution of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Venous obstruction should be considered and carefully evaluated in patients presenting with pelvic congestion, and treatment of obstruction alone may solve the patient's symptoms.

### Diagnosis and management of pelvic venous disorders in women [^6c51734e]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous reflux and obstruction can lead to chronic pelvic pain and extra-pelvic varicosities. This paper will discuss the contemporary understanding of this pathophysiology and its clinical manifestations. It will review evidence-based clinical and imaging criteria of pelvic venous disorders, data supporting benefit from venous interventions, criticisms of the available data and highlight evidence research gaps that exist. Finally, it will argue that comparative outcomes research utilizing standardized patient selection for embolization and stenting, embolization treatment strategies that eliminate the pelvic varices (at least to start), and clinically relevant outcome measures are necessary to establish the benefit of vascular treatments.

Other features of OHSS include free fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavity; the free fluid seen in OHSS is generally simple ascites, although it may display slightly higher attenuation due to ruptured haemorrhagic cysts. The modified Golan classification categorises OHSS as mild, moderate or severe on the basis of symptoms severity and radiologic findings.

Pelvic congestion syndrome

Congested pelvic veins without AT are the hallmark of the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), an underdiagnosed condition that affects 9% of premenopausal women and may be exacerbated by intra-abdominal pressure. The multifactorial pathogenesis involves a family history of varicose veins, previous pelvic surgery, multiple pregnancies, hormonal influences and retroverted uterus. Although the key symptom is chronic dull pelvic pain that worsens in the premenstrual phase, acute and severe pain may also occur. Flow reduction, thrombosis and mass effect on nerves may lead to worsening pelvic pain. Other clinical manifestations may include dyspareunia, postcoital ache, dysmenorrhoea and perineal pain.

Similarly to male varicocele, dilatation of the gonadal veins and pelvic venous plexus more commonly occurs on the left side because of left ovarian vein draining into left renal vein before reaching the inferior vena cava. Mechanical extrinsic compression of drainage veins such as in retroaortic left renal vein, in May-Thurner syndrome (left common iliac vein compression against the lumbar spine by the right common iliac artery) or in nutcracker syndrome (left renal vein compression between superior mesenteric artery and aorta), may lead to venous congestion and engorgement of the ovarian vein. In this latter syndrome, the abrupt narrowing, with a triangular shape, of the proximally dilated left renal vein between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery is referred to as the 'beak sign'. It is one of the most useful CT findings for the diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 88.9% according to the literature. MR angiography provides findings similar to those of CT with the advantage of being less invasive and without radiation exposure in comparison with retrograde venography.

### Current trends in the diagnosis and management of renal nutcracker syndrome: a review [^2ed875fd]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Nutcracker syndrome is caused by compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery where it passes in the fork formed at the bifurcation of these arteries. The phenomenon results in left renal venous hypertension. The syndrome is manifested by left flank and abdominal pain, with or without unilateral haematuria. Other common presentation is as "pelvic congestion syndrome" characterized by symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, post-coital ache, lower abdominal pain, dysuria, pelvic, vulvar, gluteal or thigh varices and emotional disturbances. Likewise compression of the left renal vein can cause left renal-to-gonadal vein reflux resulting in lower limb varices and varicoceles in males. Its diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, basic lab tests to exclude other causes of haematuria, cystoscopy and ureteroscopy to confirm unilateral haematuria and exclude other causes of this sinister symptom. Sequence of imaging has more or less been rationalised to USS with Doppler studies, CT or MR angiography and finally phlebography with renal vein and IVC manometery to confirm the diagnosis.

### Endovascular treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome: visual analog scale (VAS) long-term follow-up clinical evaluation in 202 patients [^c2cfccf9]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical outcome and patients' satisfaction after a 5 year follow-up period for pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) coil embolization in patients who suffered from chronic pelvic pain that initially consulted for lower limb venous insufficiency.

Methods

A total of 202 patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain were recruited prospectively in a single center (mean age 43.5 years; range 27–57) where they were being treated for lower limb varices. Inclusion criteria were: lower limb varices and chronic pelvic pain (> 6 months), > 6 mm pelvic venous caliber in ultrasonography, and venous reflux or presence of communicating veins. Both ovarian and hypogastric veins were targeted for embolization. Pain level was assessed before and after embolotherapy and during follow-up using a visual analog scale (VAS). Technical and clinical success and recurrence of leg varices were studied. Patients completed a quality questionnaire. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months and every year for 5 years.

Results

Technical success was 100%. Clinical success was achieved in 168 patients (93.85%), with complete disappearance of symptoms in 60 patients (33.52%). Pain score (VAS) was 7.34 ± 0.7 preprocedural versus 0.78 ± 1.2 at the end of follow-up (P < 0.0001). Complications were: groin hematoma (n = 6), coil migration (n = 4), and reaction to contrast media (n = 1). Twenty-three cases presented abdominal pain after procedure. In 24 patients (12.5%), there was recurrence of their leg varices within the follow-up. The mean degree of patients' satisfaction was 7.4/9.

Conclusions

Coil embolization of PCS is an effective and safe procedure, with high clinical success rate and degree of satisfaction.
