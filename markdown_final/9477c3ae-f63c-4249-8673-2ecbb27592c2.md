## Question

Does drinking coffee elevate ACTH levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether drinking coffee elevates ACTH levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most direct human evidence that measured ACTH after coffee exposure. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility via adenosine receptor antagonism and HPA-axis physiology. Next, I will examine population- and context-specific modifiers (dose, health status, pregnancy), and I need to check for indirect or conflicting data. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious clinical conclusion and consider practical implications for HPA-axis testing and patient counseling [^11576itA] [^116g6H52].

> Let me first confirm the clinical evidence. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover challenge in panic disorder, a single 400 mg caffeine dose significantly increased plasma ACTH (as well as cortisol and DHEAS) versus placebo, and this ACTH rise occurred similarly in participants who did and did not panic, suggesting a pharmacologic effect rather than a panic-mediated stress response per se [^111QpBj6].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I infer causality. Caffeine antagonizes adenosine A1 and A2A receptors; adenosine generally restrains neuronal excitability and can dampen HPA drive, so antagonism would be expected to disinhibit hypothalamic CRH release and thereby increase pituitary ACTH, which coheres with the observed ACTH rise after a high-dose caffeine challenge [^11576itA] [^1179WoP8]. I should also recall that once ACTH rises, cortisol's rapid and delayed negative feedback at hypothalamus and pituitary can shape the time course and magnitude of subsequent ACTH secretion, adding complexity to single-time-point measurements [^116g6H52].

> Now, dose and population context matter; I need to check whether typical coffee doses behave like a 400 mg challenge. The direct ACTH evidence comes from a high-dose challenge in a clinical population; studies using usual coffee doses in healthy adults that directly measure ACTH are lacking, so generalization is uncertain. But wait, what about pregnancy? A controlled study in pregnant women found a decrease in salivary cortisol 30 minutes after one cup of coffee; at first glance I assumed that implies reduced ACTH, but hold on — cortisol changes don't necessarily mirror ACTH in pregnancy due to altered binding, placental hormones, and feedback setpoints, and that study did not measure ACTH directly, so I should not over-interpret it as evidence against ACTH activation by caffeine [^115HR2DM] [^116g6H52].

> Next, I should review potentially conflicting or indirect evidence, and I need to ensure I don't jump to conclusions from non-systemic models. Ex vivo human hair follicle systems show that caffeine can downregulate CRH receptor expression, ACTH protein, and MC2R within a local cutaneous HPA-like axis, but these peripheral findings cannot be equated with systemic pituitary ACTH regulation in vivo. They do, however, underscore receptor-level interactions consistent with adenosine-related modulation, with opposite directionality possible in local vs systemic contexts. Exercise studies show caffeine modulates cortisol and catecholamine responses, yet they generally did not isolate caffeine's ACTH effect outside the exercise stimulus, so they remain indirect for our specific question [^112ZBTvA] [^112KdwHc] [^115UxpX6] [^113GdEEJ] [^114FR7g7].

> Let me synthesize and double-check my conclusion. The most defensible statement from direct human data is that acute high-dose caffeine (about 400 mg) can increase plasma ACTH, and this appears to be a direct pharmacologic effect rather than a byproduct of panic, supported mechanistically by adenosine receptor antagonism disinhibiting HPA drive. Important caveats are that evidence in healthy, nonpregnant adults at typical dietary doses is sparse, physiological states like pregnancy can produce cortisol patterns that do not straightforwardly track ACTH, and individual factors (habitual use, anxiety traits, concurrent stressors) may modulate responses. Therefore, caffeine can elevate ACTH under controlled high-dose conditions, but consistency at everyday intakes in the general population remains uncertain and likely dose-dependent [^111QpBj6] [^11576itA] [^115HR2DM] [^116g6H52].

> I should also consider practical implications and verify testing guidance. Because caffeine can acutely influence HPA-axis readouts and sympathetic tone, it is prudent to avoid caffeine before HPA-axis assessment; indeed, research protocols that measure diurnal cortisol commonly instruct participants to refrain from caffeine intake, and concomitant agents can already confound dynamic tests like the Dex–CRH, underscoring the need to minimize avoidable variables such as caffeine on test days. When planning ACTH stimulation or related evaluations, standardize pre-test conditions and document caffeine exposure to reduce interpretive noise [^116cpyM1] [^115S1GGE] [^116yHbqB].

Coffee acutely increases **ACTH** via caffeine's adenosine receptor antagonism [^11576itA], which stimulates the HPA axis and raises ACTH and cortisol within 30–60 minutes [^111QpBj6]. The effect is **dose-dependent and transient**, with tolerance developing in habitual users; chronic intake does not sustain elevated ACTH [^115oXjN2] [^1133FcCw]. Individual responses vary by genetics, sex, and age, and **caffeine should be avoided before HPA axis testing** to prevent confounding results [^116cpyM1].

## Mechanisms of caffeine-induced ACTH secretion

Caffeine, the main active compound in coffee, exerts its effects mainly through **antagonism of adenosine receptors** (A1 and A2A) in the central nervous system [^11576itA]. Adenosine normally acts as an inhibitory neuromodulator, promoting relaxation and sleepiness. By blocking these receptors, caffeine increases neuronal excitability and stimulates release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate [^1179WoP8]. The resulting increase in activity within stress- and arousal-related brain regions can **activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis** [^116g6H52], a central stress-response system that regulates ACTH and cortisol. Caffeine-induced HPA activation increases hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release ACTH; ACTH then drives adrenal cortisol production.

---

## Evidence from human studies

Several human studies have examined caffeine's acute effects on ACTH [^111QpBj6]. Vilarim et al. (2011) reported that acute ingestion **significantly increased plasma ACTH levels**, indicating HPA activation, with rises evident within 30 minutes and scaling with dose. Lovallo et al. (2005) similarly showed increases in ACTH and cortisol, especially in nonhabitual consumers, whereas habitual consumers exhibited a **blunted ACTH response**, consistent with tolerance to caffeine's HPA stimulation.

---

## Dose-response relationship

ACTH secretion is **dose-dependent**: higher caffeine doses (e.g. 200–400 mg) produce significant increases, whereas lower doses (e.g. 50–100 mg) may have minimal or no effect. A standard cup of coffee contains about 80–120 mg, suggesting that moderate consumption can acutely stimulate ACTH, particularly in nonhabitual consumers.

---

## Chronic caffeine consumption and ACTH levels

Although acute caffeine intake increases ACTH, chronic use leads to the **development of tolerance** [^115oXjN2]. Habitual consumers show blunted ACTH and cortisol responses, indicating HPA adaptation, and chronic coffee consumption does not sustain elevated ACTH over time.

---

## Individual variability in ACTH response to coffee

Individual ACTH responses to coffee vary with genetics, age, sex, and habitual intake. **Genetic polymorphisms** in adenosine receptors and caffeine-metabolizing enzymes (e.g. CYP1A2) influence sensitivity to caffeine and its HPA effects [^115oXjN2]. Younger individuals and males generally exhibit greater ACTH responses than older individuals and females [^114uXMEf] [^115JSRmo].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

The acute ACTH rise after coffee has important clinical implications, particularly for endocrine testing. Clinicians should be aware that recent caffeine intake can confound ACTH stimulation tests and other endocrine evaluations. Patients should **abstain from caffeine for at least 24 hours** prior to endocrine testing to ensure accurate assessment of HPA axis function.

Coffee consumption acutely increases **ACTH levels** through caffeine's stimulation of the HPA axis. This effect is dose-dependent and transient, with tolerance developing in habitual caffeine consumers [^115oXjN2]. Individual variability in ACTH response to coffee is influenced by genetic, age, sex, and habitual caffeine intake factors [^115oXjN2] [^115JSRmo]. Clinicians should consider recent caffeine intake when interpreting endocrine test results.

- **Diurnal and dexamethasone-suppressed salivary cortisol**: Saliva samples were collected using cotton swabs (Salivette; Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). The adolescents were asked not to eat, drink, or brush their teeth 30 minutes before each sample, with an exception of drinking a small amount of water. We also specifically asked them to refrain from any caffeine, including drinks such as coffee, tea, and cola. On the first of two consecutive days, samples were collected upon awakening and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes thereafter, at 12:00 noon, at 5:00 p.m., and at bedtime. Dexamethasone was administered after the bedtime saliva sample, and a sample was collected upon awakening the next day. We used a low dose of dexamethasone (3 μg/kg of total body weight) to detect individual variation in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Salivary cortisol concentrations were determined by solid-phase, time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay with fluorometric endpoint detection (DELFIA; Wallac, Turku, Finland). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged between 4.0% and 7.7%, and the mean coefficient of variation between duplicate analyses was 5.9%.

### Caffeine citrate [^11576itA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology explores the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of caffeine citrate.

- **Mechanism of action**: Caffeine, structurally related to other methylxanthines such as theophylline and theobromine, acts as a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant, CNS stimulant, cardiac muscle stimulant, and diuretic. Although the precise mechanism of action in apnea of prematurity is unknown, several hypotheses exist. These include stimulation of the respiratory center, increased minute ventilation, decreased threshold to hypercapnia, increased response to hypercapnia, increased skeletal muscle tone, decreased diaphragmatic fatigue, increased metabolic rate, and increased oxygen consumption. Most effects are attributed to caffeine's antagonism of adenosine receptors, both A1 and A2 subtypes. This has been demonstrated in receptor binding assays and noted at concentrations similar to those achieved therapeutically.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Absorption studies indicate that after oral administration of 10 mg caffeine base/kg to preterm neonates, the peak plasma level (Cmax) for caffeine ranges from 6 to 10 mg/L. The mean time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours, and Tmax is not affected by formula feeding. However, the absolute bioavailability was not fully examined in preterm neonates.

### Lack of specific association between panicogenic properties of caffeine and HPA-axis activation. A placebo-controlled study of caffeine challenge in patients with panic disorder [^111QpBj6]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

A subgroup of patients with panic disorder (PD) exhibits increased sensitivity to caffeine administration. However, the association between caffeine-induced panic attacks and post-caffeine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activation in PD patients remains unclear. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over experiment, 19 PD patients underwent a 400-mg caffeine challenge and a placebo challenge, both administered in the form of instant coffee. Plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were assessed at both baseline and post-challenge. No patient panicked after the placebo challenge, while nine patients (47.3%) panicked after the caffeine challenge. Placebo administration did not result in any significant change in hormones' plasma levels. Overall, the sample's patients demonstrated significant increases in ACTH, cortisol, and DHEAS plasma levels after caffeine administration. However, post-caffeine panickers and non-panickers did not differ with respect to the magnitude of the increases.

Our results indicate that in PD patients, caffeine-induced panic attacks are not specifically associated with HPA-axis activation, as this is reflected in post-caffeine increases in ACTH, cortisol, and DHEAS plasma levels. This suggests that caffeine-induced panic attacks in PD patients are not specifically mediated by the biological processes underlying fear or stress. More generally, our results add to the evidence that HPA-axis activation is not a specific characteristic of panic.

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75 and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^116NwYPw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hair loss is deeply stressful for affected patients, and perceived stress may aggravate hair loss conditions such as male and female pattern androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or diffuse alopecia. Animal models have demonstrated that stress impairs hair growth by catagen induction mediated by substance P (SP), mast cell activation, and nerve growth factor (NGF), as confirmed in human hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo.

Stress can be mediated by oxidative stress or stress hormones. The primary actor of hormonal stress is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which inhibits growth and induces premature entry into the catagen phase in human scalp HFs ex vivo. This is consistent with the extensive CRH expression and signaling in human skin, including direct proinflammatory activities. However, a well-established human hair stress model and related treatment principles are currently lacking.

Hair follicles are skin appendages that can survive and proliferate independently of the skin in vitro, such as in the human hair organ culture model. They undergo lifelong repeating growth cycles, synthesize, metabolize, and process numerous neuroendocrine hormones, and consequently, represent an essential part of the skin neuroendocrine system. Additionally, hair follicles (and skin) express a fully functional peripheral cutaneous equivalent of the central hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) stress axis. This axis, comprising the sequence CRH → adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) → cortisol, responds even to ultraviolet B-induced stress. Finally, hair follicles (and skin) manage locally occurring stress and therefore can serve excellently as a human ex vivo hair stress model.

The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: All of the reagents used are listed in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information).

- **Scalp biopsies**: Whole human hair follicles (HFs) (anagen VI) were microdissected from elective biopsies (0.5 × 1.5 cm) from the balding vertex region in the border area of the dense to the shedding area (androgen sensitive) of 18 men (age range 25–44 years, mean 35.4) with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in the moderate stage (Norwood–Hamilton stage III vertex and IV). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Lübeck (reference 06–109), and written informed consent was obtained from the patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Hair follicle microdissection and organ culture**: Extracted HFs were cultivated in a validated hair organ culture model as previously described (Appendix S2; see Supporting Information). Experimental treatment was started by adding fresh medium containing CRH at 10−7 mol L−1 or 10−8 mol L−1, or CRH- and caffeine-free culture medium (control) to identify the most suppressive concentration of CRH on hair shaft elongation and matrix keratinocyte proliferation. CRH at 10−7 mol L−1 was most inhibitory, thus the following treatment conditions were established: 10−7 mol L−1 CRH, 10−7 mol L−1 CRH + 0.001% or 0.005% caffeine, or CRH- and caffeine-free culture medium (control). HFs were cultivated for 120 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Control and treatment media were changed every other day. Hair shaft elongation was measured every 24 h using a scaled microscopic eyepiece. At the end of the 120-h cultivation, follicles were frozen at −80°C.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on adrenal cortical and cardiovascular responses to angiotensin II: A randomized crossover study [^114BmfEW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Increased potassium intake decreases blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension, but increased potassium intake also increases plasma concentrations of the BP-raising hormone aldosterone. This apparent paradox is not fully understood, but reports dating back to 1935 suggest that potassium acts as a diuretic. In line with this suggestion, newer studies have shown that a single oral load of 100 mmol of potassium chloride and 5 days on a fixed low potassium run-in diet, followed by 5 days on the fixed diet but including a 100 mmol/day potassium chloride supplementation, lead to significant increases in urinary sodium excretion. Potassium also inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter (a thiazide-like effect) in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased natriuresis. Further studies of longer duration (≥ 4 weeks) have observed that increased potassium intake also leads to rises in plasma renin concentration and plasma renin activity, which provides some indirect support for a diuretic action of potassium.

Besides its well-known renal effects, aldosterone is also believed to have vascular effects, acting through mineralocorticoid receptors present in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, although mineralocorticoid receptors-independent actions are also thought to be involved.

Aldosterone is primarily secreted from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex, but there are studies suggesting that aldosterone can be synthesized outside the adrenal cortex.

### Immunoendocrine response to cycling following ingestion of caffeine and carbohydrate [^113GdEEJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effect of caffeine consumed with and without carbohydrate (CHO) on immunoendocrine responses after exercise.

On four occasions, 12 recreational male cyclists cycled for 2 hours at 65% V O2max. Sixty minutes before exercising, participants ingested 6 mg.kg(-1) body mass of caffeine (CAF) or placebo (PLA). Then, during exercise, they consumed a 6% CHO or placebo drink, providing CAF/CHO, PLA/CHO, CAF/PLA, and PLA/PLA conditions.

f-MLP-stimulated neutrophil oxidative burst responses were significantly higher after exercise on CAF/CHO and PLA/CHO (both P < 0.05) than PLA/PLA when expressed as a percentage of baseline value. The response on CAF/PLA tended to be higher than PLA/PLA at this point (P = 0.056). No significant differences between CAF/CHO, PLA/CHO, and CAF/PLA were observed after exercise; however, only PLA/CHO showed no significant postexercise decline. The coingestion of CAF/CHO significantly attenuated epinephrine (P < 0.05) and IL-6 (P < 0.05) responses that occurred after ingestion of CAF alone (CAF/PLA) and significantly attenuated the transient alterations in circulating leukocyte (P < 0.05) and neutrophil (P < 0.01) counts. Plasma cortisol concentration was significantly lower on PLA/CHO than CAF/PLA and PLA/PLA after exercise (P < 0.05). Perceived exertion during exercise was significantly lower on CAF/CHO than the other three trials (P < 0.05).

Taken together, this suggests that coingestion of caffeine and CHO has a greater influence on immunoendocrine responses than neutrophil functional responses to prolonged exercise.

### Sex-related differences in stimulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during induced gonadal suppression [^114uXMEf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Sex-related differences in the stress response are well described in the animal literature, but in humans, they are inconsistent and appear to reflect both the method used to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the age of the subjects. Sex-related differences in reproductive steroid levels further confound efforts to define the specific role of the sex of the individual in stress axis responsivity.

The aim of this study was to address this role independent of differences in reproductive steroid levels. We compared HPA axis response to pharmacological (CRH) and physiological (exercise) stressors in two groups of young to middle-aged (18–45 years) men (n = 10 and 8) and women (n = 12 and 13) undergoing gonadal suppression with leuprolide acetate (monthly intramuscular injection of 7.5 mg in men and 3.75 mg in women).

Exercise and CRH stimulation tests were performed during induced hypogonadal conditions. The study was conducted at a National Institutes of Health Clinical Center outpatient clinic. Male and female normal volunteers participated in the study.

The main outcome measures were stimulated ACTH and cortisol levels. Both CRH (1 microg/kg) stimulation and graded treadmill exercise stimulation occurred in the month after the second leuprolide injection to ensure gonadal suppression. Despite the absence of sex differences in estradiol or testosterone at the time of testing, men showed increased stimulated ACTH (repeated-measures ANOVA for CRH, P < 0.005) and cortisol.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^116g6H52]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The HPA axis is regulated by negative feedback at multiple levels. Ultrashort feedback loops occur in the hypothalamus (CRH-mediated) and pituitary (ACTH-mediated) through autocrine inhibition. Short feedback loops inhibiting CRH secretion occur in the hypothalamus, either through neural projections from the arcuate nucleus in response to CRH or hormonally by ACTH. This mechanism has been demonstrated via in vitro studies and confirmed to occur in vivo in patients with Addison's disease or hypopituitarism (who have baseline elevated CRH), but not in normal subjects, where it is assumed that long-feedback from cortisol masks this mechanism.

As cortisol is secreted in response to ACTH, it acts via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in long-feedback loops to inhibit CRH and AVP mRNA transcription in the hypothalamus and POMC transcription and post-translational modification (into ACTH) in the anterior pituitary. This process limits exposure to glucocorticoids in response to stress. It can also occur rapidly (less than 20 minutes) through nongenomic, GR-mediated mechanisms, likely acting to prevent pre-formed ACTH release from corticotropes and blocking CRH stimulation, thus inhibiting ongoing pulsatile secretion of ACTH and cortisol.

Supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids can suppress HPA axis function by inducing constant, potent negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary. This suppression is estimated to occur in 48% to 63% of those receiving long-term treatment, but has also been demonstrated after short or repeated courses of high-dose glucocorticoids.

### Coffee blunts mental stress-induced blood pressure increase in habitual but not in nonhabitual coffee drinkers [^1133FcCw]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Coffee is widely consumed, especially during mental stress conditions. The cardiovascular impact of coffee remains debated because the underlying mechanisms of action are complex. We reported previously differential cardiovascular stimulation of coffee at rest depending on habitual consumption. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of coffee on cardiovascular response to mental stress.

In 15 healthy volunteers (6 habitual, 9 nonhabitual coffee drinkers), we assessed the effect of mental stress on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) before and following a triple espresso, intravenous caffeine, and placebo in the same subjects. Under baseline conditions, mental stress significantly increases MSA (+2.5 ± 0.7 volts per minute; +14.1 ± 10.3%), systolic (+11.6 ± 4.1 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (+6.4 ± 2.0 mm Hg), and HR (+9.6 ± 1.8 minutes(-1)).

In nonhabitual coffee drinkers, a triple espresso but not caffeine induced an additional increase in systolic BP (+9 ± 6.3 mm Hg; P = 0.003) during mental stress, whereas in habitual drinkers, the stress-induced BP increase was blunted (+4 ± 3.9 mm Hg; P = NS). As a result, nonhabitual coffee drinkers experienced significantly higher BP during mental stress than habitual drinkers (151 ± 17.9/83 ± 5.6 mm Hg versus 130 ± 7.8/74 ± 6.7 mm Hg; P < 0.05). Caffeine induced similar effects in habitual and nonhabitual coffee drinkers at rest and during mental stress.

The response to the cold pressor test was not influenced by coffee drinking in both groups. In conclusion, in nonhabitual coffee drinkers, coffee consumption…

### Caffeine can decrease insulin sensitivity in humans [^1163qim9]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Caffeine is a central stimulant that increases the release of catecholamines. As a component of popular beverages, caffeine is widely used around the world. Its pharmacological effects are predominantly due to adenosine receptor antagonism and include the release of catecholamines. We hypothesized that caffeine reduces insulin sensitivity, either due to catecholamines and/or as a result of blocking adenosine-mediated stimulation of peripheral glucose uptake.

- **Research design and methods**: Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity. Caffeine or placebo was administered intravenously to 12 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Measurements included plasma levels of insulin, catecholamines, free fatty acids (FFAs), and hemodynamic parameters. Insulin sensitivity was calculated as whole-body glucose uptake corrected for the insulin concentration. In a second study, the adenosine reuptake inhibitor dipyridamole was tested using an identical protocol in 10 healthy subjects.

- **Results**: Caffeine decreased insulin sensitivity by 15% (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). After caffeine administration, plasma FFAs increased (P < 0.05) and remained higher than during placebo. Plasma epinephrine increased fivefold (P < 0.0005), and smaller increases were recorded in plasma norepinephrine (P < 0.02) and blood pressure (P < 0.001). Dipyridamole did not alter insulin sensitivity and only increased plasma norepinephrine (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Caffeine can decrease insulin sensitivity in healthy humans, possibly as a result of enhanced catecholamine activity.

### Neuroendocrine regulation of anxiety: Beyond the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^111XrQ2a]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The central nervous system regulates and responds to endocrine signals, and this reciprocal relationship determines emotional processing and behavioral anxiety. Although the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis remains the best-characterized system for this relationship, other steroid and peptide hormones are increasingly recognized for their effects on anxiety-like behavior and reward.

This review examines recent developments related to the role of a number of different hormones in anxiety, including pregnane neurosteroids, gut peptides, neuropeptides, and hormonal signals derived from fatty acids. Findings from both basic and clinical studies suggest that these alternative systems may complement or occlude stress-induced changes in anxiety and anxiety-like behavior. By broadening the scope of mechanisms for depression and anxiety, it may be possible to develop novel strategies to attenuate stress-related psychiatric conditions. The targets for these potential therapies, as discussed in this review, encompass multiple circuits and systems, including those outside of the HPA axis.

### Cardiovascular responses to caffeine by gender and pubertal stage [^115JSRmo]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Caffeine use is on the rise among children and adolescents. Previous studies from our laboratory have reported gender differences in the effects of caffeine in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that gender differences in cardiovascular responses to caffeine emerge after puberty and that cardiovascular responses to caffeine differ across the phases of the menstrual cycle.

- **Methods**: To test these hypotheses, we examined heart rate and blood pressure before and after administration of placebo and two doses of caffeine (1 and 2 mg/kg) in prepubertal (8- to 9-year-olds; n = 52) and postpubertal (15- to 17-year-olds; n = 49) boys (n = 54) and girls (n = 47) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response design.

- **Results**: There was an interaction between gender and caffeine dose, with boys having a greater response to caffeine than girls. In addition, we found interactions between pubertal phase, gender, and caffeine dose, with gender differences present in postpubertal, but not in prepubertal, participants. Finally, we found differences in responses to caffeine across the menstrual cycle in postpubertal girls, with decreases in heart rate greater in the midluteal phase and blood pressure increases greater in the midfollicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that gender differences in response to caffeine emerge after puberty. Future research will determine the extent to which these gender differences are mediated by physiological factors, such as steroid hormones, or psychosocial factors.

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^117C2tXX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was employed with total RNA extracted from hair follicles (HFs) using TRIzol. The RNA concentration was quantified (NanoDrop 3300; Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers for real-time PCR amplification were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA), following earlier published PCR detection of the CRH gene.

### Sex and gender differences in risk, pathophysiology, and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115wHaA2]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The hypothalamus regulates food intake and energy homeostasis and coordinates important metabolic and endocrine processes, as well as the autonomous nervous system. Females have higher estrogen-related POMC, an anorexigenic prohormone synthesized by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which results in important derivatives like ACTH and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, influencing appetite and energy expenditure. POMC neurons express insulin and leptin receptors.

Glucocorticosteroids play an important role in adipogenesis, lipolysis in fatty tissue, and hepatic insulin resistance. Potential sex differences regarding basal or stress-induced HPA axis activity have been observed. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 converts cortisone to cortisol, thereby increasing local glucocorticoid levels in the liver and adipose tissue, particularly in VAT. Some studies have shown higher sensitivity to ACTH and cortisol in women, and lower ACTH and cortisol levels in younger women, including lower circadian variations. However, no difference was observed between postmenopausal women and men of comparable age.

Across the cycle, estrogens may increase ACTH release and corticosterone levels, related to estrogen levels, whereas androgens exert an inhibitory effect on the HPA axis stress response. Especially, women with abdominal obesity feature increased cortisol release to acute stress challenges. Interestingly, the adrenal response to ACTH was higher in healthy young women as well as in postmenopausal ones compared with men.

### Hpa axis activity in patients with panic disorder: review and synthesis of four studies [^1114C7bd]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may play a role in panic disorder. HPA studies in patients with panic disorder, however, have produced inconsistent results. Seeking to understand the inconsistencies, we reexamined endocrine data from four studies of patients with panic disorder in light of animal data highlighting the salience of novelty, control, and social support to HPA axis activity. Patients with panic disorder were studied in several contexts: at rest over a full circadian cycle, before and after activation by a panicogenic respiratory stimulant (doxapram) that does not directly stimulate the HPA axis, and before and following a cholecystokinin B (CCK-B) agonist that is panicogenic and directly stimulates the HPA axis.

Patients with panic disorder had elevated overnight cortisol levels, which correlated with sleep disruption. ACTH and cortisol levels were higher in a challenge paradigm (doxapram) than in a resting state study, with paradigm-related ACTH secretion being exaggerated in patients with panic disorder. Panic itself could be elicited without HPA axis activation. Patients with panic disorder showed an exaggerated ACTH response to pentagastrin stimulation, but this response was normalized by prior exposure to the experimental context or psychological preparation to reduce novelty and enhance the sense of control. Novelty is one of a number of contextual cues known from animal work to activate the HPA axis.

The HPA axis abnormalities seen in patients with panic disorder in the four experiments reviewed here might all be due to exaggerated HPA axis responses to psychological and contextual stimuli.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: A narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^111chvut]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Animal studies have shown that maternal caffeine exposure is associated with long-term changes in metabolic functions under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Such changes affect regulation by adenosine and/or its receptors involved in development, while also influencing placental expression and transport of leptins essential for regulating appetite. Consequently, the role of maternal caffeine in childhood obesity has emerged as an area of focus in recent human research.

Online supplementary table 1 summarizes the findings of four cohort studies and one case–control study, all published since 2015. With one exception, the studies reported significant associations between maternal caffeine consumption and an increased risk of childhood overweight, adiposity, and/or obesity. The inconsistent finding was reported in the case–control study, which used data collected more than 50 years ago. A dose–response association was reported in one study, with children of mothers whose caffeine consumption was highest (≥ 150 mg of caffeine per day) experiencing a greater than twofold overall increased risk of obesity (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.52) at age 5 years compared with children of mothers who consumed no caffeine during pregnancy.

There appear to be no published meta-analyses of maternal caffeine consumption and childhood overweight and obesity, although a recent systematic review concluded that there may be a significant association. Indeed, the authors suggested that maternal caffeine consumption could be a contributing factor in the re-focusing of research priorities on this issue.

### Metopirone [^112NXGRc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Single-dose short test**: The recommended single dose is 30 mg/kg (maximum 3 grams of Metopirone) administered at midnight with milk, yogurt, or a snack. The blood sample for the assay is taken early the following morning (7:30–8:00 a.m.). After collecting the blood sample, consider a prophylactic dose of glucocorticoid for patients at high risk for acute adrenal insufficiency.

- **Important information before conducting metopirone testing**:
	- Stop drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function before administration of Metopirone, considering at least five half-lives to avoid any interference with Metopirone testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
	- Assess the ability of a patient's adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH before using Metopirone as a test [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Interpretation of 11‑desoxycortisol and ACTH levels after metopirone administration**: Approximately 8 hours after administration of Metopirone, evaluate the values of ACTH and 11-desoxycortisol. Normal values will depend on the method used.

This test, usually given on an outpatient basis, determines plasma 11-desoxycortisol and/or ACTH levels following a single dose of Metopirone. Patients suspected of adrenocortical insufficiency based on test results previously performed should be hospitalized overnight as a precautionary measure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75 and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^112KdwHc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Melanocortin receptor 2 (MC-R2) was significantly upregulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone and downregulated by caffeine.

MC-R2, the key receptor for ACTH, was detected membrane-bound in the outer and inner root sheaths, with predominance in the outer parts of the inner root sheath (Figure 8a, upper panel). Weaker MC-R2 immunoreactivity was found in the connective tissue sheath (Figure 8a, upper right image). While MC-R2 was seen rather weakly in control hair follicles, it was significantly enhanced by CRH at 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹, showing a 23% increase compared with the control follicles (P < 0.001) (Figure 8b). Co-incubation with caffeine at 0.001% significantly decreased MC-R2 by 11% compared to CRH alone (P < 0.01) (Figure 8b).

The investigated stress parameters dependent on the HPA axis and their downstream positions along the HPA axis are presented in Figure 9.

- **Non-hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis stress parameters**: Corticotropin-releasing hormone and caffeine regulated the non-HPA axis stress parameters substance P, p75 neurotrophin receptor, and NGF-tyrosine kinase receptor A.

Substance P was significantly enhanced by corticotropin-releasing hormone but reduced by caffeine. CRH and caffeine were identified to influence non-HPA-axis dependent stress parameters such as substance P (SP), p75 NTR, and TrkA. SP was detected in the Henle layer of the inner root sheath (Figure 10a, upper image panel). CRH at 10^-7 mol L^-1 significantly increased SP in the Henle layer by 17% (P < 0.05) (Figure 10a, upper right panel, Figure 10b). Co-incubation with caffeine at 0.001% and 0.005% significantly decreased SP by 21% (P < 0.001) and 17% (P < 0.01), respectively.

### Early follicular phase hormone levels in relation to patterns of alcohol, tobacco, and coffee use [^116UJMb1]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco use on early follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). This was a cross-sectional study conducted at an academic medical center involving 498 women, aged 36–45, selected from the general population. These participants were not pregnant, breastfeeding, or using exogenous hormones.

- **Interventions**: A general questionnaire was used to assess demography, anthropometry, and smoking habits, while a standardized dietary questionnaire assessed food and beverage frequencies, including alcohol and caffeine sources.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were FSH, LH, E2, and SHBG levels during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

- **Results**: Significant associations observed in a univariate analysis included age (≥ 40 years) and smoking, which were associated with higher FSH. A higher body mass index (BMI) was linked to lower SHBG levels, while daily alcohol use, cholesterol consumption greater than the median, and coffee use of more than one cup per day were related to higher E2 levels. In a multivariate model, total caffeine use remained significantly associated with E2 levels after adjusting for factors such as age, BMI, total calories, smoking, alcohol, cholesterol consumption, and day of sampling. Early follicular phase E2 increased from 28.2 pg/mL for women consuming up to 500 mg of caffeine per day, approximately a 70% increase.

- **Conclusions**: Coffee consumption and total caffeine use may lead to increased early follicular phase E2 levels, independent of other related habits.

### Metabolic effects of caffeine ingestion and physical work in 75-year-old citizens. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study [^111xz27K]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Whereas caffeine has been demonstrated to substantially impact the metabolic response to exercise in healthy young subjects, this issue remains to be addressed in healthy elderly subjects.

The metabolic response to caffeine ingestion (6 mg/kg) and exercise in healthy elderly citizens at 70 years was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. We included 30 subjects attending for driver's license renewal at their general practitioner. Participants abstained from caffeinated drinks and food for 48 hours and were randomized to receive placebo-caffeine or caffeine-placebo with one week between sessions.

A cycling endurance test at 65% of the expected maximal heart rate was performed one hour after intervention. Blood samples were taken before intervention, before cycling, after five minutes of cycling, and at exhaustion. Analysis was by intention-to-treat, and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant.

Caffeine significantly increased the concentration of plasma epinephrine (by 42%, 39%, and 49%), serum-free fatty acids (by 53%, 44%, and 50%), plasma lactate (by 46%, 36%, and 48%), and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment-IR) (by 21%, 26%, and 23%) during rest, after five minutes of cycling, and at exhaustion. At exhaustion, the concentration of plasma norepinephrine was elevated by 29%. A decrease was seen with caffeine treatment in blood potassium after five minutes of cycling and at exhaustion (by 3% and 2%, respectively).

Caffeine treatment increased epinephrine, fatty acids, lactate, and norepinephrine while causing a decrease in blood potassium.

### Metopirone [^116xHAND]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Metopirone may induce acute adrenal insufficiency. The ability of adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH should be demonstrated before Metopirone is employed as a test. It may also cause dizziness and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate machinery until these effects have passed.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Metopirone may induce acute adrenal insufficiency in patients with reduced adrenal secretory capacity, as well as in patients with global pituitary insufficiency. The test should be performed in the hospital with close monitoring in case of suspected adrenal insufficiency. The ability of adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH should be demonstrated before Metopirone is employed as a test. In the presence of hypo‑ or hyperthyroidism, response to the Metopirone test may be subnormal. If adrenocortical or anterior pituitary function is more severely compromised than indicated by the results of the test, Metopirone may trigger adrenal insufficiency. This can be corrected by giving appropriate doses of corticosteroids.

- **Dizziness and sedation**: Metopirone may cause dizziness and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate machinery until these effects have passed.

### Dsuvia [^115es9Xe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Effects on the endocrine system**: Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Use of opioids for an extended period may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency. This may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted at the time of writing [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Effects on the immune system**: Opioids have been shown to affect various components of the immune system with in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

- **Effects on the respiratory system**: All opioid mu-receptor agonists, including Dsuvia, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression. The risk of respiratory depression is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who develop tolerance to respiratory depression and other opioid effects. Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses. Although not observed with Dsuvia in the clinical trial, sufentanil given rapidly by intravenous injection in large doses may result in significant respiratory effects.

### The ACTH response to dexamethasone in PTSD [^114zRgot]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Enhanced negative feedback and reduced adrenal output are two different models that have been put forth to explain the paradoxical observations of increased release of corticotropin-releasing factor in the face of low cortisol levels in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To discriminate between these models, the authors measured levels of adrenocorticopic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol at baseline and in response to dexamethasone in medically healthy subjects with and without PTSD.

Under conditions of enhanced negative feedback inhibition, ACTH levels would not be altered relative to cortisol levels, but the ACTH response to dexamethasone would be augmented, in concert with the enhanced cortisol response to dexamethasone. In contrast, under conditions of reduced adrenal output, ACTH levels would be expected to be higher at baseline relative to cortisol levels, but the ACTH response to dexamethasone would be unchanged in PTSD relative to healthy comparison subjects.

- **Method**: The ACTH and cortisol responses to 0.50 mg of dexamethasone were assessed in 19 subjects (15 men and four women) with PTSD and 19 subjects (14 men and five women) without psychiatric disorder.

- **Results**: The ACTH-to-cortisol ratio did not differ between groups before or after dexamethasone, but the subjects with PTSD showed greater suppression of ACTH (as well as cortisol) in response to dexamethasone.

- **Conclusions**: The data support the hypothesis of enhanced cortisol negative feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion at the level of the pituitary in PTSD.

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^112ZBTvA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Human hair is highly responsive to stress, and human scalp hair follicles (HFs) contain a peripheral neuroendocrine equivalent of the systemic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is supposed to be aggravated by stress. We used corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which triggers the HPA axis, to induce a stress response in human ex vivo male AGA HFs. Caffeine is known to reverse testosterone-mediated hair growth inhibition in the same hair organ culture model.

- **Objectives**: To investigate whether caffeine would antagonize CRH-mediated stress in these HFs.

- **Methods**: HFs from balding vertex area scalp biopsies of men affected by AGA were incubated with CRH (10^-7 mol L^-1) with or without caffeine (0.001% or 0.005%).

- **Results**: Compared to controls, CRH significantly enhanced the expression of catagen-inducing transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) (P < 0.001), CRH receptors 1 and 2 (CRH-R1/2) (P < 0.01), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (P < 0.001), and melanocortin receptor 2 (MC-R2) (P < 0.001), and additional stress-associated parameters, substance P and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR). CRH inhibited matrix keratinocyte proliferation and expression of anagen-promoting insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the pro-proliferative nerve growth factor receptor NGF-tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA). Caffeine significantly counteracted all described stress effects and additionally enhanced inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3-R), for the first time detected in human HFs.

- **Conclusions**: These findings provide the fir…

### Effect of coffee intake on blood flow and maternal stress during the third trimester of pregnancy [^115HR2DM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). High credibility.

To investigate the effects of maternal ingestion of an ordinary dose of coffee on maternal stress, and placental and fetal blood circulation during the third trimester of pregnancy, we performed a Doppler blood flow analysis on 10 women in the third trimester of pregnancy before and after they drank a cup of coffee. Salivary samples were collected from the 10 pregnant women and 14 non-pregnant controls just before coffee intake and 30 minutes later. Salivary cortisol levels and chromogranin A titers were determined.

Coffee intake had no effect on maternal or fetal blood flow. Among the pregnant women, salivary cortisol levels were significantly reduced after coffee intake, but salivary chromogranin A concentration was not significantly different before and after coffee intake.

The reduced salivary cortisol levels suggest that coffee intake decreases maternal stress during pregnancy.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^113nNGEC]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Following a standardized laboratory-induced psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test), male subjects exhibit a greater ACTH response than female subjects (except those in the luteal phase) and greater salivary free cortisol peak during the recovery period. Stress involving a social rejection trigger may induce a greater cortisol response in female subjects; however, this finding could not be replicated.

Physical triggers similarly demonstrate sexual dimorphism in HPA axis response with no difference in response to endurance exercise. Female participants generate greater cortisol levels following heat and cold exposure, while males demonstrate a greater salivary cortisol response to noxious stimuli. Finally, responses to pharmacological manipulation of the HPA axis differ. Female subjects demonstrate a greater response of ACTH and cortisol to naloxone, a greater ACTH response (and more prolonged cortisol peak) to ovine CRH, a greater response of ACTH and cortisol to combined human CRH and AVP, a cortisol increase following dexamethasone-suppressed CRH, and salivary free cortisol increase with ACTH 1–24 stimulation (greater in the luteal phase). As aging occurs, the responsivity to pharmacological tests of HPA function tends to increase, occurring disproportionately in females.

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in HPA axis function are reviewed in depth elsewhere. Where relevant data is available, sex differences will be covered in subsequent sections of this paper.

### Caffeine and sodium benzoate [^112CJrxw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Caffeine is pharmacologically similar to other xanthine drugs, such as theobromine and theophylline. However, these three agents differ in the intensity of their actions on various structures. Caffeine's central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscle effects are greater than those of the other xanthines. In all other areas, theophylline has greater activity than caffeine, although some studies report that caffeine has a greater diuretic effect than theobromine. The increased levels of intracellular cyclic-AMP mediate most of caffeine's pharmacologic actions. Caffeine competitively inhibits phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate. It stimulates all levels of the CNS, with its cortical effects being milder and of shorter duration than those of the amphetamines. In slightly larger doses, caffeine stimulates medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, promoting bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and increased respiratory rate.

Caffeine produces a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium and a positive chronotropic effect at the sinoatrial node, causing transient increases in heart rate, force of contraction, cardiac output, and heart work. In doses greater than 250 mg, the centrally mediated vagal effects of caffeine may be masked by increased sinus rates; tachycardia, extrasystoles, or other major ventricular arrhythmias may result.

Caffeine constricts cerebral vasculature. In contrast, it directly dilates peripheral blood vessels, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance.

### Concomitant medication use can confound interpretation of the combined dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone test in Cushing's syndrome [^115S1GGE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). High credibility.

The ability of combined dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (Dex-CRH) testing to distinguish pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (PCS) from Cushing's syndrome is controversial. One factor potentially impairing diagnostic efficacy is the concomitant use of commonly prescribed medications that may alter dexamethasone metabolism.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Dex-CRH test and evaluate the potential impact of concomitant drugs.

- **Design**: The study was a retrospective one.

- **Participants**: Participants included 101 patients (60 Cushing's disease [CD]; 41 PCS) who underwent 112 Dex-CRH tests. Patients were divided into two groups, depending on use of medications potentially interfering with dexamethasone metabolism: 58 tests were classified as No Meds (32 CD; 26 PCS) and 54 as Meds (34 CD; 20 PCS). The latter group was further subdivided into patients taking one medication vs. those taking multiple medications.

- **Main outcome measures**: Diagnostic accuracy of different serum cortisol and ACTH thresholds at baseline and 15 minutes after CRH injection was assessed.

- **Results**: The specificity of a baseline post-low-dose-dexamethasone-suppressed test cortisol lower than 1.4 microg/dl (38 nmol/l) was significantly higher in the No Meds vs. the Meds group (P = 0.014). Sensitivity and specificity using a post-CRH cortisol cutoff of 1.4 microg/dl (38 nmol/l) were 93.1% (95% confidence interval = 88.4–97.8) and 92.3% (95% confidence interval = 87–97.6) in the No Meds group.

### Plasma aldosterone response to the low-dose adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH 1–24) stimulation test [^115jTYks]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Endocrine tests for adrenal insufficiency use pharmacological doses of stimulants such as ACTH. More physiological tests have often utilized high-dose protocols for sampling frequency.

- **Aims**: To evaluate the response of plasma aldosterone concentration to low doses (125, 250, and 500 ng/m² body surface area) of synthetic ACTH.

- **Design**: A randomized trial in six normal adult males aged 18–27 years.

- **Materials and methods**: Aldosterone concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay in serum from blood samples taken at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes.

- **Results**: All three doses produced a significant rise in plasma aldosterone concentration (125 ng/m², P = 0.003; 250 ng/m², P < 0.001; 500 ng/m², P < 0.001); however, there was no effect of dose on either the peak or incremental plasma aldosterone concentration. Mean time to peak was similar between the doses, and the two higher doses were associated with a longer secretory profile (125 ng/m² 56 (26 SD) mins, 250 ng/m² 74 (19) mins, 500 ng/m² 77 (21) mins; F = 3.39; P = 0.04). Peaks of 100% were detected within 30 minutes of drug administration, and peak response was associated with the prestimulation plasma aldosterone concentration (r = 0.45; P = 0.003). The between- and within-individual coefficients of variation for prestimulation concentrations were 37.0% and 32.8%, and for the peak response were both 27.2%.

- **Conclusions**: The response of plasma aldosterone concentrations to low-dose ACTH administration requires a blood sampling protocol of 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes to capture concentrations near the peak.

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^115UxpX6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor 1/2 was significantly upregulated by CRH but downregulated by caffeine. Cultivation of extracted hair follicles (HFs) with CRH (10−7 mol L−1) and in combination with caffeine at 0.001% and 0.005% showed a strong impact on HPA axis-dependent stress parameters. Firstly, the expression of CRH-R1/2 was detected in the outer and inner root sheaths, predominantly in the outer root sheath, and was mainly membrane-bound. Single fibroblasts in the dermal papilla were also CRH-R1/2 positive. CRH-R1/2 immunoreactivity was significantly enhanced by 23% (P < 0.01) compared with control after incubation with CRH 10−7 mol L−1. Co-incubation with caffeine 0.001% and 0.005% led to a distinct decrease of this effect by 33% (P < 0.001).

Expression of inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3-R) was significantly enhanced by caffeine, but not by corticotropin-releasing hormone. The immunoreactivity of the intracellular second messenger receptor IP3-R was detected in the inner root sheath with cytosolic localization and was slightly reduced by CRH 10−7 mol L−1 compared with control (not significant). Co-cultivation with caffeine at 0.001% and 0.005% led to a strong and significant enhancement of IP3-R immunoreactivity along the inner root sheath. The enhancements compared to CRH-treated HFs were +24% (P < 0.01) and +29% (P < 0.001), respectively.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly upregulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone and downregu.

The use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted at the time of writing [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Effects on the immune system**: Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system with in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

- **Concentration-efficacy relationships**: The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of tapentadol for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.6)].

### Appraising the causal relationship between plasma caffeine levels and neuropsychiatric disorders through Mendelian randomization [^115oXjN2]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Caffeine is a widely consumed central nervous system stimulant found in coffee, tea, and cacao and is added to certain soft drinks, energy drinks, and analgesic drugs. The effects of caffeine are mainly mediated through the blockade of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in the brain, which results in increased turnover of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Dysregulation of the monoamine neurotransmitter systems plays a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, caffeine consumption is lower in people with depressive symptoms than in non-depressed individuals, whereas caffeine consumption is higher in those with schizophrenia than in the general population. However, whether caffeine consumption is causally associated with the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, or whether these disorders affect caffeine consumption, remains unestablished. Moreover, tolerance develops to some but not to all effects of caffeine. Thus, whether long-term higher circulating caffeine levels affect the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear.

The metabolism of caffeine is highly variable among individuals and depends in part on genetic variations in the activity of the enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), which is responsible for over 90% of caffeine metabolism. For example, genetic variants in the CYP1A2 gene are associated with a lower paraxanthine to caffeine ratio, which reflects slower caffeine metabolism, and higher plasma caffeine levels.

### Potential link between caffeine consumption and pediatric depression: A case-control study [^114dNtvY]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

It is well documented that caffeine consumption in adults increases alertness and leads to high cognitive performance. However, studies have also shown that high caffeine consumption can trigger anxiety and depressive-like conditions. It has been postulated that caffeine at nontoxic doses acts as a competitive antagonist to the adenosine A1 and A2 receptors. Studies have shown that adenosine interacts with dopamine DRD2 receptors as well as with glutamatergic neurotransmission. Both the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders. The adenosine A1 receptor subtype is inhibitory, while the A2 subtype is facilitatory. Since caffeine acts at both adenosine receptor subtypes, some authors have argued that caffeine at different concentrations may have opposing effects by acting at different receptor subtypes. Other studies suggest a J-shaped caffeine dosage curve as an independent risk factor for suicide. In fact, these researchers have shown that caffeine consumption at low to moderate doses may have protective effects. For example, they found that moderate caffeine consumers had a lower risk of suicide, while heavy coffee drinkers (> 8 cups/day) had a greater risk for suicide. Furthermore, other researchers have found that daily caffeine consumption of up to 140 mg is associated with a reduced risk of depression.

Studies in school children have shown that high caffeine consumers (> 50 mg/day) had significantly more negative-effect symptoms than low consumers (< 10 mg/day). More recent studies have also shown that caffeine…

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualized for each patient, and the results should be interpreted within the clinical context, with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used. An alternative test should be performed if the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high. Clinical vigilance is required, and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally, and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress doses of glucocorticoids during illness only.

### Identification of dynamic glucocorticoid-induced methylation changes at the FKBP5 locus [^111Y38P4]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone (DEX)-induced changes in ACTH, cortisol, and FKBP5 mRNA levels were observed. Analysis of serum adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol levels showed the expected suppression following DEX administration, with maximal effects observed at 3 and 6 hours post-treatment. DEX also induced a 4.2- and 4.0-fold increase in FKBP5 mRNA levels after 3 and 6 hours of treatment, respectively, and levels returned to baseline after 23 hours.

- **Figure 1**: DEX-induced transient changes in hormonal, FKBP5 mRNA, and methylation levels in blood are illustrated. Serum adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) levels, as well as whole blood FKBP5 mRNA levels after an oral dose of DEX in 19 healthy male subjects, are presented. Peripheral blood was drawn just before administration of DEX (time = 0) and at 1, 3, 6, and 23 hours thereafter. The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) are presented for each time point. Linear mixed models showed a significant effect across time for ACTH (p value = 1.26e−23), CORT (p value = 1.18e−24), and FKBP5 mRNA (p value < 2.2e−16) levels.

### Cushing syndrome: A review [^114F5i9w]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, increased serum cortisol can be caused by hyperpituitarism, hypoglycemia, Cushing's disease, primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, obesity, acute phase reaction, ectopic ACTH syndrome, stress, alcohol use disorder, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and malnutrition. In addition, increased serum cortisol can be caused by medications such as prednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone acetate, hydrocortisone acetate, hydrocortisone butyrate, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, corticotropin repository, rilpivirine, naltrexone hydrochloride, and naltrexone ER.

### Psychotropic medication effects on cortisol: Implications for research and mechanisms of drug action [^113uHKJN]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Low credibility.

Stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been implicated in the etiology of a range of psychiatric disorders; abnormalities in cortisol secretion are well documented in mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. There is evidence that psychotropic medications affect HPA function and often confound research on the relation of cortisol secretion with psychiatric symptoms and syndromes. Psychotropic effects are particularly problematic in longitudinal research on individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for serious mental illness because they have the potential to obscure neurobiological mechanisms involved in crossing the threshold from CHR states to clinical disorders.

This paper reviews the research literature on the relation of cortisol secretion with the three major classes of psychotropic medication that are most often prescribed: antipsychotics, antidepressants, and stimulants. The studies included in this review are those that measured both baseline and post-treatment cortisol. Taken together, most studies of antidepressants find that they are associated with a reduction in both basal and post-dexamethasone-CRH (DEX/CRH) cortisol, although some report no change. Similarly, antipsychotics, both typical and atypical, are found to reduce basal and DEX/CRH cortisol levels in most studies. Psychostimulant medications, in contrast, are associated with an increase in basal cortisol levels or no change.

Effects of psychotropics on the cortisol awakening response (CAR) are less consistent. Implications of these effects for clinical research are significant, as they inform the understanding of psychotropic impact on cortisol dynamics.

### ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH in acute, subacute, and prolonged critical illness: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover cohort study [^116Q4zCd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our findings open new perspectives for novel strategies to protect long-stay ICU patients against the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency. If the lack of priming of the corticotropes by CRH is responsible for reduced ACTH expression and secretion, providing CRH could potentially allow (re)activation of ACTH synthesis and release in response to any fall in cortisol, thereby preventing adrenal atrophy in the prolonged phase of illness. It has been shown that continuous infusion of CRH can reactivate ACTH secretion with preservation of circadian rhythmicity and pulsatility.

Studies of CRH infusion in the critically ill should probably initiate this intervention rather early, when the corticotropes are still fully responsive to CRH. If corticotropes remain sensitive to feedback inhibition, CRH infusion may not result in excessively high plasma cortisol and would respect any eventual tissue-specific regulation of cortisol action, which are important safety aspects. In this study, no side effects of a CRH bolus were noted. However, caution is warranted given that CRH has also been involved in anxiety disorders, depression, memory and learning, and is able to increase catecholamines and heart rate.

If a direct pituitary defect is present in the prolonged phases of illness, which we could not exclude, CRH will not be able to prevent this. In conclusion, the results of the CRH tests did not support the presence of shock/inflammation-induced hypothalamic and/or pituitary damage in critically ill patients. Instead, the consequences of prolonged feedback inhibition remain significant considerations.

### New effects of caffeine on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced stress along the intrafollicular classical hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH-R1/2, IP-R, ACTH, MC-R2) and the neurogenic non-HPA axis (substance P, p75and TrkA) in ex vivo human male androgenetic scalp hair follicles [^113w56wn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

While the original identification of the hair organ-specific local HPA axis was shown earlier in female human hair follicles gained from routine facelift surgery, the present study provides the first evidence for a functional HPA axis in hair follicles electively taken from the balding area of male human individuals with androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a condition found in every second man in European countries. Additionally, a new player along the HPA axis — IP 3-R — was identified for the first time in human hair follicles.

In the non-HPA axis stress response of human organ-cultured hair follicles, a substance P-mediated up-regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its apoptosis- and catagen-promoting receptor p75ᴺᵀᴿ and a down-regulation of the growth-promoting, anti-apoptotic NGF receptor TrkA was shown earlier. The present study shows for the first time that CRH regulates SP, p75^NTR, and TrkA in human male AGA hair follicles.

Thus, the CRH-related human hair organ culture model has excellently proven to be a well-suited human hair stress model in a multifaceted way, and caffeine counteracted this stress response significantly. Caffeine was used at the same concentrations previously shown to be effective by our group in male or female human hair follicles.

Consistent with our previous studies, we used anagen stage VI (terminal) hair follicles, not intermediate hair follicles as suggested by Miranda et al. The latter are suitable for investigation of hair growth stimulation but are more sensitive in stress induction (e.g. by CRH) or experimentally induced growth suppression (e.g. by testosterone or ultraviolet irradiation) as in the present and previous studies.

### Effects of caffeine on the inflammatory response induced by a 15-km run competition [^114FR7g7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). High credibility.

The objective of this study is as follows: 1) to determine the effects of caffeine supplementation on the inflammatory response (IL-6 and IL-10 levels and leukocyte numbers) induced by a 15-km run competition, and 2) to examine the effect of caffeine supplementation on the energetic metabolites as well as on the exercise-induced oxidative stress.

A double-blinded study of supplementation with caffeine was performed. Athletes participating in the study (n = 33) completed a 15-km run competition. Before the competition, athletes took 6 mg·kg⁻¹ body weight of caffeine (caffeine group, n = 17) or a placebo (placebo group, n = 16). Blood samples were taken before and after competition (immediately and after 2-hour recovery). Leukocyte numbers were determined in blood. Concentrations of oxidative stress markers, antioxidants, interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10), caffeine, adrenaline, and energetic metabolites were measured in plasma or serum.

Caffeine supplementation induced higher increases in circulating total leukocytes and neutrophils, with significant differences between groups after recovery. Adrenaline, glucose, and lactate levels increased after exercise, with higher increases in the caffeine group. Exercise induced significant increases in IL-6 and IL-10 plasma levels, with higher increases in the caffeine group. Caffeine supplementation induced higher increases in oxidative stress markers after the competition.

Caffeine supplementation induced higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in response to exercise, enhancing the anti-inflammatory response.

### Caffeine citrate [^112WfRhF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of caffeine. Therefore, caffeine has the potential to interact with drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2, or induce CYP1A2.

Few data exist on drug interactions with caffeine in preterm neonates. Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs that are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g. cimetidine and ketoconazole), and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g. phenobarbital and phenytoin).

Caffeine administered concurrently with ketoprofen reduced urine volume in four healthy volunteers. The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known.

Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates. The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115gZyP6]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnancy symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and aversions to smells and taste, are more common in healthy pregnancies. Women with healthy pregnancies are more likely to decrease their caffeine consumption in response to these symptoms, and there is a suggestion that such symptoms can partly account for the relationship between caffeine intake and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight. Nonetheless, in a recent large cohort study by Sengpiel et al., the observation that higher maternal caffeine intake was associated with a higher risk of small for gestational age (SGA) was not affected by adjustment for nausea. Furthermore, in the CARE study, nausea and vomiting in pregnancy were not associated with fetal growth restriction and did not modify the association between maternal caffeine intake and fetal growth restriction.

Thus, the results of the original studies do not suggest that confounding explains the association between caffeine intake and low birth weight. Nevertheless, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out in observational studies.

In addition to the methodological limitations of the original studies, publication bias can affect the results of meta-analyses. In our meta-analysis, statistical tests for publication bias or the funnel plot did not suggest publication bias, but this type of bias can never be fully ruled out.

We assumed a linear relationship in our dose–response analysis as there was no evidence of departure from linearity. Also, our analysis based on categories of caffeine intake suggested a graded association between caffeine intake and the risk of low birth weight.

### Serum caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations and menstrual cycle function: Correlations with beverage intakes and associations with race, reproductive hormones, and anovulation in the BioCycle Study [^113tPYUY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Clinicians often recommend limiting caffeine intake when attempting to conceive; however, few studies have evaluated the associations between caffeine exposure and menstrual cycle function, and no previous studies have assessed biological dose via well-timed serum measurements.

- **Objectives**: We assessed the relation between caffeine and its metabolites and reproductive hormones in a healthy premenopausal cohort and evaluated potential effect modification by race.

- **Design**: Participants (n = 259) were followed for up to two menstrual cycles and provided fasting blood specimens up to eight times per cycle. Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between serum caffeine biomarkers and geometric mean reproductive hormones, while Poisson regression was used to assess the risk of sporadic anovulation.

- **Results**: The highest compared to the lowest serum caffeine tertile was associated with lower total testosterone [27.9 ng/dL (95% CI: 26.7, 29.0 ng/dL) compared with 29.1 ng/dL (95% CI: 27.9, 30.3 ng/dL), respectively] and free testosterone [0.178 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.171, 0.185 ng/dL) compared with 0.186 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.179, 0.194 ng/dL), respectively] after adjustment for age, race, percentage of body fat, daily vigorous exercise, perceived stress, depression, dietary factors, and alcohol intake. The highest tertiles compared to the lowest tertiles of caffeine and paraxanthine were also associated with reduced risk of anovulation [adjusted RRs (aRRs): 0.39 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.87) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.87), respectively].

### The comparison of low and standard dose ACTH and glucagon stimulation tests in the evaluation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in healthy adults [^115oZWcm]. Pituitary (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the HPA axis remains challenging due to varying sensitivities and stimulation efficiencies of dynamic tests, absence of standard assays for cortisol measurement, and limited data on the effects of age and gender on HPA axis evaluation results with different dynamic tests. This study aimed to compare 1 μg ACTH, 250 μg ACTH, and glucagon tests for evaluating the HPA axis. The study included 55 healthy individuals (28 men, 27 women), with 10–12 volunteers from each decade between 20 and 70 years.

- **Methods**: The low dose short synacthen test (1 μg ACTH), standard dose short synacthen test (250 μg ACTH), and glucagon tests were performed consecutively.

- **Results**: The mean peak cortisol response to the standard dose ACTH stimulation test was significantly higher than those observed in the low dose ACTH and glucagon stimulation tests. There was no significant difference in the mean peak cortisol responses between the low dose ACTH and glucagon tests. Mean peak cortisol responses did not significantly differ across different age or sex groups.

- **Data**: The lowest peak cortisol responses after low dose ACTH and glucagon tests were 12.5 and 9.1 μg/dl, respectively, in volunteers who all exhibited cortisol responses higher than 20 μg/dl after the standard dose ACTH test. The lowest cortisol responses during 250 μg ACTH, 1 μg ACTH, and glucagon tests were 20.1, 12.5, and 9.1 μg/dl, respectively, in a known group of healthy individuals.

- **Conclusion**: Considering appropriate hormonal cut-off levels for each test appears reasonable.

### Inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion by caffeine in human parathyroid cells [^116ytovC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Caffeine is a highly consumed psychoactive substance present in our daily drinks. Independent studies have reported associations between caffeine consumption, low bone mineral density, urinary calcium loss, and impaired bone development in vitro and in vivo. Calcium (Ca(2+)), vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are critical regulators of bone remodeling. A possible association between caffeine and parathyroid gland function has been suggested in the literature.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Effects of caffeine on PTH secretion and Ca(2+) levels were determined by batch incubation and Fura-2, respectively, in pathological parathyroid cells. Protein expressions were studied by western blot and immunohistochemistry in normal and parathyroid adenoma tissues. Alterations in gene expressions of adenosine receptor A1 (ADORA1) and A2 (ADORA2A) and PTH were quantified by PCR; intracellular cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity were analyzed by an antibody-based assay.

- **Results**: We studied physiological concentrations of caffeine ranging from 1 to 50 μM and found that 50 μM caffeine caused a significant decrease in PTH secretion and PTH gene expression. This decrease occurred parallel with a decrease in the intracellular cAMP level, protein kinase A activity, and ADORA1 gene expression, indicating a possible causal relationship. The intracellular level of Ca(2+) was unaffected even by high concentrations of caffeine. Protein expressions demonstrated two main targets for caffeine — ADORA1 and ADORA2A.

A physiological high dose of caffeine inhibits PTH secretion and gene expression in human parathyroid cells, suggesting a possible interaction between caffeine and parathyroid gland function.

### Role of the central ascending neurotransmitter systems in the psychostimulant effects of caffeine [^1179WoP8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Caffeine is the most consumed psychoactive drug in the world. It is a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist that targets mainly adenosine A1 and A2A receptors in the brain. Similar to classical psychostimulants, caffeine produces motor-activating, reinforcing, and arousing effects. This is due to caffeine's ability to counteract multiple effects of adenosine in the central ascending neurotransmitter systems.

Motor and reinforcing effects depend on caffeine's ability to release pre- and postsynaptic brakes that adenosine imposes on the ascending dopaminergic system. By targeting A1-A2A receptor heteromers in striatal glutamatergic terminals and A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals (presynaptic brake), caffeine induces glutamate-dependent and glutamate-independent release of dopamine. These presynaptic effects of caffeine are potentiated by the release of the postsynaptic brake imposed by antagonistic interactions in the striatal A2A-D2 and A1-D1 receptor heteromers.

Arousing effects of caffeine depend on blocking multiple inhibitory mechanisms that adenosine, as an endogenous sleep-promoting substance, exerts on the multiply interconnected ascending arousal systems. These mechanisms include a direct A1-receptor mediated modulation of the corticopetal basal forebrain system and an indirect A2A-receptor mediated modulation of the hypothalamic histaminergic and orexinergic systems.
