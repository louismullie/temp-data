## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with several small, well-demarcated depigmented patches on her hands and face. She reports that the patches have increased in size and number over the past two months. She is distressed about the appearance of her skin and says it is affecting her confidence at work. She has been using topical corticosteroids as prescribed for six weeks, but has noticed no improvement. The GP is confident that the diagnosis is vitiligo.

Based on current guideline recommendations, should this patient be referred to a specialist, and if so, what are the indications for referral in her case?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 28-year-old woman with progressive vitiligo on visible sites, significant psychosocial impact, and no response to six weeks of topical corticosteroids should be referred to a specialist, and what the guideline-based indications for referral are in her case. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it meets established referral triggers. Then, I should verify the guideline criteria for referral and map them to her features. Next, I will consider what specialty and why, and what to do while awaiting referral. Finally, I should confirm documentation needs and counseling points to ensure the referral is appropriate and actionable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and why it matters. She has active, progressive vitiligo on the hands and face, has experienced worsening over two months, reports substantial psychosocial distress affecting confidence at work, and has had no improvement after six weeks of topical corticosteroids, which places her in a category where escalation and specialist input are indicated rather than continued primary care monotherapy alone [^116G7zJY] [^112NCNGm].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-based indications for referral so I don't jump to conclusions. The British Association of Dermatologists recommends referral to a healthcare professional experienced in vitiligo management when there is diagnostic uncertainty, rapid progression, significant psychosocial impact, or failure to respond to topical therapy, and this patient clearly meets at least three of those four triggers, which independently justify referral [^116G7zJY].

> I will now examine each trigger against her presentation. Rapid progression is evident with new and enlarging patches over two months, significant psychosocial impact is explicitly reported and is a recognized burden in vitiligo, especially on visible sites, and failure to respond to topical therapy is present after six weeks of corticosteroids without improvement. Diagnostic uncertainty is not a concern here because the GP is confident in the diagnosis, but the other three are sufficient [^116G7zJY] [^112ppGH2] [^112NCNGm].

> Hold on, I should verify the appropriate specialty and the rationale. Dermatology is the correct specialty given the need for advanced therapies such as narrowband UVB phototherapy, combination regimens, and consideration of systemic options in rapidly progressive disease, along with standardized outcome assessment and access to psychological support when indicated, all of which align with BAD guidance and contemporary reviews of vitiligo management pathways [^116G7zJY] [^112YRiAF] [^111SKe9k].

> Next, I should review what to do while awaiting referral so we don't leave her without support. I need to ensure we document baseline disease extent with photographs, counsel on sun protection with high-SPF, broad-spectrum sunscreen, consider vitamin D assessment if sun avoidance is significant, and offer camouflage resources and psychological support given her distress, as these are all recommended elements of holistic care that can proceed in parallel with referral [^113wYw9e] [^114K7ozh] [^113QT5wh] [^115YUo9W] [^111s31Kx].

> But wait, what if the GP is considering escalating topical therapy alone instead of referring. I should double-check the expected timeline for topical response and when to declare failure. BAD advises reassessing topical treatments every 3 to 6 months, yet six weeks without any improvement, particularly with active disease on visible sites and psychosocial impact, still warrants referral rather than prolonged empiric topical therapy, especially when phototherapy or combination strategies may be more appropriate next steps [^1141BsYG] [^116G7zJY].

> I need to ensure the referral is framed correctly. The letter should explicitly state the indication as failure of topical therapy, rapid progression, and significant psychosocial impact, include a concise clinical summary, note the lack of response to potent topical corticosteroids, and request assessment for phototherapy and consideration of systemic options if activity continues, which aligns with BAD referral triggers and management principles for active vitiligo [^116G7zJY] [^112YRiAF].

> In summary, yes, she should be referred to dermatology now because she meets multiple guideline-endorsed referral criteria: rapid progression, significant psychosocial impact on visible sites, and failure to respond to appropriate topical therapy. While awaiting specialist input, continue supportive measures including photography, sun protection, vitamin D assessment as indicated, camouflage support, and psychological referral if distress is moderate to severe [^116G7zJY] [^113wYw9e] [^114K7ozh] [^113QT5wh] [^115YUo9W] [^111s31Kx].

This patient should be **referred to dermatology** because she has **rapidly progressive vitiligo** on visible sites with **significant psychosocial impact** and no response to six weeks of topical corticosteroids. Current guidelines indicate referral for **rapid progression**, **significant psychosocial impact**, or **failure of topical therapy**. Dermatology can offer phototherapy, calcineurin inhibitors, or systemic options to stabilize disease and improve repigmentation, and can coordinate psychological support. While awaiting referral, continue topical therapy, add calcineurin inhibitor if not already used, and provide sun protection and camouflage counseling.

## Indications for specialist referral in vitiligo

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2021 guidelines provide clear indications for referral to a specialist for vitiligo management:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: If the diagnosis is uncertain or atypical features are present.
- **Rapid progression**: If the disease is rapidly progressing.
- **Significant psychosocial impact**: If the condition significantly affects the patient's quality of life or psychological well-being.
- **Failure of topical therapy**: If there is no response to topical treatments after an adequate trial.

---

## Application to the patient's case

The patient presents with **rapidly progressive vitiligo** on visible sites (hands and face), significant psychosocial distress affecting her confidence at work, and no improvement after six weeks of topical corticosteroids. These features meet **multiple BAD criteria** for specialist referral:

- **Rapid progression**: The patches have increased in size and number over two months.
- **Significant psychosocial impact**: The patient reports distress and reduced confidence at work.
- **Failure of topical therapy**: No improvement after six weeks of topical corticosteroids.

---

## Benefits of specialist referral

Referral to a dermatologist offers several advantages:

- **Advanced therapies**: Access to phototherapy (narrowband UVB), topical calcineurin inhibitors, and systemic treatments for rapid progression or extensive disease.
- **Psychological support**: Referral to psychological services for moderate-to-severe distress, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
- **Comprehensive care**: Coordinated management of disease activity, repigmentation, and quality of life.

---

## Recommended specialist interventions

Upon referral, the dermatologist may consider the following interventions based on current guidelines and evidence:

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Narrowband UVB phototherapy | - Extensive or progressive vitiligo <br/> - Inadequate response to topical therapy | High [^112YRiAF] [^11675B7N] |
| Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus) | - Sensitive areas (face, eyelids, genitals) <br/> - Alternative to corticosteroids | High [^114hf543] [^115YxeeY] |
| Systemic corticosteroids (e.g. oral betamethasone) | Rapidly progressive vitiligo | Moderate [^116ztUB3] [^113dJS7F] |
| Psychological support (CBT) | Moderate-to-severe psychological distress | High [^111s31Kx] [^115h8Wvm] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's rapidly progressive vitiligo, significant psychosocial impact, and lack of response to topical corticosteroids, **specialist referral to dermatology is indicated**. This will enable access to advanced therapies and psychological support to stabilize disease activity, promote repigmentation, and improve quality of life. While awaiting referral, continue topical therapy, consider adding a calcineurin inhibitor, and provide sun protection and camouflage counseling.

Discussion

Vitiligo has traditionally been given a relatively low priority in the dermatology research agenda, as shown by the number and quality of studies on vitiligo to date. The updated systematic reviewis helpful in identifying many important research gaps for clinical trials, but these have come largely from the research community, and may not reflect the questions that patients and clinicians have.

Vitiligo is a common skin disorder that results in depigmentation. With the appropriate management, many patients can minimize disease progression, attain repigmentation, and achieve cosmetically pleasing results. There are numerous medical and surgical treatments aimed at repigmentation; therapies for depigmentation are available for patients with recalcitrant or advanced disease. The use of cosmetics at all stages of treatment may be vital to the patient's quality of life. Understanding all the available options helps choose the appropriate treatment plan and tailor it to your patient. Part II of this two-part series on vitiligo discusses the indications for, evidence behind, and adverse effects associated with many of the therapies used for vitiligo. Both conventional medical and surgical options are discussed in addition to several alternative and promising new therapies.

### Guideline for the diagnosis and management of vitiligo [^114WsDzi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

This detailed and user-friendly guideline for the diagnosis and management of vitiligo in children and adults aims to give high quality clinical advice, based on the best available evidence and expert consensus, taking into account patient choice and clinical expertise. The guideline was devised by a structured process and is intended for use by dermatologists and as a resource for interested parties including patients. Recommendations and levels of evidence have been graded according to the method developed by the Scottish Inter-Collegiate Guidelines Network. Where evidence was lacking, research recommendations were made. The types of vitiligo, process of diagnosis in primary and secondary care, and investigation of vitiligo were assessed. Treatments considered include offering no treatment other than camouflage cosmetics and sunscreens, the use of topical potent or highly potent corticosteroids, of vitamin D analogues, and of topical calcineurin inhibitors, and depigmentation with p-(benzyloxy)phenol. The use of systemic treatment, e.g. corticosteroids, ciclosporin and other immunosuppressive agents was analyzed. Phototherapy was considered, including narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), psoralen with ultraviolet A (UVA), and khellin with UVA or UVB, along with combinations of topical preparations and various forms of UV. Surgical treatments that were assessed include full-thickness and split skin grafting, mini (punch) grafts, autologous epidermal cell suspensions, and autologous skin equivalents. The effectiveness of cognitive therapy and psychological treatments was considered. Therapeutic algorithms using grades of recommendation and levels of evidence have been produced for children and for adults with vitiligo.

Results

Stages 2 and 3: Consultation and collation

Of the 2303 surveys circulated, 461 (20%) were returned. This resulted in 1427 questions about vitiligo. Non-treatment questions (n = 767), about the natural history of vitiligo, its aetiology and prevention, were excluded.

The response rate for members of the Vitiligo Society was 24% (307/1268) and for BAD/UK DCTN members was 14% (119/835). Sixty-six per cent of responses (302/461) were from patients, 31% (142/461) were from healthcare professionals, and 3% were from other sources. More women responded than men (53% women, 30% men, 17% did not specify), and most were aged 30–60 years (8% < 30 years, 50% 30–60 years, 25% > 60 years, 17% did not specify).

Overall, 660 uncertainties that specifically related to the treatment of vitiligo were gathered during the consultation stage. Thirty-one per cent were from healthcare professionals (206/660), 48.5% were from patients (320/660) and 20.5% were unknown (134/660). An additional 58 treatment uncertainties were identified from the BAD guideline and the updated Cochrane systematic review. The resulting 718 uncertainties were refined into a 'long-list' of 93 treatment uncertainties, which were used for the ranking exercise.

Materials and methods

The vitiligo PSP was coordinated at the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, with numerous stakeholders from professional organizations and patient support groups. The aim of the vitiligo PSP was to reduce the number of uncertainties surrounding the treatment of this condition and to steer future research to questions of importance both to people living with the disease and to people treating the disease.

The vitiligo PSP adopted the methods advocated by the JLAwhich were refined to meet the needs of this particular PSP. The vitiligo PSP had five stages (see Fig. 1 for a summary of the vitiligo PSP methodology).

Fig 1
Summary of methods used by the vitiligo priority setting partnership. BAD, British Association of Dermatologists; DUETs, Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments.

Stage 1: Initiation

The aim of this stage was to establish the vitiligo PSP by raising awareness, and identifying and engaging potential stakeholders.

Organizations approached during this stage were professional bodies and patient support groups: British Association of Dermatologists (BAD), UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network (UK DCTN), NHS Evidence – Skin Disorders, Cochrane Skin Group, British Dermatological Nursing Group, Changing Faces, British Red Cross Camouflage Service, Skin Care Campaign, Primary Care Dermatology Society, Vitiligo European Task Force, British Association of Skin Camouflage and Vitiligo Society. Individual researchers, dermatologists, specialist nurses and psychologists with a special interest in vitiligo were also informed. Our research group, called the Steering Group, included 12 members with knowledge and interest in vitiligo. (For details on the Steering Group members please see Acknowledgments section).

Stage 2: Consultation

The aim of this stage was to collect treatment uncertainties.

An online and paper survey was undertaken that encouraged patients and clinicians to submit their questions about the treatment of vitiligo. Paper copies of the questionnaire were sent to the Vitiligo Society (n = 1268) and to the BAD (n = 835). E-mails were sent to members of the UK DCTN (n = 500), and details of the project (with links to the online survey) were advertised on the websites and in the newsletters of the relevant organizations listed above.

Additional treatment uncertainties were identified from existing sources of current evidence: the updated Cochrane systematic review 'Interventions for vitiligo'and the BAD guideline for diagnosis and management of vitiligo.

### The voice of the patient vitiligo… [^1176HyXk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. 1 There is no cure for vitiligo, and there are no FDA-approved treatments for repigmentation of vitiligo lesions. Treatments to attempt repigmentation include topical corticosteroids and psoralen and. indicating the most bothersome aspects of vitiligo were the location and amount or extent of depigmentation. Others reported skin sensitivity and loss of hair color as bothersome aspects of their vitiligo. Although participants in this meeting may not fully represent the diverse population living with vitiligo, the perspectives they shared reflected a diverse set of experiences with vitiligo symptoms and. The input from the meeting and docket comments provided rich detail on the impact of vitiligo on patients.

The physical, emotional, and social toll vitiligo takes on daily life, along with the need for new treatment options, emerged within the key themes:

- Participants described depigmentation and skin sensitivity as the most burdensome aspects of. discussed topical corticosteroids, PUVA and other light therapies, and other therapeutic options such as dietary modifications and corrective cosmetics. Their ability to manage their vitiligo was generally limited, with varying levels of success, and they stressed the need for a long-lasting treatment option that could offer permanent repigmentation. They also expressed. the importance of her support system and positive environment.
- A 51-year-old African American woman, diagnosed with vitiligo at age 43, described the depigmentation that occurred over 85% of her body within a short period of time. The emotional effects of her vitiligo included depression and suicidal ideation. and itching that accompanied her depigmentation.

She does not leave the house or see anyone without applying corrective cosmetics, which she described as tedious and time-consuming. The panelists' statements provided a detailed account of the physical and emotional burden of living with vitiligo daily. Their perspectives were further reflected in the subsequent large-group discussion. were 1) location of depigmentation, 2) amount or extent of depigmentation, and 3) skin sensitivity. Some participants experienced rapid depigmentation over many areas of their body, while others described small, depigmented spots that did not change for several years. Some participants felt their. vitiligo was well-managed, while others chose to no longer pursue treatments, either because of acceptance or lost hope for effective management of their vitiligo. Depigmentation All participants experienced some amount of depigmentation, although the location and extent of depigmentation varied.

For most participants, depigmentation was present on their skin, but some also. 7 had depigmentation of their hair. Several participants described that their depigmentation started as a small spot on one area that then spread to other areas. One participant described an experience with vitiligo that remained constant for several years, but then spread suddenly: "In my 40s, I had a very. small spot. Once I got over 60, it exploded. And it exploded literally overnight. One morning I woke up, my forehead was gone. One morning I woke up, I had spots all over my arms. " Another participant stated, "Age 48, I saw white spots on my hands in September 2019. Not long ago. Vitiligo is. spreading fast all over my body. Now I look like I almost lost more than 75 percent of my color. " One expressed a gradual progression of depigmentation, "It started as a small spot on my hand, and it was really tiny.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in Japan [^116PKbTX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired pigment disorder in which depigmented macules result from the loss of melanocytes from the involved regions of skin and hair. The color dissimilarity on the cosmetically sensitive regions frequently induces quality of life impairment and high willingness to pay for treatment in patients with vitiligo. The Vitiligo Japanese Task Force was organized to overcome this situation and to cooperate with the Vitiligo Global Issues Consensus Conference. This guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in Japan is proposed to improve the circumstances of Japanese individuals with vitiligo. Its contents include information regarding the diagnosis, pathogenesis, evaluation of disease severity and effectiveness of treatment, and evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo. The therapeutic algorithm based on the proposed recommendation is designed to cure and improve the affected lesions and quality of life of individuals with vitiligo.

### The long road to valid outcomes in vitiligo [^115P3nww]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to reach a consensus on what and how to measure, a next step was to achieve consensus on the definition of successful repigmentation. In other words, when is the treatment effective in terms of repigmentation? In previous studies, the definitions of 'successful repigmentation' varied from 'any repigmentation' to 100% repigmentation. In the past, these definitions were typically defined by physicians, but it is obvious that patients should have the most important voice in this matter.

In this issue of the BJD, Eleftheriadou et al. present the results of a consensus study on the definition of 'successful repigmentation' from the patients' perspective. 7 In three different focus groups involving a total of 73 patients with vitiligo, consensus was reached that 80% repigmentation of a target lesion is regarded successful by patients. Moreover, patients considered the face, neck and hands to be the most important sites of their bodies in terms of achieving satisfactory results. Also, patients recommended an objective and a subjective scale to measure repigmentation. Remarkably, this consensus was unanimous with a 100% agreement.

Does that mean that treatments where we anticipate much less than 80% improvement should not be started at all? It is wise not to jump too quickly to conclusions; for individual patients, substantially lower repigmentation rates may be acceptable or even successful. Other patients may just want to stop the progression of their vitiligo instead of aiming for repigmentation. 8 In the age of 'shared decision making' we need to discuss expectations and anticipated outcomes with our patients and achieve the best possible management of their skin condition. Inevitably, this study raises new questions and now needs to be repeated in other settings and other populations. These results also clarify that our treatments are not nearly as effective as patients require today. Given the great impact vitiligo may have on patient's quality of life, we need to follow a course for more effective treatments but also for valid outcomes in vitiligo.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in children [^11278xX9]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common inflammatory skin disease with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5% to 2.0% of the population. In the pediatric population, the exact prevalence of vitiligo is unknown, although many studies state that most cases of vitiligo are acquired early in life. The disease is disfiguring, with a major psychological impact on children and their parents. Half of vitiligo cases have a childhood onset, needing thus a treatment approach that will minimize treatment side effects while avoiding psychological impacts. Management of vitiligo should take into account several factors, including extension, psychological impact, and possible associations with other autoimmune diseases. This review discusses the epidemiology of vitiligo and outlines the various clinical presentations associated with the disorder and their differential diagnosis. In addition, the pathophysiology and genetic determinants, the psychological impact of vitiligo, and management strategies are reviewed.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to use the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process to create high-quality context-specific CPGs and to formulate treatment algorithms and referral pathways for GPs. CPGs were created for the management of acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, androgenic alopecia, vitiligo, lichen planus, melasma, urticaria and drug allergy. These guidelines focused on early disease identification, diagnosis, primary care management, and timely specialist referral.

The purpose of creating these CPGs was to improve the quality of primary dermatological care and decrease the burden of skin diseases. Dermatological diseases are among the leading causes of non-fatal diseases. Studies done in Pakistan showed that there is a high burden of untreated dermatological diseases within the population, with little access to tertiary care facilities.

For the system to work successfully, GPs must be able to treat basic dermatological diseases and identify and refer patients with more advanced or complicated pathologies, as they are often the first point of contact. However, multiple studies have found that GPs are unable to manage dermatological complaints as effectively, as their clinical diagnostic abilities are low when compared with specialists or dermatologists. The knowledge gap regarding common skin conditions in GPs results in incorrect diagnosis and treatment, and delays in referral, which increases the burden on the healthcare system. Hence, the formed CPGs provided a set of recommendations which will help to bridge the knowledge gap and standardise patient care. By synthesising and converting evidence into recommendations, detecting relevant evidence-to-practice gaps, reducing expensive and avoidable adverse events, enhancing patient outcomes, and supporting collaborative decision-making processes, these CPGs have the potential to improve healthcare quality.

### Future research into the treatment of vitiligo: where should our priorities lie? Results of the vitiligo priority setting partnership [^114E1qgp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

To conclude, we wish to note that by recommending the above we are not commenting on the legitimacy of the interventions that have been prioritized, but are reporting what clinicians and patients identified as important research topics in order to meet their needs.

Reflections on the process

One might argue that the response rate for the vitiligo PSP was rather low (consultation stage response rate 20%); however, the number of participants by far exceeded our expectations based on previous PSPs convened by the JLA. This was due mainly to our collaboration and networking with the UK DCTN and the Vitiligo Society. We believe that the innovative and unusual nature of this project means that it is inappropriate to apply the same criteria for the response rate of this PSP as for other surveys. Indeed, the vitiligo PSP far exceeded our original sample size estimates for the number of participants at each stage, and had approximately double the number of participants who took part in previous PSPs.

In order to inform future PSPs, it is helpful to present some of the key challenges that we faced as two recommendations.

Recommendation 1. We recommend that information about the existing research evidence for the different treatments is presented in a patient-friendly format at the beginning of the PSP. This would allow all participants to engage in the process more effectively, regardless of their background, experience or levels of expertise.
Recommendation 2. Most of the uncertainties (during consultation) were broad and nonspecific, or did not specify the comparator, the duration of treatment or the population, when others from the research community were very focused. For that reason, we recommend keeping the uncertainties as broad as possible to allow flexibility but sufficiently narrow to ensure the question is meaningful. Therefore we have developed a standard format for different types of questions submitted (Table 2).

Table 2
Structure used to refine the questions into indicative uncertainties

Implementation of the results

The next step of our research group is to conduct a feasibility study on one of the top 10 uncertainties by working with the UK DCTN.

We are hopeful that by publishing this list of important treatment uncertainties, we will prompt other research groups and pharmaceutical companies to take a fresh look at vitiligo research and the needs of patients with vitiligo and to bring unity to the international efforts into the treatment of vitiligo.

Finally, we would recommend that researchers continue to work with patients and clinicians in meaningful partnerships in developing their future research activity, in line with current guidelines.

Countries in the so-called "Western" world, especially in Europe, witnessed a dramatic change in ethnic backgrounds of their populations starting in the last decennia of the last century. This had repercussions on various aspects of our society, including medical practice. In dermatology for instance, pigmentary disorders are seen more often, and the clinical pictures and their impact on patients are different from what doctors and researchers are used to and trained for. In this article, the experience from the Netherlands Institute for Pigment Disorders and the multicenter designed Netherlands guideline on vitiligo are described and the importance of the patient's point of view, as can be measured by patient reported outcomes like quality of life, is emphasized.

Is there a need for a new service?

Site investigators indicated that combination treatment for vitiligo might be delivered within broader dermatology phototherapy provision, and some indicated that they were already reusing devices in this type of setting for the treatment of vitiligo. The provision of medical physics services to maintain devices and specialist nurses to support home use was central to this.

However, commissioners considered it unlikely that dedicated services for vitiligo of this kind would be commissioned. They indicated that vitiligo might not be prioritized in commissioning discussions due to a perceived lack of demand from patients and HCPs for new services:

Commissioner 4: ' I'm not getting any complaints for example about the services that we provide. Like GPs aren't coming to me saying, we're not happy with this. As far as our GPs are concerned, they're getting a good service because their patients aren't complaining to them. It's not coming up on our monitoring in terms of performance'.
Commissioners also indicated that vitiligo might be dismissed as a cosmetic (rather than clinical) problem:
Commissioner 2: '… it could fall under cosmetic if it was on an area other than hands and face, which means that this wouldn't necessarily be a priority'. Commissioner 7: ' You do have a cosmetic exclusion policy. And that… that presumably will catch vitiligo within it'. Commissioner 3: '… some people see it is as just a cosmetic problem'.

All the uncertainties identified by the PSPs are added to the Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments (DUETs) in order to provide reference for funding bodies and researchers. It is known that the research funding bodies in the U.K. systematically scan important research resources to identify evidence gaps and make recommendations for research. This includes Cochrane systematic reviews and more recently DUETs.

DUETs has been established in the U.K. to publish uncertainties about the effects of treatment which cannot currently be answered by referring to reliable up-to-date systematic reviews of existing research evidence. A treatment uncertainty exists when 'no up-to-date systematic review exists, or up-to-date systematic reviews show that uncertainty continues', i.e. more research needs to be done to establish the effectiveness and safety of an existing or innovative intervention.

### Vitiligo: a comprehensive overview part I. introduction, epidemiology, quality of life, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, associations, histopathology, etiology, and work-up [^113Acv1E]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of unknown etiology that is clinically characterized by the development of white macules related to the selective loss of melanocytes. The prevalence of the disease is around 1% in the United States and in Europe, but ranges from less than 0.1% to greater than 8% worldwide. A recorded predominance of women may reflect their greater willingness to express concern about cosmetically relevant issues. Half of all patients develop the disease before 20 years of age. Onset at an advanced age occurs but is unusual, and should raise concerns about associated diseases, such as thyroid dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and alopecia areata. Generalized vitiligo is the most common clinical presentation and often involves the face and acral regions. The course of the disease is unpredictable and the response to treatment varies. Depigmentation may be the source of severe psychological distress, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of psychiatric morbidity. Part I of this two-part series describes the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and various hypotheses for the pathogenesis of vitiligo based on past and current research.

Stage 4: Ranking exercise (interim prioritization exercise)

In total, 230 people (patients 72%, health care professionals 23%, did not specify 5%) responded to the ranking exercise, submitting 638 individual votes. Each participant could vote for up to three of their favourite uncertainties. Nineteen paper voters were excluded as they submitted more than three favourite topics. The number of votes per uncertainty ranged from 49 to 0 (median 5).

The demographic characteristics of participants in the ranking exercise were broadly similar to those in the consultation stage (63% were women, and 55% were aged between 30 and 60 years). Of those who specified their ethnicity (n = 127), 42% were white and 12.6% were from black and ethnic minorities.

As more patients participated in the ranking exercise than healthcare professionals, the Steering Group considered the ranked priorities of patients and healthcare professionals separately.

At the end of this stage, a short-list of 23 uncertainties was identified for the final prioritization workshop.

### Future research into the treatment of vitiligo: where should our priorities lie? Results of the vitiligo priority setting partnership [^111xoU9N]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is the most frequent depigmentation disorder of the skin and is cosmetically and psychologically devastating. A recently updated Cochrane systematic review 'Interventions for vitiligo' showed that the research evidence for treatment of vitiligo is poor, making it difficult to make firm recommendations for clinical practice.

Objectives

To stimulate and steer future research in the field of vitiligo treatment, by identifying the 10 most important research areas for patients and clinicians.

Methods

A vitiligo priority setting partnership was established including patients, healthcare professionals and researchers with an interest in vitiligo. Vitiligo treatment uncertainties were gathered from patients and clinicians, and then prioritized in a transparent process, using a methodology advocated by the James Lind Alliance.

Results

In total, 660 treatment uncertainties were submitted by 461 participants. These were reduced to a list of the 23 most popular topics through an online/paper voting process. The 23 were then prioritized at a face-to-face workshop in London. The final list of the top 10 treatment uncertainties included interventions such as systemic immunosuppressants, topical treatments, light therapy, melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogues, gene therapy, and the impact of psychological interventions on the quality of life of patients with vitiligo.

Conclusions

The top 10 research areas for the treatment of vitiligo provide guidance for researchers and funding bodies, to ensure that future research answers questions that are important both to clinicians and to patients.

### International initiative for outcomes (INFO) for vitiligo: workshops with patients with vitiligo on repigmentation [^1167Z5Hj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no cure or firm clinical recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo. One of the main issues is the heterogeneity of outcome measures used in randomized controlled trials for vitiligo.

Objectives

To define successful repigmentation from the patients' point of view and to propose how and when repigmentation should be evaluated in clinical trials in vitiligo.

Methods

We conducted three workshops with patients with vitiligo and their parents or caregivers. Workshop 1 was held at World Vitiligo Day (Detroit, MI), workshop 2 at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and workshop 3 at the Vitiligo and Pigmentation Institute of Southern California, University of California.

Results

Seventy-three participants were recruited. Consensus on the following questions was achieved unanimously: (i) the definition of 'successful repigmentation' was 80–100% of repigmentation of a target lesion and (ii) both an objective and a subjective scale to measure repigmentation should be used.

Conclusions

This was the largest patients' outcomes workshop. We followed the guidance from the CSG-COUSIN and the Vitiligo Global Issues Consensus Group. Our recommendations to use percentage of repigmentation quartiles (0–25%, 26–50%, 51–79%, 80–100%) and the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale are based on the best available current evidence. A limitation of the research is that the workshops were conducted only in the U.S. A., due to pre-existing organisational support and the availability of funding.

### New discoveries in the pathogenesis and classification of vitiligo [^112DsKqP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease that progressively destroys melanocytes in the skin, resulting in the appearance of patchy depigmentation. This disfiguring condition frequently affects the face and other visible areas of the body, which can be psychologically devastating. The onset of vitiligo often occurs in younger individuals and progresses for life, resulting in a heavy burden of disease and decreased quality of life. Presentation patterns of vitiligo vary, and recognition of these patterns provides both diagnostic and prognostic clues. Recent insights into disease pathogenesis offer a better understanding of the natural history of the disease, its associations, and potential for future treatments. The first article in this continuing medical education series outlines typical and atypical presentations of vitiligo, how they reflect disease activity, prognosis, and response to treatment. Finally, we discuss disease associations, risk factors, and our current understanding of disease pathogenesis.

### Vitiligo [^112NCNGm]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Vitiligo, an acquired pigmentary disorder of unknown origin, is the most frequent cause of depigmentation worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 1%. The disorder can be psychologically devastating and stigmatising, especially in dark skinned individuals. Vitiligo is clinically characterised by the development of white macules due to the loss of functioning melanocytes in the skin or hair, or both. Two forms of the disease are well recognised: segmental and non-segmental vitiligo (the commonest form). To distinguish between these two forms is of prime importance because therapeutic options and prognosis are quite different. The importance of early treatment and understanding of the profound psychosocial effect of vitiligo will be emphasised throughout this Seminar.

### Shared decision-making for vitiligo [^115NAeW6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Linked Article: Shourick et al. Br J Dermatol 2021; 185:787–796. Vitiligo is a persistent or chronic condition in which areas of skin lose their normal pigment and become very pale. It is common, affecting about 1% of the world's population. Vitiligo affects men and women of all races equally, but is more noticeable in people with skin of colour. Treatment of vitiligo is often challenging and patients need to persist with treatment long term. Shared decision-making tools (SDMts) are visual aids that are developed to promote joint medical decision-making between physicians and patients. They may help patients better define what they would like to achieve in terms of treatment. In dermatology, various decision support tools have been developed but none for vitiligo. In this study a SDMt was developed and tested in 30 French and 10 US adult patients with vitiligo. The patients who took part in the study reported high satisfaction rates with the use of this tool during their consultations with clinicians. In conclusion, this SDMt for vitiligo can be used routinely in daily clinical practice, and may help patients to continue with treatment for longer. It is an important step towards patient-centred care for patients with vitiligo.

These issues are addressed in clinical studies aiming to evaluate safety and efficiency of novel treatments, improvements and modifications introduced to existing treatments, and to define predictors of treatment efficiency and their limitations. Here, results of recent (since year 2009) clinical studies in vitiligo field are overviewed, with the emphasis on their contribution to improved vitiligo management.

- one week of potent or very potent corticosteroids and at least 1 week off

- one week of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids alternating with ≥ 1 week of topical calcineurin inhibitor.

### Which outcomes should we measure in vitiligo? Results of a systematic review and a survey among patients and clinicians on outcomes in vitiligo trials [^111eZvBo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Relevant and reliable outcomes play a crucial role in the correct interpretation and comparison of the results of clinical trials. There is a lack of consensus around methods of assessment and outcome measures for vitiligo, which makes it difficult to compare results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and perform meta-analysis.

Objectives

To describe the heterogeneity in outcome measures used in published RCTs of vitiligo treatments, and to report the most desirable outcomes from patients' and clinicians' perspectives.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of outcome measures used in RCTs as well as a survey of the most desirable outcomes identified by patients and clinicians as part of a Vitiligo Priority Setting Partnership.

Results

Outcomes from 54 eligible trials were analysed and compared with outcomes suggested by patients and clinicians. In the systematic review, 25 different outcomes were reported. Only 22% of trials had clearly stated primary outcome measures. Repigmentation was the most frequently reported outcome in 96% of trials and was measured using 48 different scales. Only 9% of trials assessed quality of life. Thirteen per cent measured cessation of spreading of the disease and 17% of studies reported patients' opinions and satisfaction with the treatment. In contrast, out of 438 suggestions made by patients and clinicians, cosmetically acceptable repigmentation (rather than percentage of repigmentation) was the most desirable outcome (68%), followed by cessation of spread of vitiligo (15%), quality of life (8%) and maintenance of repigmentation (4%).

Conclusions

We propose that future vitiligo trials should include repigmentation, cosmetic acceptability of results, global assessment of the disease, quality of life, maintenance of repigmentation, stabilization of vitiligo and side-effects. International consensus among clinicians, researchers and patients is needed to establish an agreed core outcome set for future vitiligo trials.

### Medical and maintenance treatments for vitiligo [^111hUN1i]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Medical treatments alone, or in combination with phototherapy, are key approaches for treating nonsegmental vitiligo and, to a lesser extent, segmental vitiligo. The treatments are useful for halting disease progression and have been proven effective for inducing repigmentation and decreasing risk of relapses. Although the treatments have side effects and limitations, vitiligo often induces a marked decrease in quality of life and in most cases the risk:benefit ratio is in favor of an active approach. Systemic and topical agents targeting the pathways involved in loss of melanocytes and in differentiation of melanocyte stem cells should provide more effective approaches in the near future.

### Evidence-based management of vitiligo: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^114BeSVa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitiligo affects around 1% of the world's population. Despite it being relatively common, there is still no effective treatment. The objective of this study was to update the Cochrane systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for vitiligo. We carried out searches of a range of databases to October 2013 for RCTs of interventions for vitiligo regardless of language or publication status. At least two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data using data extraction forms approved by the Cochrane Skin Group. Our primary outcomes of interest were quality of life, > 75% repigmentation and adverse effects. We retrieved 96 studies, of which 39 were new studies, with an overall total of 4512 participants. Repigmentation was assessed in all studies, although only five reported on all three of our primary outcomes. Regarding our two secondary outcomes, six studies measured cessation of spread but none assessed long-term permanence of repigmentation at 2 years' follow-up. Most of the studies evaluated combination treatments, which generally showed better repigmentation than monotherapies. Of the new studies, seven were surgical interventions. The majority of the studies had fewer than 50 participants. The quality of the studies was poor to moderate at best. Very few studies specifically included children or participants with segmental vitiligo. Five years after the last update of this review, there are still important variations in study design and outcome measures in clinical trials for vitiligo, limiting the evidence for the efficacy of different therapeutic options. The best evidence from individual trials showed short-term benefit from topical corticosteroids and various forms of ultraviolet radiation combined with topical preparations. Long-term follow-up and patient-rated outcomes should be incorporated into study design, and more studies should assess psychological interventions.

Case 1

An 18-year-old woman contacted her general practitioner because of nausea and abdominal pain. She was previously well except vitiligo, which developed at 3 years of age. An elevated TSH value was found (20 mIE/L, range 0.35–4.9), and she was started on a replacement dose with L-thyroxine. Initially she felt better, but then her symptoms worsened, and she would often throw up after breakfast before going to school. She was referred to an endocrinologist who on suspicion of adrenal insufficiency tested adrenocortical function. In a morning sample he found a serum cortisol at 288 nmol/L (range 60–600), plasma ACTH 5.3 pmol/L (range < 11.6), plasma renin 55.8 mIE/L (range 4.4–46.1), and serum aldosterone at 75.1 pmol/L (range 49–1086), all in the normal range except a slightly elevated plasma renin. However, assay of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies revealed an extremely elevated value at > 5000 U/mL (range < 1.0).

Due to persisting symptoms, a standard 0.25 mg cosyntropin test was performed 6 months later. Cortisol climbed from 411 to 595 and 602 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. ACTH in the basal test was 10.1 pmol/L, renin 149 mIE/L, and aldosterone 90.4 pmol/L. TSH was still elevated, and the L-thyroxine dose was increased. She was also started on fludrocortisone since renin was now clearly elevated and aldosterone relatively low. She was also informed of the risk of overt adrenal insufficiency and prescribed cortisone acetate to use in case she got worse. Fludrocortisone improved her nausea and alleviated dizziness, but she still vomited at least twice a week.

During the next 6 months she moved to another city to start college studies. Her mother, who saw her occasionally, noted darkening of the skin. She was then referred to our hospital and when seen at the first appointment, ACTH levels were strikingly elevated (> 278 pmol/L). The corresponding morning cortisol was 209 nmol/L. A new cosyntropin test revealed serum cortisol at 233 nmol/L before and 234 and 225 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Daily cortisone acetate replacement was started. Review of her history revealed considerable salt craving.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^117SDH5e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the combination treatment of TCS plus NB‐UVB is relatively complex to manage and will not be suitable for all patients, we found that, in the absence of other treatment options, people with vitiligo and HCPs were positive about its potential. Given the economic challenges of commissioning new services, a 'mixed economy' model of provision (where people with vitiligo purchase or hire devices) may be worth considering, although this would need to be explored in more detail, by directly asking people with vitiligo about their likely willingness to pay in such a model. Regardless of how the NB‐UVB devices might be provided, concerns regarding the safe use of TCS and NB‐UVB mean that training, monitoring and ongoing support to those using combination treatment are essential. The need for medical physics support may mean that a regional service is more practical than a local one.

### Vitiligo. pathogenesis and treatment [^1128zQL3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired skin disorder caused by the disappearance of pigment cells from the epidermis that gives rise to well defined white patches which are often symmetrically distributed. The lack of melanin pigment makes the lesional skin more sensitive to sunburn. Vitiligo can be cosmetically disfiguring and it is a stigmatizing condition, leading to serious psychologic problems in daily life. It occurs worldwide in about 0.5% of the population and it occurs as frequently in males as it does in females. The cause is unknown, but might involve genetic factors, autoimmunity, neurologic factors, toxic metabolites, and lack of melanocyte growth factors. Since a causative (gene) treatment is not (yet) available, current modalities are directed towards stopping progression and to achieving repigmentation in order to repair the morphology and functional deficiencies of the depigmented skin areas. Many treatments have been used for some time; however; there are some new developments: narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B (311 nm) therapy, the combination of corticosteroid cream + UVA therapy, and the transplantation of autologous pigment cells in various modalities. In widespread vitiligo, residual pigment can be removed by depigmentation agents. Sunscreens, camouflage products, and good guidance may help the patient cope better with the disease.

### Phototherapy: the vitiligo management pillar [^1122TCGD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Phototherapy has been the mainstay of vitiligo therapy for several decades. A variety of wavelengths and modalities are available, but narrowband ultraviolet B remains the safest and most commonly used treatment. Acting on multiple steps in vitiligo pathogenesis, narrowband ultraviolet B is one of the few therapies that can effectively induce stabilization and stimulate repigmentation. Achievement of optimal results involves using a combination of appropriate treatment protocols, careful patient selection, and patient education to set expectations. Individual patient characteristics, including disease activity, vitiligo phenotype, lesion location, and skin phototype, should all be considered, along with combination therapies.

Stage 3: Collation

The aim of this stage was to create a 'long-list' of uncertainties by collating, refining submitted uncertainties and rewording similar questions. Questions on the aetiology, the natural history and prevention of the disease (non-treatment uncertainties) were excluded at this stage. Each collated uncertainty represented a broad area for research, rather than focusing on a specific research question. For example, the refined uncertainty 'How effective is ultraviolet B therapy when combined with creams or ointments in treating vitiligo?' includes combination of narrowband ultraviolet B with topical agents such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, vitamin D analogues etc. This was necessary in order to reduce the list of uncertainties to a manageable number.

Stage 4: Ranking exercise (Interim prioritization exercise)

The aim of the ranking exercise was to create a 'short-list' of uncertainties and to reduce their number to no more than 25. As the majority of participants from the consultation stage expressed a willingness to engage in the process further, the ranking exercise included all people who gave contact details during the consultation. It was also advertised on the websites and in the newsletters of relevant organizations, as per the consultation stage. In addition, advertisements and articles were placed in the Voice magazine for black and ethnic minorities, the British Dermatological Nursing Group magazineand the bulletin of the Primary Care Dermatology Societyto target specific groups that had been under-represented during the consultation stage.

Participants were asked to vote for their three favourite topics (three individual votes) online or using paper questionnaires by downloading them from our website or contacting the research team directly. The order in which uncertainties appeared on the survey was randomized in order to guard against response bias.

Stage 5: Final Prioritization Workshop

The aim of this final stage was to identify the top 10 most important treatment uncertainties for vitiligo by creating consensus through a face-to-face workshop of healthcare professionals and patients.

Participants of previous stages of the vitiligo PSP attended this workshop. Efforts were made to ensure that equal numbers of patients and healthcare professionals attended. The workshop was a full-day event, held at the London offices of the BAD on 25 March 2010.

Further details of the methods used during the vitiligo PSP are outlined in the James Lind Alliance guidebook.

### Psychosomatic aspects of vitiligo [^114mVQ2q]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a chronic common skin disease. The asymptomatic hypopigmented cutaneous lesions are considered by many health care professionals as a cosmetic problem only; however, vitiligo can have a major psychosocial impact on patients' lives. We review some of the factors responsible for this impact, such as the general public's wrong perception of the disease, feelings and emotional responses from patients, how stressful events can act as triggers of the disease, stigmatization experiences suffered by the patients, the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, the effects on relationships and sex life, how quality of life in adults and children is impaired, and how treatment can improve it.

Fig. 4
The 10 most frequent causes for referrals to biopsy, in-presence dermatologists, and back to physicians among patients who participated in the teletriage project from July 2017 to July 2018 in the city of São Paulo.

31% of the lesions were referred to in-person dermatologists. Benign proliferations (melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, and cysts) were among the top 10 diseases, accounting for 15% of this in-person dermatologist referral. Two infectious diseases, warts and molluscum, were also frequently referred to in-person dermatologists (10%). Acne, vitiligo, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis accounted for 15% of these referrals, and AK alone was responsible for 4%. We found that over 80% of the AK and warts, 56% of the epidermoid cysts, 33% of the acne and melanocytic nevus, 28% of the AD, 94% of the molluscum, 60% of psoriasis, and 78% of vitiligo patients were referred to in-person dermatologists.

The dermatoses most referred to general physicians were: xerosis (98%), solar lentigo (96%), seborrheic dermatitis (90%), melasma (88%), onychomycosis (88%), acrochordon/other benign neoplasia (88%), seborrheic keratosis (81%), atopic dermatitis (72%), and the melanocytic nevus (62%).

We also categorized the most frequent skin disorders according to age (Fig. 5). We observed that atopic dermatitis, xerosis, and melanocytic nevus were the major concerns in children up to 12 years of age. Adolescents and young adults (13–24 age group) mainly had acne, atopic dermatitis, xerosis, and melanocytic nevus. The adult population (25–64 age group) was the largest population in the study and showed many cases of melasma (in this study, a problem almost exclusively faced by adults) and melanocytic nevus. The population over 65 years of age reported seborrheic keratosis, solar lentigo, onychomycosis, and other benign proliferations such as epidermoid cysts and acrochordon.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^1118doBj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The trial demonstrated that for people with active, limited vitiligo, combination treatment with potent TCS and home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB offers a better treatment response than potent TCS alone. It also demonstrated that combination treatment offers better value for money than NB‐UVB or potent TCS used in isolation in the treatment of active, limited vitiligo.

However, there are uncertainties in how best to implement this treatment combination in clinical practice. The benefits of this treatment combination (home‐based treatment, which reduces hospital visits; localized treatment, which minimizes exposure of unaffected skin to NB‐UVB) may need to be balanced against safety concerns, the complexities of combining treatment regimens, and the practicalities of testing and providing equipment within existing care pathways.

Here we report summary findings of a process evaluation nested within the HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial. Evaluating the opinions of stakeholders [people with vitiligo, parents of children with vitiligo, health service commissioners, healthcare professionals (HCPs)] we addressed three specific questions: (i) Can combination treatment be used safely and effectively by people with vitiligo? (ii) Should combination treatment be made available as routine clinical care? and (iii) Can combination treatment be integrated within current healthcare provision?

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^115jFj6i]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitiligo causes depigmented patches of skin and can have a considerable impact on quality of life. Two of the most commonly used vitiligo treatments are topical corticosteroid (TCS) and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB‐UVB). In the UK, people have mixed experiences of obtaining treatments for vitiligo, including TCS.NB‐UVB treatment is reserved for people with extensive vitiligo, and is administered using whole‐body cabinets in hospital settings. Provision of home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB devices is rare outside a small number of specialist centres.,

The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial, was a three‐arm, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving children (age ≥ 5 years) and adults with vitiligo limited to approximately 10% or less of the body and at least one active patch of vitiligo. Recruitment took place in 16 UK hospitals. Participants were randomized to receive potent TCS plus dummy NB‐UVB, handheld NB‐UVB plus dummy TCS, or a combination of potent TCS plus NB‐UVB. TCS (or dummy) was applied once daily on alternate weeks. NB‐UVB (or dummy) was used on alternate days, with dose adjustment if erythema occurred. Treatments were used for 9 months, with 3‐monthly clinic assessments, followed by 12 months of post‐treatment follow‐up to assess duration of treatment response.

### Childhood vitiligo [^1147smpd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is a common acquired depigmenting skin disease characterized by a progressive loss of functional melanocytes. It may appear from the first years of life to late adulthood. Childhood vitiligo (CV), defined as vitiligo that begins before the age of 12 years, is common and may differ from post-CV in terms of epidemiology, clinical presentation, comorbidities, and treatment options. Taking into consideration the potential significant psychosocial impact of the disease on both children and their parents, all available therapeutic options must be offered to patients who desire treatment. According to the most recent guidelines, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy are the most commonly used treatment modalities for vitiligo in children. This review presents recent data regarding the whole spectrum of CV. Differences between CV and post-CV are also discussed.

### Prescribing and using vitiligo treatments: lessons from a nested process evaluation within the HI-light vitiligo randomized controlled trial [^114yU3tX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial has demonstrated that 62% of participants receiving combination treatment gained some degree of benefit, with 27% achieving treatment success and 35% achieving partial treatment success. Site investigators were encouraged and felt that the results supported further implementation; however, comments from some commissioners suggest that the results may be insufficient to support new treatment pathways, with some commissioners considering vitiligo to be a cosmetic problem, even though research has shown this not to be the case. Despite these differences of opinion, interviews with trial participants and site investigators support the potential for home‐based, handheld, NB‐UVB phototherapy, as has been demonstrated previously, and demonstrate the importance of offering new treatment options for people with vitiligo.

However, our evaluation also identified concerns about inappropriate use of NB‐UVB and about potentially harmful AEs. Previous studies of home‐based phototherapy have indicated that recipients need to be carefully selectedand willing to follow treatment guidelines'. eliable' people are those who understand the treatment risk and can follow instructions, although unconscious bias could lead to potentially suitable recipients being denied treatment; for instance, having other health issues, not understanding the treatment or being unwilling to be clinically monitored might suggest candidates who are 'unsuitable' for home‐based phototherapy. Our evaluation reinforces that candidate selection is complex, and that home‐based phototherapy will not be suitable for all.

Our evaluation also highlights that predicting behaviour is difficult, and that a programme of training, monitoring and ongoing support is essential in the delivery of combination treatment for vitiligo. The importance of supervisionand of regular follow‐up appointments to monitor treatment responsehave been recommended previously. Weekly phone contact and monthly outpatient visits have been proposed in a new NHS home‐based phototherapy service. Early and regular follow‐up contact may ensure appropriate use of TCS and NB‐UVB, limit side‐effects and help identify those struggling to manage the treatment regimen. Regular contact may also help HCPs to feel confident about the delivery of a home‐based treatment programme. A shared decision‐making tool has recently been developed, enabling people with vitiligo and HCPs to consider different treatment options, and to make joint decisions about which treatments might be most appropriate for a particular person, including whether they are likely to be able to use home‐based NB‐UVB safely and effectively.

It should be made available

Although identified as potentially complex there was consensus that this type of combination treatment should be more widely available to people with vitiligo; 75% of site investigators (in the survey) agreed or strongly agreed with this. In the discussion, they reiterated this position, emphasizing that this is a clinical population with few treatment options.
Site investigator focus group: Nurse 9: ' We have always said that it [combination treatment] is the best of a bad bunch of treatments, and it probably still is. There is no fantastic treatment out there for vitiligo, there doesn't seem to be, and the trial doesn't show that it's fantastic. It's shown that for patients it's worthwhile doing because the quality of life is impaired for a lot of patients. They are pinning hopes on it'. Site investigator focus group: Nurse 1: ' I was really encouraged by the HI‐Light: results, that there was a positive… '
Nurse 4: ' I think it's a disease with very limited treatments. And for that person living with that condition it has a massive impact… if combination treatment: was available that person would want to take it'.
Commissioners reinforced that people with vitiligo have few treatment options available to them and that treatment pathways for vitiligo are often lacking.

Trial participants described a desire for access to treatment; in particular, parents of child participants were often quite desperate for any treatment that might offer hope of remission.
Parent of child participant 9: '… we've been looking for a long time to find something like that because we've been at the NHS [National Health Service], and we were at a private doctor and nobody could not offer us anything except like some ointment, like cream and it was not really help… half of me was hoping that yes, something would work and it would help her, but if it didn't then we wasn't really going to lose anything'.

### Reliability and validity of the vitiligo signs of activity score (VSAS) [^112EjWCS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

A strength of this measurement instrument is that it can be used during a single consultation for all patients (of all ages and with its segmental subtype). However, for the interpretation of the calculated score in segmental vitiligo we need to keep in mind the generally more limited number of locations that are involved compared with nonsegmental vitiligo. Therefore, interpretation of the scores may better be restricted to the respective subtypes.

Limitations of this study are the limited number of cases, from a single tertiary centre, and the limited variations of skin phototype (mainly II–III) of the included patient population. This limits possible generalization of the results. Photographs were taken during routine practice, which might be considered an advantage, as the quality of the pictures represents a real‐life or routine situation. However, this also influenced the reduced availability of skin details (zoomed‐in pictures), which might have negatively influenced the reliability. Live scoring may further improve the reliability (increase the visibility of the signs), although the feasibility aspects (e.g. complexity and timing) within this environment still need to be evaluated.

More studies within the international network are definitely required, with more investigators and raters, and on a larger cohort of patients of different origins to evaluate the comprehensibility of the scoring system and to reach a final consensus. Moreover, future studies are needed to evaluate the responsiveness of the VSAS and VSAS subscores, the exact value of each clinical sign separately in the prediction of the global disease activity, and the relevance of VSAS from the patient perspective and/or its associations with patient‐reported outcomes. To improve future implementation and accessibility a software application is currently under construction.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the reliability, validity and completion time of the VSAS. This measurement instrument enables a standardized registration of clinical signs linked to disease activity in vitiligo. Moreover, it can be used for future trials that aim to establish the clinical significance of the specific visible clinical signs in vitiligo in a more controlled setting. However, complementary studies will be required within different international settings to get more insight into the value of this instrument. These should measure content and construct validity, including evaluation of the clinical relevance of the suggested grading and evaluation of the responsiveness, and translation of the score into categories (e.g. mild to very severe).

### Therapeutic options and hot topics in vitiligo with special focus on pediatrics' vitiligo: a comprehensive review study [^116GDxwh]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is a common skin disorder with an estimated worldwide prevalence to 2.28% which is connected with selective melanocytes loss which leads to depigmentation and chalky-white macules. Vitiligo may be dismissed as a cosmetic problem and may have psychologic impacts on patients. It is occurring in both children and adults and is considered as the most common depigmenting skin disorder in the world. There are still many unknown topics about this disease regarding to its treatment in pediatrics, curable drugs and manifestations. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the recent studies about its therapeutic strategies in pediatrics. Topical therapies should be considered as first line treatment in children, but phototherapy especially NBUVB may be used after topical treatment modalities failure or in extensive or rapidly progressive disease. Our suggestion for the treatment of this disease in children is to use combine treatment modalities with observing safety according to the patient's age.

### The burden of vitiligo: patient characteristics associated with quality of life [^1163vmdJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is commonly regarded as a harmless cosmetic skin problem in Western societies, and the importance of treating patients with vitiligo is often underestimated.

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical and sociodemographic variables that adversely affect the quality of life in adult patients with generalized vitiligo so that these variables can be considered in the treatment and care.

Methods

A total of 245 adult patients with generalized vitiligo completed two quality-of-life questionnaires (the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-form General Health Survey and the Skindex-29). Physicians assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these patients.

Results

Dark skin type, vitiligo located on the chest, and treatment in the past appeared to have an adverse impact on the psychosocial domains of quality of life. Moreover, itch was reported by 20% of the patients in this study.

Limitations

Psychiatric comorbidity was not evaluated in the analyses.

Conclusion

Generalized vitiligo is a serious skin disorder with an adverse impact on the emotional state, comparable with that of other major skin diseases.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of vitiligo with patient-reported quality of life and psychosocial health globally?

Findings

In this population-based qualitative study, 3541 patients with vitiligo across 17 countries reported substantial burden on quality of life, emotional well-being, daily life, and psychosocial health, with greater burden noted among patients with more than 5% affected body surface area, Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI (ie, darker skin), facial involvement, or hand involvement vs their counterparts.

Meaning

Findings suggest that improvement in the psychosocial health of patients should be prioritized in the management and treatment of vitiligo.

### Standardizing serial photography for assessing and monitoring vitiligo: a core set of international recommendations for essential clinical and technical specifications [^115izfvt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical photography is an important component of the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with vitiligo in clinical practice and research settings. Standardization of this photographic process is essential to achieve useful, high-quality, and comparable photographs over time.

Objective

The aim is to develop an international consensus for a core set of recommendations for standardized vitiligo clinical photography.

Methods

Based an international meeting of vitiligo experts, a standard operating procedure was developed for vitiligo photography in daily practice and research settings. This protocol was subsequently reviewed by 20 vitiligo experts until agreement was reached.

Results

The resulting protocol includes a set of 10 and 15 photographs for clinical practice and research purposes, respectively. The photographic series are based on anatomic units included in the Vitiligo Extent Score. Furthermore, graphic representations of standardized positioning and suggestions for guidelines to standardize the process (background color, lighting, position marking, scales, materials, instruments) for both color and ultraviolet photographs are described.

Conclusions

This consensus-based protocol for vitiligo photography will harmonize imaging for both clinical practice, translational research, and clinical trials. It can improve outcome assessment, foster multicenter collaboration, and promote better communication with patients regarding outcomes of treatment.

### Pigmentation disorders: diagnosis and management… [^111YEVrx]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility. Combination therapy usually produces the best results. Treatment of the underlying condition can help speed recovery, although weeks or months of therapy may be required, and resolution of hyperpigmentation is slow. Kligman's formula and Tri-luma are among the commercially available combination products. Azelaic acid, dexamethasone, salicylic acid, glycolic acid peels, retinoids, and laser treatments are sometimes helpful as monotherapy. Initial treatment with hydroquinone followed by serial chemical peels may be useful in chronic hyperpigmentation. Risk of ochronosis with typical hydroquinone formulations is rare. Topical retinoids are somewhat effective at reducing hyperpigmentation and disease severity, and are well tolerated. Treatment options may be affected by cost and insurance coverage. 2–5 In one limited trial involving patients at lowest risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, pretreatment with topical tretinoin showed no conclusive benefit. 6 No preventive measures have proven beneficial in any skin type. MELASMA Melasma is a progressive, macular, nonscaling hypermelanosis of sun-exposed skin, primarily on the face and dorsal forearms. An evidence-based review of melasma treatments, including topical depigmenting therapies, chemical peels, and light and laser therapies, demonstrated that combination triple therapy was most effective for treating moderate to severe melasma but had a high incidence of erythema and peeling. 7 Treatment must be continued indefinitely to maintain effect.

Chemical peels, light therapy, and laser therapy had mixed results. Adverse events included irritation of skin and postprocedure hyperpigmentation, which was more common in darker skin types. 7–10 Sunscreens are universally recommended to prevent worsening of melasma from further sun exposure. Pregnancy-induced melasma tends to fade postpartum, and treatment should be postponed to allow natural fading. 1 Treatment consists of topical and ablative therapies. Topical therapies for solar lentigines are the most consistently effective treatments. Hydroquinone is effective but can cause hypersensitivity and acneiform eruptions. Topical triple combination therapy may be used with or without cryotherapy. In one study, triple combination therapy used with cryotherapy enhanced resolution of solar lentigines and was well tolerated. 11 Retinoids such as tazarotene, tretinoin, and adapalene gel may reduce hyperpigmentation, but evidence is limited. 1 Adapalene 0. 1% gel has been approved for over-the-counter sale by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. 1 Cryotherapy is associated with pain and a risk of hyperpigmentation. Brief cryotherapy with repeated treatments is preferred over more intense one-time treatment. Multiple light and laser modalities are also effective, but they are more likely to cause postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and usually require dermatologic referral. 1 Figures 5a and 5b show solar lentigines before and after laser treatment. Nonsegmental vitiligo is typically bilateral or scattered symmetrically and evolves over time. It is considered generalized when it covers more than 10% of body surface area. Acral or acrofacial vitiligo typically involves the face and distal extremities.

### EuroGuiderm guideline on lichen sclerosus-introduction into lichen sclerosus [^112i7CJt]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for lichen sclerosus, more specifically with respect to indications for referral (general principles), EDF 2024 guidelines recommend to refer patients with lichen sclerosis to a specialist in cases of:

- no adequate improvement of signs and symptoms after adequate treatment

- complications requiring specialized approaches, such as functional impairment requiring surgical treatment or chronic pain syndromes requiring care by a pain specialist

- psychological support is needed

- sexological support is needed.

### Has the core outcome (domain) set for vitiligo been implemented? An updated systematic review on outcomes and outcome measures in vitiligo randomized clinical trials [^114Yb2us]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2015, a major achievement in vitiligo research was the development of an internationally agreed upon core outcome domain set for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Three outcomes were identified as being essential: repigmentation, side-effects/harms and maintenance of gained repigmentation. Four items were further recommended for inclusion. The following recommendations then followed: repigmentation should be assessed by measuring the percentage of repigmentation in quartiles (0–25%, 26–50%, 51–79%, 80–100%) and cosmetic acceptability of the results should be assessed using the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to assess uptake of the core outcome domain set for RCTs in vitiligo. Secondary objectives were to update the systematic review on outcomes reported in vitiligo RCTs, and to assess whether repigmentation and cosmetic acceptability of the results were measured using the above-mentioned recommended scales.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and Systematic Reviews) and ClinicalTrials.gov for vitiligo RCTs between November 2009 and March 2021. Screening and data extraction were independently performed on title and summary by two researchers. All outcomes and outcome measures reported in eligible RCTs were retrieved and collated.

Results

In total, 174 RCTs were identified: 62 were published between 2009 and 2015, and 112 were published between 2016 and 2021. Thirty-eight different outcomes were reported. Repigmentation was the primary outcome in 89% of trials (150 of 169). Forty-nine different tools were used to measure repigmentation. Side-effects and harms were reported in 78% of trials (136 of 174). Maintenance of gained repigmentation was reported in only 11% of trials (20 of 174) and duration of follow-up varied greatly from 1 to 14 months. Cosmetic acceptability of the results and cessation of disease activity were assessed in only 2% of trials (four of 174). Quality of life of patients with vitiligo was assessed in 13% of trials (22 of 174). Finally, only 11 of 112 RCTs (10%) published between 2016 and 2021 reported all three essential core outcome domains (repigmentation, side-effects and maintenance of gained repigmentation) and none of the trials reported both essential and recommended core outcome domains.

Conclusions

Efforts are still needed to close the gap between set recommendations and RCT outcome reporting.

### Beyond traditional treatment: the importance of psychosocial therapy in vitiligo [^111UPPNS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentation disorder of the skin. Patients with vitiligo often face a challenging disease course, having to cope with a condition that is known to be physically disfiguring, psychologically devastating, and socially stigmatizing. Although an extensive amount of research has been directed towards the dermatologic treatment of vitiligo, an overall lack of data exists investigating treatment of the psychological and emotional burden of patients with vitiligo. This paper reviews the literature for treatment options in patients with vitiligo that specifically target the psychosocial domain. Despite being limited in quantity, several studies have proven the benefits of adjuvant care in the form of group therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and self-help programs. Although preliminary evidence is promising, larger prospective studies are needed to further define the role of these psychosocial interventions before integrating them in a more official capacity into the standard of care for patients with vitiligo. Because of the considerable impact of vitiligo beyond its physical symptoms, dermatologists ought to consider the utility of adjuvant therapies to adequately address impairments in self-esteem, body image, and quality of life in patients with vitiligo.

### Clinical patterns of vitiligo in Japan: a descriptive study using the JMDC claims database [^115jNFcQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The management recommendations for vitiligo endorsed by the International Vitiligo Task Force in 2023 underscore the importance of shared decision‐making and delineate specific treatment goals and modalities that aim to halt disease progression, stabilize depigmented lesions, and promote repigmentation. Topical treatment, phototherapy, or systemic treatment is suggested for active vitiligo, while maintenance treatment is recommended for stable vitiligo to prevent flares. Surgical techniques are reserved for vitiligo stable for at least 12 months without treatment. The guidelines from the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA), last published in 2013, recommend topical corticosteroids (TCS) as first‐line therapy for mild or moderate vitiligo present on 10%–20% of the body surface area.

Due to outdated JDA guidelines and a lack of comprehensive, up‐to‐date, epidemiologic data on vitiligo in Japan, including sparse prevalence estimates and insufficient quantitative analyses of comorbidities and treatment patterns, there is a critical need for current evidence‐based insights to refine therapeutic strategies. To address these gaps and understand clinical needs, we conducted a real‐world study using data from a claims database to evaluate the prevalence of vitiligo, patient demographics, treatment patterns, and comorbidities in Japanese patients over a 13‐year period.

### Effective use of ustekinumab in a patient with concomitant psoriasis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata [^114EunEQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 39-year-old South Asian woman weighing 94 kg presented to our clinic in February 2016 with a several-year history of moderate generalized plaque psoriasis. In addition to psoriasis, she had a 1-year history of nonsegmental vitiligo of the face, scalp, and neck, and a 2-year history of patchy alopecia of the scalp. Her medical history was significant for asthma and penicillin allergy. She had no associated joint pain or personal history of other autoimmune disorder. Her family history was, however, significant for hypothyroidism. On physical examination, the patient had well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques covering approximately 10% of her body surface area. She was also noted to have 3 well-demarcated, depigmented patches ranging in size from 2 to 4 cm on the face to 5 cm on the back of her scalp. Finally, the patient had significantly decreased hair density with several round patches of nonscarring hair loss ranging from 2 to 4 cm in diameter. These findings were consistent with 3 separate diagnoses: moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, vitiligo, and AA.

In the past, the patient had been treated with etanercept for her psoriasis with no improvement. For her vitiligo, she had received intralesional triamcinolone injections with only minimal improvement. For her AA, she had received intramuscular vitamin B complex injections, also with a poor clinical response. After explaining the benefits and risk, the patient consented to treatment with ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous injection, initially administered at 0 and 4 weeks. Subsequent doses were administered every 8 weeks. Dose selection was based on our experience with AA in a published study where 90 mg of ustekinumab every 8 weeks proved effective. Because of a lack of established protocols in the published literature for either condition, we opted for what worked for AA. No other adjuvant medications were used with ustekinumab. The patient showed significant improvement in erythema and scaling of psoriatic lesions by week 8 and complete resolution with body surface area 0% by week 16. In addition to the excellent response seen with her psoriasis, the patient showed impressive improvement in vitiligo and AA lesions of the scalp (Fig 1). The vitiligo on her face and neck also improved. At week 20, hair density had visibly increased and repigmented macules were noted around the hair follicles in previously depigmented patches (Fig 2). The patient tolerated ustekinumab without adverse effects, and laboratory monitoring revealed no abnormalities.
