## Question

What could cause a priductive cough that continues despite a course of antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could cause a productive cough that continues despite a course of antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cough duration and classification because that frames the differential. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies in children versus adults. Next, I will examine why antibiotics might fail, including nonbacterial causes, resistant or atypical organisms, and structural disease. After that, I should outline a guideline-based diagnostic approach and when to escalate testing. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely causes and provide a concise, prioritized list with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame by duration, because productive coughs are categorized as acute (< 3 weeks), subacute (3–8 weeks), or chronic (> 8 weeks in adults; > 4 weeks in children), and this classification shapes the differential and the role of antibiotics. In adults, chronic cough is > 8 weeks; in children, chronic cough is > 4 weeks, and a wet/productive cough in children is particularly concerning for bacterial bronchitis and structural disease if it persists [^a5481c17] [^44a5dd95].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics helping a productive cough. I need to check the evidence base for when antibiotics are actually indicated. In adults with acute bronchitis, antibiotics offer minimal benefit and are not routinely recommended, whereas in children with chronic wet cough, high-quality evidence supports antibiotics for protracted bacterial bronchitis with an NNT around 3, so persistent wet cough after antibiotics in children is a red flag for an alternative diagnosis or incomplete treatment rather than typical viral bronchitis [^f0edbdc9] [^5292687d] [^9f585e76].

> Next, I should review the most likely causes in children when a wet cough persists despite antibiotics. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is common and typically responds to 2–4 weeks of amoxicillin–clavulanate; if cough persists after 4 weeks of appropriate therapy, the risk of bronchiectasis rises substantially, and guidelines recommend bronchoscopy with cultures and consideration of chest CT, with observational data showing an adjusted OR of about 20 for bronchiectasis when cough fails to resolve after 4 weeks of antibiotics [^26808c1f] [^583cfffa] [^dfe4d24d]. But wait, what if the child has other specific pointers? Digital clubbing, failure to thrive, or recurrent infections should prompt earlier evaluation for bronchiectasis, immunodeficiency, or aspiration, and chronic suppurative lung disease may precede radiographic bronchiectasis, so I need to ensure I do not delay necessary imaging and specialist input [^442772e7] [^47f3e54c].

> I will now examine adult etiologies, because the causes diverge from pediatrics. In adults with chronic productive cough, the most common causes are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic bronchitis/COPD; importantly, routine antibiotics are not indicated for stable chronic bronchitis or unexplained chronic cough, so persistent productive cough after antibiotics should steer me toward these noninfectious diagnoses or structural disease rather than repeating antibiotics [^6b3e1505] [^6991bdba] [^5a637b4c]. Let me consider exceptions: macrolides may be considered in select adults with refractory chronic bronchitis after other therapies fail, but this is conditional and stewardship-sensitive, not first-line for persistent cough after a standard antibiotic course [^1ea2e65e].

> But wait, what if the cough is due to a nonbacterial process that antibiotics cannot modify? I should double-check for asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, UACS, and reflux, which collectively account for most chronic cough in immunocompetent adults with a normal chest radiograph; in children, asthma and UACS are also common, and antibiotics will not help these entities unless there is a secondary bacterial infection, so I need to ensure I am not masking a noninfectious driver with repeated antibiotics [^6b3e1505] [^4ad63dd8]. I should also remember postinfectious cough, which can persist for weeks after a viral illness and is not an indication for antibiotics unless pertussis is suspected early in the course [^914b0444].

> I need to ensure I consider resistant or atypical organisms and biofilm-related disease. In children with persistent wet cough, biofilm-mediated bacterial infection in the lower airways may blunt antibiotic efficacy, and macrolides can have anti-inflammatory and anti-biofilm effects; however, guidelines still advise confirming the diagnosis and exhausting standard therapy before escalating to macrolides, and in adults with chronic productive cough, routine macrolides are not recommended for unexplained cough, reinforcing the need to identify the correct target before changing antibiotic class [^5a637b4c] [^b82dbe48]. Hold on, I should verify that sputum studies or bronchoscopy have been considered if cough persists beyond 4 weeks in children, because directed cultures can refine therapy and uncover resistant flora or atypicals [^583cfffa].

> Next, I should review structural and systemic contributors that antibiotics will not fix. Bronchiectasis presents with chronic productive cough and recurrent infections; in children, failure to respond to 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics substantially increases the likelihood of bronchiectasis, and in adults, BTS guidance supports investigating for bronchiectasis with HRCT when productive cough persists beyond 8 weeks or recurs, particularly with risk factors or purulent sputum [^dfe4d24d] [^442772e7]. Let me also consider immunodeficiency, aspiration, and connective tissue disease, which can underlie refractory productive cough and require targeted evaluation rather than repeated empiric antibiotics [^442772e7].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach and timing. In children with persistent wet cough beyond 4 weeks despite appropriate antibiotics, obtain chest radiography if not already done, consider spirometry if age-appropriate, and proceed to flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and, if indicated, chest CT to assess for bronchiectasis or other structural disease; in adults with chronic productive cough, start with chest radiography, spirometry with bronchodilator response, and assessment for the four most common causes, escalating to CT or specialty referral if cough persists or red flags emerge [^583cfffa] [^6b3e1505] [^da83142b]. Wait, let me verify that I am not missing red flags such as hemoptysis, weight loss, or clubbing, which should expedite imaging and specialist input rather than waiting on empiric therapy [^85e628c4].

> Let me synthesize the most likely causes by age. In children, persistent productive cough after appropriate antibiotics most strongly suggests incompletely treated protracted bacterial bronchitis, evolving bronchiectasis, or an alternative diagnosis such as asthma, UACS, immunodeficiency, or aspiration; the risk of bronchiectasis rises sharply after 4 weeks of failed therapy, so I should act before airway damage becomes irreversible [^26808c1f] [^dfe4d24d]. In adults, persistent productive cough after antibiotics points toward chronic bronchitis/COPD, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux, bronchiectasis, or medication-induced cough, with antibiotics rarely indicated unless there is evidence of bacterial infection or a stewardship-aligned indication for macrolides in select chronic bronchitis [^6b3e1505] [^6991bdba] [^1ea2e65e].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure I am not conflating acute bronchitis with chronic wet cough syndromes. Antibiotics often fail in persistent productive cough because the cause is nonbacterial, the diagnosis is incorrect, the treatment duration or agent is inadequate for the true pathogen, or there is underlying structural disease such as bronchiectasis; a guideline-directed, time-limited approach with reassessment at 2–4 weeks and escalation to targeted testing after 4 weeks in children or 8 weeks in adults is the safest, most evidence-based way to uncover the real etiology and avoid harm from repeated, ineffective antibiotics [^26808c1f] [^583cfffa] [^6b3e1505].

A productive cough persisting after antibiotics most often reflects **non-bacterial causes** (UACS, asthma, GERD, NAEB) [^6b3e1505], **antibiotic-resistant or atypical pathogens** (e.g. pertussis, MAC, MRSA) [^notfound], or **structural lung disease** (bronchiectasis, COPD, CF) [^442772e7]. Other contributors include post-infectious cough [^914b0444], medication-induced cough (ACE inhibitors) [^fef91b31], and immunodeficiency [^fc518f55]. Persistent cough warrants **targeted evaluation** — chest imaging, spirometry, sputum studies, and specialist referral — to identify the cause and guide therapy [^da83142b] [^6b3e1505].

---

## Non-bacterial etiologies

Several **non-bacterial conditions** can cause productive cough that does not respond to antibiotics:

- **Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)**: Chronic rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis can cause postnasal drip and productive cough; antibiotics are ineffective unless bacterial infection is present [^6b3e1505].

- **Asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis**: Cough-variant asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis can present with productive cough; inhaled corticosteroids are effective, not antibiotics [^d54e52fb].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Reflux-related cough is common and does not respond to antibiotics; acid suppression and lifestyle changes are indicated [^fef91b31].

- **Post-infectious cough**: Viral or bacterial infections can cause persistent cough due to airway hyperresponsiveness; antibiotics are not helpful unless bacterial infection is ongoing [^914b0444].

---

## Antibiotic-resistant or atypical pathogens

Some pathogens are **intrinsically resistant** or require specific antibiotics:

- **Pertussis**: Macrolides are effective only early; late treatment does not shorten cough duration [^a064477c].

- **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)**: Causes chronic productive cough; macrolide-based regimens are required [^notfound].

- **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**: Requires specific antibiotics; standard regimens may fail [^notfound].

---

## Structural lung diseases

Structural lung diseases can cause **chronic productive cough** that persists despite antibiotics:

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic productive cough with recurrent infections; antibiotics reduce exacerbations but do not cure the disease [^d7d414b2].

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Chronic bronchitis causes productive cough; antibiotics are reserved for exacerbations, not stable disease [^6991bdba].

- **Cystic fibrosis**: Chronic productive cough due to thick secretions and recurrent infections; requires specialized management [^dfd7b3f0].

---

## Inadequate antibiotic therapy

In some cases, **antibiotic failure** reflects suboptimal therapy:

- **Incorrect antibiotic selection**: Not targeting the causative organism (e.g. viral infection, atypical pathogens) [^a064477c].

- **Insufficient duration**: Too short a course, especially for chronic infections like bronchiectasis or MAC [^c94ceebb].

- **Poor adherence**: Nonadherence reduces efficacy and promotes resistance [^notfound].

---

## Immunocompromised states

Immunocompromised patients may have **persistent productive cough** due to opportunistic infections (e.g. fungal, mycobacterial) or non-infectious causes; antibiotics alone are often insufficient [^e5303a70].

---

## Medication-induced cough

Certain medications can cause **chronic cough** that persists despite antibiotics, notably ACE inhibitors; switching to ARBs usually resolves the cough [^fef91b31].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

When a productive cough persists after antibiotics, a **systematic evaluation** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history and physical exam | Identify non-bacterial causes, medication use, structural disease [^6b3e1505] |
| 2 | Chest radiograph | Rule out pneumonia, bronchiectasis, malignancy [^6b3e1505] |
| 3 | Spirometry | Assess for asthma, COPD, eosinophilic bronchitis [^6b3e1505] |
| 4 | Sputum culture | Identify resistant or atypical pathogens [^notfound] |
| 5 | High-resolution chest CT | Evaluate for bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease [^d7d414b2] |
| 6 | Specialist referral | Pulmonology, ENT, or allergy evaluation [^46440c20] |

---

A productive cough that persists after antibiotics is most often due to **non-bacterial causes**, resistant or atypical pathogens, structural lung disease, inadequate therapy, immunocompromise, or medication effects. A **structured evaluation** — imaging, pulmonary function testing, sputum studies, and specialist input — is essential to identify the cause and direct effective therapy [^6b3e1505].

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^daa724da]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult lung cancer with persistent cough: In adult patients with cough associated with lung cancer that persists despite cancer treatment, we suggest, as a first step, that a comprehensive assessment according to a published, evidence-based management guideline be undertaken to identify any co-existing causes linked with cough and initiate treatment accordingly (Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement). The narrative emphasizes initiating management with a comprehensive assessment targeting treatable causes, notes that physicians should also differentiate between productive and nonproductive cough because the aim of treatment differs, and gives examples that causes may be treated with oncological treatment of cancer, pleural drainage, antibiotics, or steroid therapy when appropriate.

### Causes of chronic productive cough: an approach to management [^fc518f55]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A chronic 'productive' or 'wet' cough is a common presenting complaint for patients attending the adult respiratory clinic. Most reviews and guidelines suggest that the causes of a productive cough are the same as those of a non-productive cough and as such the same diagnostic pathway should be followed. We suggest a different diagnostic approach for patients with a productive cough, focussing on the conditions that are the most likely causes of this problem. This review is intended to briefly summarise the epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of a number of conditions which are often associated with chronic productive cough to aid decision making when encountering a patient with this often distressing symptom. The conditions discussed include bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis and immunodeficiency. We also propose an adult version of the paediatric diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in patients with idiopathic chronic productive cough who appear to respond well to low dose macrolide therapy.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^f3b73919]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

For clarity, PBB is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^5292687d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Reversal of bronchiectasis in children: early intervention may stop the vicious circle! [^e4ae9e85]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, there are important clinical and scientific implications from this large study. It is certainly biologically implausible that airways can instantaneously pass from normal caliber to fixed dilatation without passing through a mild stage that is potentially reversible; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Indeed, the vast majority of 150 adults with CT-documented bronchiectasis had the onset of chronic wet, productive cough in childhood, many with an underlying diagnosis of an inherited condition, a litany of diagnostic failure in childhood. Normal children have an intermittent wet cough with viral colds that may last up to 3 weeks, but an absolute red flag is the child who has a continuous wet-sounding, "smoker's" cough for more than 4 weeks. It is salutary to consider how many cases of adult bronchiectasis are a result of failure to make an early diagnosis (including attempts to define the underlying cause) and initiate energetic treatment with the aim of reversing airway dilatation. Indeed, treatment should start well before the airways dilate; pediatricians recognize persistent bacterial bronchitis as a condition, characterized by chronic lower airway infection and inflammation, that often responds to a single course of antibiotics but that may recur or persist. The same aggressive use of antibiotics and airway clearance should be initiated in the treatment of persistent bacterial bronchitis without waiting for the airways to dilate.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^099f05fb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^541d2751]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to diagnosis of unexplained chronic cough, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to define unexplained chronic cough as a cough that persists > 8 weeks, remains unexplained after investigation, and persists despite supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines in adult patients with chronic cough.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f68f9e53]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic wet cough without specific pointers — among children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any other specific cough pointers, when the wet cough persists after 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we recommend treatment with an additional 2 weeks of the appropriate antibiotic(s) (Grade 1C), and when it persists after 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we suggest that further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and sensitivities with or without chest CT) be undertaken (Grade 2B).

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guideline for the management of CRMS / CFSPID [^1a824daa]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious Disease Interventions

The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID, selectively offering inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of Pa based on a positive respiratory culture (Grade C).
The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID and an unexplained prolonged cough (> 2 weeks), selectively offering the use of oral antibiotics (Grade C).

A higher prevalence of Pa is reported in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID compared with those collected from children without CF, and treatment to eradicate incident Pa infection is recommended for pwCF. However, the clinical impact of Pa in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID is unclear. Pa may clear spontaneously, (ie, independent of whether treatment is provided), calling into question the value of Pa eradication therapy. The committee recommends selectively offering this treatment after a SDM process incorporating the potential benefits, risks, and treatment burden of inhaled antibiotic therapy in people with CRMS/CFSPID with positive respiratory culture for Pa. If the decision is to treat, then follow-up cultures are warranted to ensure Pa clearance.

Precedent is established regarding use of oral antibiotics for prolonged cough for individuals with respiratory conditions other than CF, including tracheobronchomalacia, protracted bacterial bronchitis, non-CF bronchiectasis and neuromuscular disease. – The committee discussed this consideration while weighing the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy. The use of any antibiotic for eradication or treatment may depend on clinical status of the individual, and the risks and benefits of treatment burden should be assessed for each family. For people with CRMS/CFSPID with a cough lasting > 2 weeks, other etiologies of persistent cough, such as asthma, should be considered.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^b24d77fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^32c17a5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22. Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children [^bbc85982]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory condition with high prevalence worldwide. This clinically diagnosed syndrome is manifested by tachypnoea (rapid breathing), with crackles or wheeze in young children. In the acute phase of bronchiolitis (≤ 14 days), antibiotics are not routinely prescribed unless the illness is severe or a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Although bronchiolitis is usually self-limiting, some young children continue to have protracted symptoms (e.g. cough and wheezing) beyond the acute phase and often re-present to secondary care.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) for reducing or treating persistent respiratory symptoms following acute bronchiolitis within six months of acute illness.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the World Health Organization (WHO) trial portal, the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov, up to 26 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) given in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis (> 14 days) for children younger than two years with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies against predefined criteria, and selected, extracted, and assessed data for inclusion. We contacted trial authors for further information.

Main Results

In this review update, we added one study with 219 children. A total of two RCTs with 249 children (n = 240 completed) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Both studies contributed to our primary and secondary outcomes, but we assessed the quality of evidence for our three primary outcomes as low, owing to the small numbers of studies and participants; and high attrition in one of the studies. Data show no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.28; fixed-effect model); and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21; random-effects model). We were unable to analyse exacerbation rate because studies used different methods to report this information. Data showed no significant differences between treatment groups for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.95; random-effects model). One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours (thus with limited applicability for this review). Another study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase. Future RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics for reducing persistent respiratory symptoms. This is particularly important in populations with high acute and post-acute bronchiolitis morbidity (e.g. indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA).

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management… [^fef91b31]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

COPD commonly causes chronic cough, but most patients presenting with chronic cough do not have undiagnosed COPD. Signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma also occur in persons with COPD. Spirometry is diagnostic, and purulent sputum production may also be present. Treatment includes an inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled anticholinergic, inhaled corticosteroid, and a one- to two-week course of oral corticosteroids.
18. 21 Studies have shown an association between GERD and chronic cough, but the pathophysiology is complex and treatment is controversial. 2, 22, 23 Associated manifestations such as heartburn, regurgitation, sour taste, hoarseness, and globus sensation are clinical clues. Although several uncontrolled studies have shown improvement of chronic cough with antacid treatment, more recent randomized controlled trials have shown no differences between proton pump inhibitors and placebo.

24–29 Although there is poor evidence that proton pump inhibitors are universally beneficial for GERD-induced chronic cough, 30 consensus guidelines recommend empiric therapy for at least eight weeks in conjunction with lifestyle changes such as dietary changes and weight loss. 4, 31 The addition of a histamine H 2 receptor antagonist and/or baclofen may be helpful. 32, 33. ACE Inhibitor–Related Cough ACE inhibitor–related cough has been reported in 5% to 35% of patients and is more common in women. 35 It may start within hours to months of the first dose. When the medication is discontinued, resolution of the cough should occur within one week to three months; this is the only way to determine if the ACE inhibitor is causing the cough. Angiotensin receptor blockers are a good alternative to ACE inhibitors. However, if the patient has a strong indication, restarting the ACE inhibitor may be attempted; in some patients, the cough will not recur.

35 When considering ACE inhibitors as the cause of chronic cough, other common causes should also be investigated. The most common causes of chronic cough in children six to 14 years of age are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and UACS. 4, 6, 42 Protracted bacterial bronchitis is characterized by isolated chronic cough, wet/moist cough, resolution of cough with antibiotic treatment, and absence of findings suggestive of an alternative cause. Treatment consists of a two-week course of an appropriate antibiotic, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate. 43, 44.

### Chronic cough in children [^c2c1cd49]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic cough has been variably defined as a cough lasting longer than 3, 4 or 8 weeks. Many post viral or pertussis like illnesses are associated with prolonged coughing that resolves over time. Management involves first trying to make a diagnosis and identify the presence of any underlying condition. Targeted treatments can then be employed. Trials of treatments are often used to make a diagnosis. Because natural resolution of cough is so common any trial of treatment to confirm a diagnosis should be time limited and the treatment only restarted if the coughing returns. Only a small proportion of children with an isolated non-specific dry cough have asthma and care is needed not to over diagnose asthma. Children with chronic wet cough may have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) that responds to a full course of antibiotics. Children with PBB failing to respond to treatment or with specific pointers should be investigated for specific causes of suppurative lung disease.

Chronic cough is a common complaint in the ambulatory setting and can result in significant compromise in quality of life and, uncommonly, is a presenting symptom of serious or life-threatening disease. Although there are many potential causes, an organized approach to diagnosis that may include therapeutic trials of select medications can establish the diagnosis in over 90% of presenting patients. Management hinges on accurate etiologic diagnosis. Consultation with a pulmonologist, otolaryngologist, or allergist is indicated in selected cases where diagnosis is unclear or specific therapy is mandated.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^fa2edb21]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Recurrent, protracted and persistent lower respiratory tract infection: a neglected clinical entity [^4fc8e5e9]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening disease affecting children worldwide. Recurrent pneumonia episodes can lead to the development of chronic respiratory morbidity. Chronic wet cough, a common pediatric complaint, is defined as a wet cough indicating excessive airway mucus that lasts for a minimum of 4 weeks. Most children with a chronic wet cough do not suffer from underlying debilitating pulmonary disorders. Rather, chronic wet cough is generally associated with neutrophilic airway inflammation and bacterial infections of the conducting airways. Failure to characterize endobronchial infections has led to under-recognition of chronic wet cough as an important clinical entity in children. Under-recognition and under-treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), a diagnosis made by the presence of isolated cough > 4 weeks that resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment, may lead to the development of chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis. The burden of bronchiectasis is highest in developing countries and in specifically vulnerable populations in developed countries, in particular indigenous children living in remote communities. The incidence, hospitalization rates and risk of long term sequelae of childhood pneumonia in indigenous children are higher than in non-indigenous children residing in the same area. The overlapping clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the presence of a chronic wet cough, impaired mucociliary clearance of the conducting airways, the presence of endobronchial bacterial infection (mainly non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and neutrophilic airway inflammation. The principles of managing PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the same. More research and public health interventions are required to improve the awareness, diagnosis and management of these causes of chronic wet cough in children.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^914b0444]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting > 8 weeks, is a common medical condition with a global prevalence of approximately 10% and a higher prevalence in Oceania, Europe, and the United States. 1, 2 The burden of CC can be severe, as patients with CC experience substantial physical effects (e.g. stress urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, and chest pain), psychological consequences (e.g. frustration, anxiety, and depression), and social impairments (e.g. social distress/isolation and inability to carry out daily activities), leading to a reduced quality of life. 3, 4, 5 Moreover, the burden of CC is often long‐lasting, as some patients with CC experience symptoms that persist for several years despite numerous doctor visits, empirical treatment trials, and frequent medical testing. 4, 5, 6

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^442772e7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

In whom should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be suspected?

Recommendations

Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with persistent production of mucopurulent or purulent sputum particularly with relevant associated risk factors (D).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if they have symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections (C).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations (two or more annually) and a previous positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa while stable (B).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic productive cough (C).

Good practice points

In at-risk groups, if bronchiectasis is suspected, bronchiectasis needs confirmation.
In patients with COPD, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate especially in the presence of chronic productive cough with positive sputum cultures for potential pathogenic micro-organism (PPM) while stable or two or more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.
In patients with asthma, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with severe or poorly controlled disease.
In patients with a history of HIV-1 infection, solid organ and bone marrow transplant, and history of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma and vasculitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with other connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate if they have symptoms such as chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
Investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate in otherwise healthy individuals with a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks, especially with sputum production or a history of an appropriate trigger (see BTS Recommendations for the management of cough in adults).

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^d01cb200]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for Bronchiectasis in adults were published in January 2019, and comprise recommendations for treatment from primary to tertiary care. Here, we outline the practical implications of these guidelines for primary care practitioners. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be considered when a patient presents with a recurrent or persistent (> 8 weeks) productive cough. A definitive diagnosis is made by using thin-section chest computed tomography (CT). Once diagnosed, patients should be initially assessed by a specialist respiratory team and a shared management plan formulated with the patient, the specialist and primary care teams. The cornerstone of primary care management is physiotherapy to improve airway sputum clearance and maximise exercise capacity, with prompt treatment of acute exacerbations with antibiotics.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a064477c]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

This overview will demonstrate that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem. Improvement in the quality of care of those with cough has been the focus of study for a variety of disciplines in medicine. The purpose of the Cough Guideline and Expert Panel is to synthesize current knowledge in a form that will aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and also identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^26c426be]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made.

Results

Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some, but not all, aspects of the management of chronic wet cough in specialist settings. However, further studies (particularly in primary health) are required.

### Children with chronic wet or productive cough – treatment and investigations: a systematic review [^9f585e76]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews were conducted to examine two related key questions (KQs) in children with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough not related to bronchiectasis: KQ1-How effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? KQ2-When should they be referred for further investigations?

Methods

The systematic reviews were undertaken based on the protocol established by selected members of the CHEST expert cough panel. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. The study included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort (prospective and retrospective) studies, and cross-sectional studies published in English.

Results

Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowcharts, and the summaries were tabulated. Fifteen studies were included in KQ1 (three systematic reviews, three RCTs, five prospective studies, and four retrospective studies) and 17 in KQ2 (one RCT, 11 prospective studies, and five retrospective studies). Combining data from the RCTs (KQ1), the number needed to treat for benefit was 3 (95% CI, 2.0–4.3) in achieving cough resolution. In general, findings from prospective and retrospective studies were consistent, but there were minor variations.

Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough, the use of appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution. There is also high-quality evidence that when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present in children with wet cough, further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be conducted. When the wet cough does not improve by 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that children should be referred to a major center for further investigations to determine whether an underlying lung or other disease is present.

### Antibiotic prescription strategies and adverse outcome for uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections: prospective cough complication cohort (3C) study [^82f10138]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Prescribing immediate antibiotics may not reduce subsequent hospital admission or death for young people and adults with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection, and such events are uncommon. If clinicians are considering antibiotics, a delayed prescription may be preferable since it is associated with reduced number of reconsultations with worsening illness.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^817f120e]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^d7d414b2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be suspected when a patient presents with a persistent or recurrent productive cough. Definitive diagnosis is made by thin-section CT scan of the chest. Assessment of bronchiectasis should be carried out in secondary/tertiary care, where a shared management plan should be formulated with the patient and the community/primary care team.

Many patients can be routinely managed in primary care, where the cornerstone of management is physiotherapy to improve sputum clearance and maximise exercise capacity and prompt treatment of exacerbations with antibiotics.

The British Thoracic Society Bronchiectasis Guidelines provide advice for diagnosis and management of primary care in the United Kingdom. Although some of the advice, such as the type of antibiotics to be used, is specific to the United Kingdom, many of the recommendations are in line with those of the European Respiratory Society Guidelines 2017, and provide a sound basis for primary care management of this increasingly prevalent disease throughout the world.

### Does failed chronic wet cough response to antibiotics predict bronchiectasis? [^dfe4d24d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether a child with chronic wet cough and poor response to at least 4weeks of oral antibiotics is more likely to have bronchiectasis.

Methods

All chest multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) scans at a single paediatric tertiary hospital from April 2010 to August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively so as to identify those ordered by respiratory physicians for assessment of children with a chronic wet cough. Information regarding age, sex, ethnicity, indication for imaging and the response to at least 4weeks of antibiotics before having the scan were recorded from their charts. The data were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression.

Results

Of the 144 (87 males) eligible children, 106 (65 males, 30 Indigenous) aged 10-199months had MDCT scan evidence of bronchiectasis. Antibiotic data were available for 129 children. Among the 105 children with persistent cough despite at least 4weeks of antibiotics, 88 (83.8%) had bronchiectasis, while of the 24 children whose cough resolved after antibiotics, only six (25.0%) received this diagnosis (adjusted OR 20.9; 95% CI 5.36 to 81.8). Being Indigenous was also independently associated with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis (adjusted OR 5.86; 95% CI 1.20 to 28.5).

Conclusions

Further investigations including a MDCT scan should be considered in a child with a chronic wet cough that persists following 4weeks of oral antibiotics. However, while reducing the likelihood of underlying bronchiectasis, responding well to a single prolonged course of antibiotics does not exclude this diagnosis completely.

### Methodology and grading of the evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d8ca5b3d]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assemble a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of cough with the intention of developing clinically relevant practice guidelines for pulmonary and primary care physicians, including recommendations covering many etiologies of cough, adult and pediatric evaluation and treatment, and empiric yet integrative algorithms for the management of the patient with cough.

Methods

The Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research was selected to review and summarize the current evidence in this area. The expert panel established clinical recommendations and algorithms founded on the synthesis of this evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the approach used to develop the guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence, assessing the strength of evidence pertinent to individual guidelines, and grading the guideline recommendations.

### Antibiotic prescription strategies and adverse outcome for uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections: prospective cough complication cohort (3C) study [^58c47218]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

As far as we are aware this is one of the very few prospective clinical cohorts with sufficient power to address the impact of antibiotic prescribing strategies on subsequent major adverse outcomes. Even in a cohort of 30 000 participants, it was not possible to show that either immediate or delayed antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction in subsequent hospital admission or death. Non-resolving symptoms or progression of the illness with new symptoms was common, and a delayed prescription but not immediate antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction in reconsultations with such symptoms.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9f340980]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Subacute cough in adults — The updated management algorithm includes the suggestions that history should be sought for hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptoms and, if present, should be immediately addressed and evaluated; a validated cough severity or quality of life tool be routinely used to assess the outcome of therapy; environmental and occupational exposures be considered and addressed if present; and patients be routinely followed up in the clinic or by telephone within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial evaluation. If cough persists, a follow-up appointment should be arranged.

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management [^6b3e1505]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although chronic cough in adults (cough lasting longer than eight weeks) can be caused by many etiologies, four conditions account for most cases: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Patients should be evaluated clinically (with spirometry, if indicated), and empiric treatment should be initiated. Other potential causes include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, environmental triggers, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Chest radiography can rule out concerning infectious, inflammatory, and malignant thoracic conditions. Patients with refractory chronic cough may warrant referral to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist in addition to a trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, and/or speech therapy. In children, cough is considered chronic if present for more than four weeks. In children six to 14 years of age, it is most commonly caused by asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and upper airway cough syndrome. Evaluation should focus initially on these etiologies, with targeted treatment and monitoring for resolution.

### Childhood' bronchitis' and respiratory outcomes in middle-age: a prospective cohort study from age 7 to 53 years [^b0e43127]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

'Bronchitis' implies airway inflammation. However, historically, the term bronchitis in childhood has been applied broadly to bouts of coughing without implying a specific cause or diagnosis, for example, asthma or bacterial bronchitis. Clinicians have previously believed that 'wheezy bronchitis', on the other hand, signifies asthma. However, the terminology and understanding of the causes of paediatric cough has since evolved significantly and the paradigm has changed. It is now recognised and accepted that 'chronic cough' in children, that is, cough lasting > 4 weeks, can be caused by a range of pathologies including protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), bronchiectasis, asthma and tracheo/bronchomalacia. Furthermore, wheeze and cough can be common to all of these conditions.

PBB, also known as chronic bacterial bronchitis, is recognised as a discrete diagnostic entity by Respiratory Societies across Europe, the USAand Australia/New Zealand. PBB is defined as presence of a chronic 'wet' cough that lasts 1 month or more and resolves with 2–4 weeks of appropriate antibiotic therapy, in the absence of indicators to suggest another cause for the cough. Prospective paediatric cohort studies have described a link between PBB and both bronchiectasis and asthma, with 27% of children with PBB having an asthma phenotype 5 years laterand 8%–10% having bronchiectasis within 2–5 years. Whether chronic bronchitis (CB) in childhood is associated with poor lung health in adulthood is unknown and represents an important research priority, with potential to improve outcomes through earlier recognition and management.

Longitudinal cohort studies from early life to adulthood have provided important insights into lung disease developmentand are closing the gap in understanding between paediatric and adult respiratory medicine. While several studies have supported the role of early life exposures in adult lung function deficits and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the early origins of adult chronic productive cough (or CB) remain poorly understood and sparsely studied.

Using population-based data from our Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) longitudinal cohort, we aimed to investigate trends and associations between bronchitis severity at age 7 in childhood and respiratory health outcomes of asthma, CB, pneumonia and lung function in middle-age at age 53.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^d31ad918]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation — when to suspect bronchiectasis

A 66-year-old lady presents with a chest infection associated with cough productive of green sputum and increasing shortness of breath. She had never smoked and has no relevant past medical history. Chest x-ray shows no abnormality. She is treated with antibiotic therapy by her primary care physician and improves. She attends again a few months later with worsening productive cough. Her primary care physician notes that she has had several courses of antibiotics for chest infections over the previous 3 winters and has reported a chronic productive cough on a daily basis for the past 3 years.

In new patients or those that do not have an established diagnosis, one of the most common core symptoms is a persistent cough (> 90% of patients), often producing large quantities of mucoid (white or clear) or purulent (dark yellow, green or brown) sputum(Table 2). Adults may have a history of symptoms over many years. Recurrent respiratory tract infections also raise the possibility of bronchiectasis, and patients may take a long time to recover from chest infections or require multiple courses of antibiotics before symptoms fully resolve. Dyspnoea is present in a high proportion of cases, with frequent haemoptysis in severe disease. These symptoms can be variable across patients, with some having symptoms daily and others only having symptoms during exacerbations. The longstanding textbook teaching of bronchiectasis patients with widespread crackles, digital clubbing and cachexia is now rarely seen.

### Antibiotic prescription strategies and adverse outcome for uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections: prospective cough complication cohort (3C) study [^816fdec1]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

A structured proforma was used to document clinical presenting features and management at the index consultation. Review of medical records documented reconsultations with new or worsening illness, hospital admission, or death during the next 30 days.

The study took place in UK primary care. Participants were eligible if they were aged 16 years or more and had acute lower respiratory tract infection — defined as acute cough (new or worsening cough for three weeks or less) presenting as the main symptom and judged to be infective in origin by the doctor, consistent with the Cochrane reviewand previous studies. We excluded patients who had other causes of acute cough (eg, heart failure, acid reflux, fibrosing alveolitis), were unable to consent (eg, severe mental illness), were immunocompromised, had previously presented with the same episode of illness, or had been included previously.

Data collection

Clinical record form

Doctors completed a clinical record form in the consultation, documenting age, smoking history, duration of symptoms, nature of symptoms (dry or productive cough, shortness of breath, coryza, fever, chills or shivering, chest pain, headache, muscle aches, sleep disturbance, confusion, diarrhoea, sputum colour), examination results (respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, presence of wheeze, crepitations, or bronchial breathing), a rating of overall severity (visual analogue scale ranging from "well" to "very unwell"), and if antibiotics were prescribed.

Outcomes (review of clinical records at 30 days)

The main outcome measures were reconsultation in primary care or visit to an emergency department with progression of illness (ie, with non-resolution of symptoms or new symptoms or signs)in the 30 days after the index consultation, hospital admission, or death.

Other data

Comorbidities noted in the medical records were also documented. Lung comorbidity included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or history of other important lung disease requiring hospital investigation, and use of steroids or bronchodilators. Vaccination status (pneumococcal vaccination) was recorded.

Practice staff assessed the clinical records using a structured proforma. Most baseline data were captured by electronic data capture live during consultations, and the small proportion completed on paper was double entered. Data recorded on paper at follow-up review were double entered. The patient's postcode was used to assign deprivation, based on the national deprivation index.

### Impact of refractory and unexplained chronic cough on disease burden: a qualitative study [^6ca82876]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is one of the most common symptoms experienced worldwide by patients seeking medical care. It is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, and is responsible for up to 12% of overall consultations at outpatient clinics and hospitals in Japan. Cough is categorized based on duration: acute cough, subacute cough, and chronic cough, with each defined as lasting up to 3 weeks, 3 to 8 weeks, and lasting for more than 8 weeks, respectively. The global prevalence of chronic cough varies from 2 to 18% in different geographical regions, as identified in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 90 studies. According to a recent online survey in Japan, the nationwide prevalence of chronic cough was 2.9% at the time of the survey, while 4.3% of the participants who experienced cough in the past 12 months had cough lasting more than 8 weeks. In another internet-based survey of 1000 cough patients in Japan, chronic cough was reported in 23.2% of subjects who had cough at the time of the survey.

As a wide range of diseases may be associated with chronic cough in adults, the 2019 Japanese guidelines recommend first exploring whether there is a single or major cause of cough, including respiratory infections, lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When the cause of chronic cough cannot be easily identified by medical interviews, physical findings, and chest X-rays, cough-variant asthma, atopic cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sinobronchial syndrome (SBS), and postinfectious cough are thought to be frequent underlying diseases. A small proportion of chronic cough patients have persistent cough despite thorough investigations and treatment. In patients with refractory chronic cough, cough symptoms persist even after appropriate treatment of underlying medical condition in accordance with guidelines. A patient may also be considered as having unexplained chronic cough, where no diagnosable cause for cough can be identified despite extensive evaluation of all possible causes.

### Azithromycin and cough-specific health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic cough: a randomised controlled trial [^9689be2d]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study showed that prophylactic azithromycin of 250 mg, three times a week for three months, provided significant and clinically relevant improvements in cough specific health status in patients with COPD and chronic productive cough. This was supported by improvements in disease specific and generic health status parameters, and although not powered to assess a reduction in exacerbation rate, the tendency was nevertheless clear. The effects were largely limited to those with a high burden of cough specific complaints at baseline. Interesting next steps would be studies limited to patients with a high LCQ, perhaps assessing also the level of airway inflammation. We believe it is an interesting thought to further elaborate on duration of macrolides treatment and whether it should be continuous or recurrent.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^f0edbdc9]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antibiotics associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute bronchitis?

Bottom Line

Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in duration of cough, in days feeling ill, and in days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those receiving placebo in overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^1e275164]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking).

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^cb0f1dc8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### Future directions in the clinical management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e5303a70]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To impart a call for further research into the identified domains of particular interest in the etiology, management, and treatment of cough.

Design/Methodology

A literature review was performed using the search term "cough" in PubMed between 1983 and 2004. The final draft of this guideline was reviewed, in addition to recent studies on cough, and suggestions provided by the authors were collated into a definitive inventory of specific areas in which the lack of quality evidence encumbered the development of clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations.

Results/Conclusions

Although our understanding of the causes and optimal management of chronic cough have significantly increased over the past 25 years, further research remains to be done on this common symptom. This is reflected by the generally low level of evidence for many of the recommendations in these guidelines. Research is particularly needed on the optimal treatment of postinfectious cough, how to distinguish acute bronchitis from other conditions, how to reliably diagnose and treat cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, clearly identifying a role for nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities in diseases associated with an increased production of bronchial secretions, determining how often cough in patients with interstitial lung disease is due to conditions other than these, establishing the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in the immunocompromised hosts, and better characterizing psychogenic cough. Further studies are also needed on methods for the assessment of cough, in particular, noninvasive measures of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapy. It should be determined how often unexplained cough (previously referred to as idiopathic cough) is due to the use of non-evidence-based guidelines or to environmental causes, and assessed whether an empiric, integrative approach of diagnosing chronic cough leads to better outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, than routine testing. While much work has been done on chronic cough, we need studies on the spectrum and frequency of acute and subacute coughs.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^44a5dd95]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and initial threshold: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Because cough can spontaneously resolve within 4 weeks, the guideline does not advocate using medications or investigating all children at the 4-week timepoint other than with simple tests such as spirometry and a chest radiograph. Supporting the need for careful assessment, a serious potentially progressive underlying respiratory illness was documented in 18% of 346 children in a multicenter study using a cough algorithm, and new serious chronic lung disease was found in up to 30.8% of children with acute cough persisting > 4 weeks at a specialist hospital.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^5e335e25]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic wet/productive cough (≤ 14 years) diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis — For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing) and whose cough resolves within 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics targeted to local antibiotic sensitivities, we recommend that the diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) be made (Grade 1C).

### Cough: a worldwide problem [^4ad63dd8]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.

### An empiric integrative approach to the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^38eeaf53]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Review the literature to provide a comprehensive approach, including algorithms for the clinician to follow in evaluating and treating the patient with acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (through May 2004) for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "treatment of cough", and "empiric treatment of cough". We selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials. We also obtained any references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic.

Results

The relative frequency of the disorders (alone and in combination) that can cause cough as well as the sensitivity and specificity of many but not all diagnostic tests in predicting the cause of cough are known. An effective approach to successfully manage chronic cough is to sequentially evaluate and treat for the common causes of cough using a combination of selected diagnostic tests and empiric therapy. Sequential and additive therapy is often crucial because more than one cause of cough is frequently present.

Conclusion

Algorithms that provide a "road map" that the clinician can follow are useful and are presented for acute, subacute, and chronic cough.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f2c5d9c4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^c94ceebb]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic wet cough/protracted bacterial bronchitis in children — antibiotic efficacy and duration evidence indicate that three randomized controlled trials showed benefit with antibiotics, with number needed to treat for benefit by end of study 3 [95% CI, 2.0–4.3]; treatment durations ranged from 1 to 8 weeks, with prospective studies using 7 days to 2 weeks and retrospective studies 4–6 weeks and 6–8 weeks; overall, a 2-week course is generally sufficient but up to 4 weeks may be required in a minority of children; British Thoracic Society cough guidelines suggest 4 to 6 weeks, though this review did not identify prospective study-derived evidence for that duration; if chronic wet cough does not resolve after 4 weeks of appropriate oral antibiotics, one study reported an increased likelihood of CT scan-diagnosed bronchiectasis (adjusted OR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.2–28.5]).

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^78f895c5]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — definition, evidence, and panel suggestions are as follows: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria, and this study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo, while no eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner, and if the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^306dfc88]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients. Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Bronchiectasis, chronic suppurative lung disease and protracted bacterial bronchitis [^47f3e54c]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a structural airway disease characterized by dilated bronchi and bronchioles due to severe or recurrent lower airways inflammation. Bronchiectasis can occur as a result of chronic pulmonary aspiration. Bronchiectasis may also be associated with a wide variety of systemic diseases, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Children with bronchiectasis typically have a chronic or recurrent productive cough and carry a significant burden of disease with a considerable impact on quality of life. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made by high-resolution chest computerized tomography. Aggressive management of bronchiectasis is necessary to reduce the daily symptom burden and frequency of exacerbations. Chronic suppurative lung disease may be a precursor to bronchiectasis, only lacking the defining radiographic features of bronchiectasis. Children with chronic suppurative lung disease may have the same symptoms as children with bronchiectasis and should be treated similarly. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as a cough lasting at least four weeks that responds to antibiotic therapy. Protracted bacterial bronchitis may occur following a viral respiratory tract infection. Protracted bacterial bronchitis can be treated with a prolonged course of empiric antibiotics. Further evaluation is necessary if a child with suspected protracted bacterial bronchitis does not adequately respond to antibiotics as chronic suppurative lung disease or bronchiectasis must be considered.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a5481c17]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult cough classification and management suggestions state: For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that acute cough be defined as being < 3 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that subacute cough be defined as being between 3 and 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that chronic cough be defined as being > 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients seeking medical care complaining of cough, we suggest that estimating the duration of cough is the first step in narrowing the list of potential diagnoses (Grade 2C). For adult patients around the globe complaining of cough, we suggest that the cough be managed using evidence-based guidelines that are based upon duration of cough (Grade 2C).
