## Question

A 24 year old man comes in for annual well check. He is otherwise healthy, although has a history of anal warts which started at age 20. He is sexually active with other men, is not monogamous at this time, and his last HIV test was 8 months ago and negative. There is a small 1cm area of condyloma at the 3 o'clock position adjacent to the anus. The rest of his physical examination is entirely normal.

Which of the following is indicated for him?

Group of answer choices

Biopsy of the condyloma

Repeat HIV testing

Acetic acid test to the anal area

HPV vaccination

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single intervention is most indicated for a 24-year-old man with anal warts who is sexually active with men and whose last HIV test was 8 months ago. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's age and eligibility for HPV catch-up vaccination. Then, I should verify his HIV screening status and whether repeat testing is indicated now. Next, I will consider whether biopsy of the condyloma is warranted. After that, I need to check whether an acetic acid test adds diagnostic value here. Finally, I will weigh the evidence-based benefits of HPV vaccination in this exact scenario and confirm dosing and timing, before concluding with the most appropriate choice among the options provided.

> Let me first confirm age-based eligibility for HPV vaccination. At 24 years old, he falls squarely within the catch-up window; ACIP recommends catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 who are not adequately vaccinated, and this applies regardless of sexual orientation or prior HPV exposure, so he is eligible to receive the 9-valent HPV vaccine series now [^116BC19n] [^117V4vuf] [^111MCeUw].

> Wait, let me verify the HIV testing interval before jumping to conclusions. The CDC's STI screening guidance advises that sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men should have HIV screening at least annually, and more frequent testing (every 3–6 months) if they have multiple partners or other risk factors; his last test was 8 months ago, so he is due for repeat HIV testing now based on risk profile, even though the question asks for the single most indicated intervention among the listed options [^notfound].

> I need to check whether a biopsy of the condyloma is indicated. Biopsy is generally reserved for atypical-appearing lesions, lesions that are large, pigmented, indurated, ulcerated, refractory to therapy, or when malignancy is suspected; a small, classic 1 cm condyloma in a 24-year-old without red flags does not meet those criteria, so routine biopsy is not indicated here [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of acetic acid application. Acetic acid can transiently highlight HPV-associated mucosal lesions but has poor specificity and is not recommended as a diagnostic test for routine evaluation of external warts; it is more relevant in specialized settings such as high-resolution anoscopy, which is not indicated for a straightforward external condyloma in a young man without concerning features [^notfound].

> Let me consider the direct benefit of HPV vaccination in this patient. The 9-valent vaccine prevents infection with HPV 6 and 11, which cause 90% of anogenital warts, and also covers oncogenic types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; vaccination will not treat existing warts but will protect against new infections with these types going forward, which is particularly relevant for someone with ongoing sexual exposures and recurrent warts, and ACIP explicitly recommends catch-up through age 26 for all persons not previously vaccinated [^116BC19n] [^116U62cq] [^111MCeUw].

> I should double-check dosing and series completion. Because he is starting at age 24, he should receive a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months; no prevaccination testing is required, and vaccination can proceed regardless of prior HPV exposure or current warts, since the vaccine prevents future infections rather than treating existing disease [^117DYJpC] [^111u4dx9] [^1145Eq4P].

> But wait, what if I'm overemphasizing vaccination and missing a more urgent need? Repeat HIV testing is indeed indicated now given his risk profile, yet the question asks for the single best intervention among the listed choices; among biopsy, repeat HIV testing, acetic acid testing, and HPV vaccination, HPV vaccination is the only option that provides durable primary prevention of future HPV infections and aligns with a strong, age-based recommendation for this 24-year-old, whereas the other choices are either not indicated or are less impactful as a single intervention in this context [^116BC19n] [^115bJgXr].

> Final answer: HPV vaccination is indicated and should be offered now as a 3-dose 9-valent series, with counseling that it prevents future HPV infections but does not treat existing warts; arrange repeat HIV testing as well, but among the provided options, HPV vaccination is the most appropriate single intervention [^116BC19n] [^117DYJpC].

---

The most indicated next step is **HPV vaccination** [^116BC19n] because catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 for all who are not adequately vaccinated [^115bJgXr], regardless of prior HPV exposure or sexual history [^111MCeUw]. The 9-valent vaccine prevents new infections with HPV 6/11 (warts) and 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 (cancers) [^116U62cq], and vaccination is appropriate even with a history of warts [^1145Eq4P]. Repeat HIV testing is reasonable but not urgent; biopsy and acetic acid testing are not indicated for typical warts.

---

## Clinical indications for HPV vaccination

Current guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommend **catch-up HPV vaccination** for all individuals through age 26 who are not adequately vaccinated [^116BC19n] [^115bJgXr]. This recommendation applies regardless of sexual history, prior HPV exposure, or sexual orientation [^116Drd9v]. The vaccine is most effective when administered before sexual exposure, but it still provides benefit in sexually active individuals by preventing new HPV infections [^116BC19n].

---

## Relevance of HPV vaccination in patients with existing condyloma

Patients with existing condyloma have confirmed HPV exposure, but vaccination remains beneficial because it **prevents new infections** with HPV types not already acquired [^116BC19n]. The 9-valent HPV vaccine (**Gardasil 9**) protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause approximately 90% of anogenital warts, and against high-risk types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which are associated with anal and other HPV-related cancers [^116U62cq]. Therefore, vaccination can reduce the risk of new warts and future **HPV-related malignancies** [^113fWxBH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

ACIP and CDC guidelines explicitly recommend **catch-up HPV vaccination** through age 26 for all individuals not previously vaccinated, regardless of prior HPV exposure or sexual history [^116BC19n] [^111MCeUw]. The ACS similarly endorses catch-up vaccination through age 26 and emphasizes the importance of vaccination in **preventing HPV-related cancers** [^115bJgXr]. These guidelines apply to all individuals, including **men who have sex with men (MSM)**, who are at increased risk for HPV-related diseases [^1118JDtB] [^115EqLb3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting HPV vaccination in patients with existing condyloma

Clinical trials and observational studies demonstrate that HPV vaccination significantly reduces the incidence of new HPV infections, including those caused by types 6 and 11, even in individuals with prior HPV exposure [^113RNvYT]. While vaccination does not treat existing warts, it prevents new infections and reduces the risk of recurrent warts and HPV-related cancers [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other clinical options

- **Biopsy of the condyloma**: Biopsy is not indicated for typical, clinically diagnosed condyloma acuminatum. It is reserved for atypical lesions, lesions suspicious for malignancy, or those unresponsive to therapy.

- **Repeat HIV testing**: The patient's last HIV test was 8 months ago, and routine HIV screening is recommended annually for sexually active individuals. While repeat testing is reasonable, it is not the most urgent or impactful intervention in this scenario.

- **Acetic acid test**: Acetic acid application is primarily used to visualize subclinical lesions during high-resolution anoscopy or colposcopy. It is not indicated for routine evaluation of clinically apparent external warts.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's age, sexual history, and current clinical presentation, **HPV vaccination** is the most indicated intervention. It aligns with current guidelines, provides significant protection against new HPV infections, and reduces the risk of recurrent warts and HPV-related cancers. Therefore, the recommended course of action is to administer the 9-valent HPV vaccine series to the patient [^116BC19n] [^113sYPjh].

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

Methods

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available at. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged > 26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted 10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — age indications and adult decision-making — state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination guideline update: American cancer society guideline endorsement [^111SC2y8]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^1124223n]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — adults older than 26 years: ACIP indicates that catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years; instead, shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years. The ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27 through 45 years because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selecting individuals who might benefit. Supporting context notes that HPV vaccination is most effective in early adolescence, with effectiveness decreasing dramatically by age 18 years and minimal benefit noted by age 20 or 21 years, and that compared with vaccination through age 26 years, extending to adults through age 45 years was estimated to prevent only an additional 0.5% cases of cancer, 0.4% cases of cervical precancer, and 0.3% cases of genital warts over the next 100 years.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^116ANd6E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

In practice, HPV vaccination rates in many countries remain low.

Simpler HPV immunisation schedules have been identified as a potential strategy to increase the coverage of vaccination (Walling 2016). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a two‐dose HPV vaccine schedule in 2014, based on a systematic review of studies with immunogenicity as the end‐point (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017). As of 30 December 2017, 80 countries had fully introduced HPV vaccination and four countries had partially introduced HPV vaccination into their national immunisation programmes, with 65 countries having implemented a two‐dose schedule in girls 9 to 14 years old.

In 2018, a Cochrane Review concluded that the licensed three‐dose schedules of the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in limited adverse events and are effective against precancerous cervical lesions in females (Arbyn 2018). Since the 2014 WHO recommendation and original systematic review of two‐dose HPV vaccination schedules (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017), the evidence base from RCTs about alternative vaccination schedules has expanded to include more data about the nonavalent HPV vaccine (Iversen 2016), about HPV vaccination in males, including MSM (Giuliano 2011), and amongst people living with HIV infection (Toft 2014). This review was initially commissioned in 2016 by the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research to update the evidence for the two‐dose recommendation and is an update of D'Addario 2017. We produced a revised protocol for this update (Bergman 2017).

Cochrane Reviews usually include only RCTs with major clinical disease endpoints because RCTs provide the highest level of certainty about critical outcomes of interventions. However, precancer and cancer do not develop until many years after the acquisition of HPV infection, so it is difficult to determine the efficacy of vaccines against these outcomes. Persistent HPV infection is considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer to be sufficient as a surrogate marker for cervical and anal cancer and non‐inferiority of immunogenicity is sufficient to bridge results to under‐16‐year‐olds. It is therefore important to document all infection and immunological outcomes measured in RCTs of HPV vaccines, even if the intended use of the vaccine is to prevent cancer.

This review aims to extend the evidence base on the efficacy and harms of HPV vaccines by including and evaluating RCTs of different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules in adolescent and adult females and males, as well as women and men living with HIV infection.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

The results of this systematic review are in agreement with other published reviews on the efficacy of fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine (D'Addario 2017; Markowitz 2018). The current review aimed to provide further information on clinical outcomes and adverse events. This review provides evidence about other comparisons, such as vaccination of boys and comparisons across types of HPV vaccine, which have not previously been assessed.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^117VT7SM]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening — The combination of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cancers caused by HPV each year in this country and to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem in the coming decades. It is important that all individuals with a cervix, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, get screened according to current guidelines. Vaccination of all children between ages 9 and 12 years will prevent > 90% of the cervical, oropharyngeal, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers that are caused by HPV and, combined with screening and the treatment of cervical precancers, can lead to the first elimination of a cancer in history.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

ACIP routine HPV vaccination ages and ACS qualifying statement with rationale indicate that ACIP recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and that vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years, and ACS states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates and encourages providers to start the series at age 9 or 10 years. The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections affecting both men and women worldwide. The development of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant pharmaceutical innovation with potential to reduce HPV-related morbidity. However, barriers to the universal use and acceptability of the HPV vaccines continue to exist in both economically privileged and disadvantaged countries. It may be decades before the impact of preventive vaccines on HPV-related diseases caused by the considerable burden of HPV infections will be seen. Collaborative efforts must continue to promote vaccine implementation.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ongoing challenges and future directions [^115nEWwq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

Global HPV Vaccination Activities

Global HPV Vaccination Policies and Guidelines

Since 2005, CDC has provided technical support to WHO and its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in the development and revision of HPV vaccine policies and guidelines. CDC participated in WHO technical work groups providing expertise for the development of the first WHO position paper and recommendations for HPV vaccination that were released in 2009. CDC also assisted in the development of the 2010 WHO report focused on evaluating HPV vaccine coverage and providing guidance for HPV vaccine impact monitoring. In addition, CDC participated in a series of WHO meetings during 2013–2015 that were focused on revising guidelines for future HPV vaccine trials, including guidance on trial design and clinical endpoints for evaluation of new prophylactic HPV vaccines. As further data became available from vaccine trials, CDC provided ongoing consultation to WHO headquarters and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) when deliberations were under way for reduced-dose vaccination schedules and consideration of vaccination for boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of CDC has provided ongoing opportunities for policy makers from other countries to attend and learn from US deliberations on vaccine policy.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^113sYPjh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

### Risk factors for human papillomavirus infection and disease: a targeted literature summary [^113LeuDY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Adolescents are the primary cohort for routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, but unvaccinated adults may also benefit. A lack of consensus on which adults to target and the presence of reimbursement barriers likely contribute to the lag in adult vaccinations, highlighting missed prevention opportunities. Understanding factors contributing to risk of HPV infection and disease could help in decision making on vaccination. This review summarizes existing literature on risk factors for HPV infection and disease and includes 153 studies reporting relative risks or odds ratios for factors associated with HPV infection or disease in adults, published between 2009 and 2020. Despite inconsistent design and reporting of risk factors across studies, this review confirmed several risk factors associated with adult infection, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity, number of sex partners, and smoking. These findings can support policymaking, guideline development, and clinical decision making for HPV vaccination and screening of high-risk adult groups.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2017 [^117DYJpC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination. Healthy adolescents who start their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series before age 15 years are recommended to receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine. Adults and adolescents who did not start their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Changes in recommendations in the adult immunization schedule include updates regarding HPV vaccination for adults who did not complete the HPV vaccination series as adolescents. These changes are described in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years who have not received any HPV vaccine should receive a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated with a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received 2 doses at least 5 months apart are considered adequately vaccinated and do not need an additional dose of HPV vaccine.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received only 1 dose, or 2 doses less than 5 months apart, are not considered adequately vaccinated and should receive 1 additional dose of HPV vaccine.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^113Z7ERx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow-up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year-old females Antibody responses after two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low-certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and none in the two-dose group (0/899) (low-certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 14-year-old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low-certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10- to 26-year-old males In one RCT there was moderate-certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person-years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person-years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person-years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person-years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person-years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person-years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

S3 (one-dose routine vaccination targeting girls aged 14), S4 (one-dose routine vaccination of girls aged 14 years plus reverse multi-year catch-up at girls aged 9 years), and S5 (one-dose routine vaccination targeting girls aged 14 years plus multi-year catch-up at females aged 20 years) are additional vaccine allocation options when the off-label use schedule (i.e. one-dose schedule for females aged 9–20 years, and two-dose schedule for females ≥ 21 years) is possible immediately. The on-label schedule was assumed to provide 100% lifelong protection against vaccine-targeted HPV types. The off-label schedule was assumed to provide 85% lifelong protection against vaccine-targeted HPV types. Both the number of cases averted and the NNDs were undiscounted. A one-dose schedule was assumed to reduce the efficacy against both vaccine-target and cross-protective types by the same proportion. Bars indicate the accumulated number of cervical cancer cases averted over a 100-year time horizon by five strategies compared with no vaccination. Strategies with different vaccine types are indicated by different colors (dark blue for domestic HPV-2; green for imported HPV-2; light blue for HPV-4; purple for HPV-9).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117FvKr1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

HPV vaccine — product availability and timing: HPV vaccination prevents HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV. Although HPV vaccine is most effective in people with few or no sex partners prior to vaccination, HPV vaccination in people with multiple lifetime sex partners can still prevent HPV infection from subtypes they have not been exposed to yet. Three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved HPV vaccines are licensed: bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent; currently, only the 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV, protective against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) is available in the United States. Routine HPV vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years.

Results

Impact of vaccination strategies with constrained supply and on-label vaccine use scenario

Among the six two-dose routine vaccination strategies targeting girls aged 9–14 years, vaccinating 14-year-old girls would avert 94 393 to 686 144 additional cervical cancer cases compared with the other strategies targeting younger ages in the 100-year time horizon, and the health benefits would occur earlier (Fig. 1; appendix Table S7). This strategy would produce the lowest NNDs among the six routine vaccination strategies, ranging from 150 to 220 compared with no vaccination, depending on vaccine type (Fig. 2; appendix Table S7). Vaccinating girls aged 14 was cost-saving, and dominated (less costly and more effective than) all the other five two-dose routine vaccination strategies (net cost savings between $15 164 million to $22 034 million, ROIs between 7 and 14, depending on vaccine type) (Fig. 4; appendix Table S6; Fig. S7).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^112mfVwU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection, with HPV acquisition generally occurring soon after first sexual activity. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic. Persistent infections with high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types can lead to development of cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers, usually after several decades. Most new HPV infections occur in adolescents and young adults. Although most sexually active adults have been exposed to HPV, new infections can occur with a new sex partner.

Three prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the United States: 9-valent (9vHPV, Gardasil 9, Merck), quadrivalent (4vHPV, Gardasil, Merck), and bivalent (2vHPV, Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline). As of late 2016, only 9vHPV is distributed in the United States. The majority of HPV-associated cancers are caused by HPV 16 or 18, types targeted by all three vaccines. In addition, 4vHPV and 9vHPV target HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts. 9vHPV also protects against five additional high-risk types: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

In October 2018, using results from 4vHPV clinical trials in women aged 24 through 45 years, and bridging immunogenicity and safety data in women and men, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approved age range for 9vHPV use from 9 through 26 years to 9 through 45 years in women and men. In June 2019, after reviewing evidence related to HPV vaccination of adults, ACIP updated recommendations for catch-up vaccination and for vaccination of adults older than the recommended catch-up age.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116N9XwR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

HPV burden of disease and impact of the vaccination program in the United States. Approximately 33,700 cancers are caused by HPV in the United States each year, including 12,900 oropharyngeal cancers among men and women, 10,800 cervical cancers among women, and 6,000 anal cancers among men and women; vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers are less common. HPV vaccination for adolescents has been routinely recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. The existing HPV vaccination program for adolescents has the potential to prevent the majority of these cancers. Mean age at acquisition of causal HPV infection for cancers is unknown, but is estimated to be decades before cancer is diagnosed. In 2017, coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine was 65.5% among adolescents aged 13 through 17 years. Although coverage with the recommended number of doses remains below the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% for adolescents, the U.S. HPV vaccination program has resulted in significant declines in prevalences of vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical precancers. For example, prevalences of 4vHPV vaccine-type infection during 2013–2016, compared with those of the prevaccine era, declined from 11.5% to 1.8% among females aged 14 through 19 years and from 18.5% to 5.3% among females aged 20 through 24 years. In addition, declines have been observed among unvaccinated persons, suggesting protective herd effects.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — early initiation between ages 9 and 12 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended starting the series between ages 9 and 12 years. Evidence is emerging that series completion and acceptance may be higher when vaccination is initiated at age 9 or 10 years compared with age 11 or 12 years; in a primary care network, initiation by age 11 years increased from 4.6% to 60.8% within 18 months. In a large population-based cohort, 97.5% of children who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 or 10 years completed the series by age 13.5 years compared with 78.0% when initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted ACIP guidance and states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, and that health care providers are encouraged to start offering the series at age 9 or 10 years.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — prevention and recommendations: A 9-valent HPV vaccine protecting against HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58 is available, and targeting the additional strains over the quadrivalent vaccine is predicted to prevent an additional 464 cases of anal cancer annually. Compared with the quadrivalent vaccine, the 9-valent vaccine was noninferior for antibody response to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18, and its calculated efficacy was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.9–99.8) for prevention of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to these strains, with sustained efficacy and immunogenicity aiding prevention of HPV incidence after 10 years post-vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine use of the 9-valent vaccine in children aged 11 and 12 years and catch-up vaccination through 26 years of age for those not previously vaccinated; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded use to individuals aged 27 through 45 years, and in 2019 the ACIP voted to recommend vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making for individuals in this age range who are not adequately vaccinated.

### Recommendations on the use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in males – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2011 [^115TpL29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

On October 25, 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co. Inc.) in males aged 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommended vaccination with HPV4 for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. These recommendations replace the October 2009 ACIP guidance that HPV4 may be given to males aged 9 through 26 years. For these recommendations, ACIP considered information on vaccine efficacy (including data available since October 2009, on prevention of grade 2 or 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN2/3], a precursor of anal cancer), vaccine safety, estimates of disease and cancer resulting from HPV, cost-effectiveness, and programmatic considerations. The evidence for HPV4 vaccination of males was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine trials and tribulations: clinical perspectives [^114uN6Lm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and is associated with both benign and malignant neoplasms in men and women. It is a double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Forty HPV types are known to infect mucosal keratinocytes. If not cured by the immune system, the infection can lead to genital warts, mucosal dysplasia, or cancer. The most common oncogenic types are 16 and 18. The vaccine to prevent HPV and its associated morbidity and mortality has existed since 2006. Several variations protect against an increasing number of HPV types. The recommended vaccination age is before sexual exposure; administration of the vaccine to children has been controversial. This continuing medical education review evaluates the current HPV vaccines available to clinicians. Part I focuses on the debate over who should be vaccinated, at what age, and in which populations.

### Gaps and opportunities to improve prevention of human papillomavirus-related cancers [^112yXJRD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary Prevention through HPV Vaccination

HPV vaccination has been available in the United States since 2006 and is currently the most effective method of preventing infection. The latest nonavalent vaccine targets seven of the high-risk types detected in ∼90% of HPV-related cancers (Table 1). While vaccine-type HPV infection rates in both women and men have decreased since the initial introduction of the vaccine, vaccine implementation in the United States remains relatively low and inconsistent across genders, ages, regions, and racial and ethnic subgroups. Current guidelines recommend vaccinations for everyone through age 26, yet, in 2020, only 58.6% of adolescents were up-to-date on their HPV vaccination, despite CDC's recent reiteration of its previous guidelines recommending girls and boys ages 11 and 12 receive the vaccine.

The clinical and cost effectiveness of the nonavalent HPV vaccine as a public health tool has helped mitigate the barriers of individual patient costs and insurance coverage toward reaching national vaccine uptake goals. Federal assistance programs like Vaccines for Children have also been instrumental in improving access and reducing socioeconomic disparities seen for vaccinations against HPV, as it has for other vaccines such as diphtheria–tetanus–acellular pertussis and measles–mumps–rubella. Health departments charged with managing local program implementation should collaborate with recognized leaders of professional and community organizations to build public awareness and educate their constituents about vaccine safety and access. Altogether, they can combine efforts to ensure that health care providers, such as primary care physicians and pediatricians, are registered to participate in such programs, especially in underserved areas. Barring systemic challenges of costs and access, individuals must still choose to receive the HPV vaccine as a preventive measure for their health.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1145Eq4P]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800–232–4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

Introduction

Every clinical encounter is an opportunity to vaccinate. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted in-person encounters, leading to delays in childhood vaccinations across different seasonal patterns. Historically, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has lagged behind other adolescent vaccinations. Strategies to catch up by offering vaccines at every encounter starting at age 9 years, and prioritizing population subgroups are needed. We characterized HPV vaccination by age and season from 2019 to 2021 and compared vaccination by encounter before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify catch-up priority groups.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^112ZDGzQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During its February 2015 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) (Gardasil 9, Merck and Co. Inc.) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination (Table 1). HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously. Vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV is a noninfectious, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Similar to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), 9vHPV contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs. In addition, 9vHPV contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs. 9vHPV was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 2014, for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years. For these recommendations, ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males. Bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females. This report summarizes evidence considered by ACIP in recommending 9vHPV as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for vaccination and provides recommendations for vaccine use.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^113RNvYT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary of Key Findings

Vaccine efficacy and safety. Data were considered from 11 clinical trials of 9vHPV, 4vHPV, and/or 2vHPV in adults aged 27 through 45 years, along with supplemental bridging immunogenicity data. In per-protocol analyses from three trials, 4vHPV and 2vHPV demonstrated significant efficacy against a combined endpoint of persistent vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 (low-grade lesions) or worse. In nine trials, seroconversion rates to vaccine-type HPV after 3 doses of any HPV vaccine were 93.6%–100% at 7 months after the first dose. Overall evidence on benefits was GRADE evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In nine trials, few serious adverse events and no vaccine-related deaths were reported. Overall evidence on harms was also GRADE evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In the efficacy trial that was the basis for 9vHPV licensure for adults through age 45 years, per-protocol efficacy of 4vHPV among women aged 24 through 45 years was 88.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 78.1–94.8), and intention-to-treat efficacy was 47.2% (95% CI = 33.5–58.2) against a combined endpoint of persistent infections, extragenital lesions, and CIN 1+ related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18.

### CDC activities for improving implementation of human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and surveillance worldwide [^112ApqeS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The discovery of the strong causal relationship between persistent infections with oncogenic HPV types and cervical cancer has led to development of HPV vaccines to prevent infection by oncogenic HPV types, and HPV tests that are being used to improve cervical cancer screening. Currently, 3 HPV vaccines have been developed: a bivalent vaccine that protects against HPV-16 and HPV-18; a quadrivalent vaccine that protects against HPV-16, HPV-18, and nononcogenic HPV types 6 and 11; and a 9-valent vaccine that protects against those in the quadrivalent vaccine and 5 additional oncogenic HPV types (HPV-31, -33, -45, -52, and -58).

The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccination for girls 9–14 years of age in all countries where cervical cancer prevention is a public health priority and introduction is feasible and sustainable. WHO also recommends vaccination of multiple age cohorts (e.g. 9–14 years) in the first year of introduction, if feasible for the country. HPV vaccination has been introduced in 71 (37%) countries worldwide; however, most developing countries with higher cervical cancer incidence rates have not yet introduced HPV vaccination. CDC is working with various partners to assist in development of global HPV vaccination policies and guidelines, and provide technical assistance in implementation and evaluation of country HPV vaccination pilot projects or programs.

Research on HPV vaccines is ongoing in several areas. There is interest in evaluating the efficacy of less than three doses, and further data may be available on these schedules in the future. In addition, second-generation vaccines that target additional HPV types are being developed. Current data suggest good duration of protection afforded by the currently approved bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, and ongoing studies will provide further data. Monitoring of vaccine safety is part of routine activities of the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC, and current data are reassuring. A recent evaluation of quadrivalent HPV vaccine after the administration of more than 600,000 doses in girls and women found no statistically significant increased rate of prespecified adverse events. Safety monitoring of HPV vaccines will continue to investigate potential rare outcomes.

Early detection of cervical and noncervical cancers associated with HPV infection also deserves brief comment. For cervical cancers, the ACS and multiple clinical organizations, as well as the US Preventive Services Task Force, have recently issued updated age-specific guidelines for cytologic and HPV testing for the early detection of cervical cancer. These guidelines addressed critical issues about the harms of unnecessary procedures and treatments associated with transient HPV infections and associated cervical lesions, which regress without medical intervention. In addition, as HPV vaccination coverage levels increase, cervical cancer screening recommendations may need to be modified. The efficacy of anal Pap testing to reduce mortality from HPV-associated anal cancer is unknown, and no national guidelines exist for anal cytology among men or women with or without HIV infection, although one study found it to be both clinically and cost effective to conduct such testing among HIV-positive gay and bisexual men.

As incidence rates for some HPV-associated cancers continue to rise, these cases will contribute to the overall growing number of cancers associated with population aging and expansion, requiring additional resources for medical research and treatment. Continued monitoring of incidence and mortality trends for all cancers is warranted to inform cancer prevention and control policies and programs.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^116sTm8x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included RCTs with no language restrictions. We included unpublished studies, studies in press, and abstracts without a full‐text publication, if they met the inclusion criteria.

Types of participants

Females or males aged 9 to 26 years, including MSM. For the comparisons among people living with HIV, we included all age groups.

Types of interventions

Prophylactic administration of licensed bivalent (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), or nonavalent (Gardasil 9, Merck) HPV vaccines. We excluded studies if they assessed monovalent or plasmid vaccines, or assessed non‐prophylactic uses of bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccines. In addition, we considered for inclusion any trials reporting on the efficacy, immunogenicity, or adverse events in vaccines currently in phase 2 or 3 development. Studies comparing bivalent versus quadrivalent vaccines were excluded, as these will be included in an update of a separate Cochrane Review (Arbyn 2018).

For males and people living with HIV, we included comparisons of HPV vaccines to placebo containing no adjuvant or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, or another HPV vaccine.

In this review, we use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products that contain another vaccine or only vaccine adjuvants, regardless of the terminology used in individual study reports. We use the term 'placebo' only to refer to comparator products containing no adjuvant or active vaccine. In Characteristics of included studies we have reported full details of the type of comparison group compound.

The focus of the review was on different dose schedules and comparisons between different types of HPV vaccine. Where possible we stratified data by participant characteristics of age, gender, and HIV status. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of:

fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females and males;
different intervals between doses in a two‐dose schedule in females and males;
HPV vaccination compared to control for males (a Cochrane Review for females has been published (Arbyn 2018));
nonavalent HPV vaccine compared to the other HPV vaccines in females and males;
HPV vaccination in people living with HIV.

Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years, and women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV.

### An update on human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^113eX7W8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer remains a significant disease in the United States. Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved for those aged 9–26 years and for some individuals up to age 45 years, there are many circumstances in which health care professionals may not know whether the vaccine should be recommended, such as for patients with previous infection, health care workers, and those older than age 26 years. This article highlights the evidence that the HPV vaccine is a safe and highly effective way to prevent cervical cancer, with the strongest predictor of vaccine uptake being practitioner recommendation.

### FDA licensure of bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV2, cervarix) for use in females and updated HPV vaccination recommendations from the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1165VjTt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On October 16, 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV2; Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) for use in females aged 10 through 25 years. Cervarix is the second human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed for use in females in the United States. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co, Inc.) was licensed in 2006 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine HPV4 vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years, and catch-up vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years. This report provides updated recommendations for routine and catch-up vaccination of females with either HPV2 or HPV4.

Prevention

Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers caused by HPV. The 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV vaccines protect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, although the 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also protect against the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe and effective and are recommended routinely for adolescents aged 11–12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also recommended for older adolescents and young adults through age 26 years. Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain adults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated per guidance.
Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the chances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing HPV-related diseases (e.g. genital warts or cervical cancer). However, because HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom, condoms might not fully protect against HPV.
Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk for HPV. However, even persons with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV.
Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^113HLZWE]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review followed a protocol published in the Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration no. CRD42016038965) and was reported according to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. To be eligible, a study had to investigate the efficacy, effectiveness and/or safety of vaccination (with a licensed vaccine) against HPV in males of any age. The control group had to be males who were either unvaccinated or had received placebo or a vaccine not directed against HPV. An eligible study had to report on at least one of the following predefined outcomes: (1) incident oral infection with an HR HPV type; (2) incident anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type; (3) persisting oral infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (4) persisting anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (5) condyloma acuminatum (genital or anal) due to HPV 6 or 11; (6) anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade 2; (7) AIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (8) penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grade 2; (9) PIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (10) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region, including the oropharynx, larynx and oral cavity; (11) epithelial dysplasia related to (10); and (12) any severe adverse event following immunization. As we were primarily interested in clinical relevance, we did not restrict ourselves to vaccine-type specific lesions only.

The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (date of initial search 4 November 2016; last update 18 April 2017). For details on the complete search strategy, see Additional file 1. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was searched systematically for unpublished or ongoing trials. Electronic searches were complemented by manually screening conference abstract books of major international HPV conferences (EUROGIN 2016, International HPV Conference 2017) as well as reference lists of all identified studies and those of identified reviews. Search results (titles, abstracts, full texts) were independently assessed by two investigators (TH, MWP). Differences were discussed until a consensus was reached.

We did not make any restrictions with regard to setting, language or publication status (published/unpublished). Potential indirect effects of male HPV vaccination on the incidence of clinical outcomes in females were not considered in this review.

CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR HPV VACCINATION

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) recommends following current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for HPV vaccination. These guidelines state that routine HPV vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 11 to 12 years but may start at age 9. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for individuals through age 26 who were not previously vaccinated. Individuals aged between 27 and 45 years can be offered the vaccine using shared clinical decision making between providers and previously unvaccinated patients who are most likely to benefit. There are no current age-based recommendations for HPV vaccination for individuals aged older than 45 years; the vaccine is not Food and Drug Administration-approved in this age range. The HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, but is safe for use during lactation. In addition to these CDC guidelines, ASCCP issued a statement in February 2020 recommending HPV vaccination for medical professionals who are routinely exposed to the virus through their occupation.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114JH6B7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection — vaccination recommendations for people with HIV state that HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and to administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII); ideally, the series should have been initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years, and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For all people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years who were not vaccinated previously, administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII), and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For people with HIV aged 27 to 45 years who were not adequately vaccinated previously, HPV vaccine is not routinely recommended; instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people who may be at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For people who were adequately vaccinated with bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with 9-valent HPV vaccine, but data are lacking to define the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII). HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII).

### HPV vaccine acceptability among men: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YS1c4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

HPV vaccination for men

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil) was licensed in the United States for men in 2009. In 2011 the US Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices approved and recommended routine use of HPV4 for boys aged 11–21 years, with approval for administration up to age 26 years, in order to prevent genital warts and anal cancer.HPV4 is recommended for MSM through age 26 years. HPV4 is over 90% effective in preventing a variety of types of HPV infection and genital warts in young men. It has also demonstrated efficacy among MSM in preventing anal epithelial neoplasias that are precursors to anal cancer.

Nevertheless, substantial debate surrounds HPV4 vaccination programmes for men. Based on mathematical models suggesting that male HPV4 vaccination programmes exceed cost-effectiveness thresholds, many European countries do not include men in HPV vaccination programmes, as in the United States, Canada and Australia, instead focusing on achieving expanded coverage among women to promote herd immunity. Support for male HPV4 vaccination programmes is based on evidence of substantial clinical benefits to men, cost-effectiveness among MSM, largely excluded from mathematical models, increased cost-effectiveness for men with the addition of non-cervical outcomes to mathematical models, and benefits of a gender-neutral (universal) approach to vaccination. Furthermore, most mathematical models calling into question the cost-effectiveness of male HPV4 vaccination presume 70% or greater coverage among women, an estimate that is not supported by data from the United States (three-dose coverage in women ∼32%)and many European countries.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — people with HIV should receive routine HPV vaccination using the 9-valent inactivated recombinant vaccine (Gardasil 9, Merck). Routine HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV. Ideally, the series should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years. For all people with HIV who are aged 13 to 26 years and who were not vaccinated previously, regardless of sex, administer three doses of the recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII). The two-dose series is not recommended for people with HIV. Shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV who are aged 27 to 45 years and who were not adequately vaccinated previously (AIII). At present, vaccination with commercially available HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII). For people who have completed a vaccination series with the recombinant HPV bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine, but data are lacking for defining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII).

Data synthesis

When pooling was considered feasible, we employed a random‐effects meta‐analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that effect size might vary across studies and settings. We used data from the last available follow‐up for clinical and adverse event outcomes, with the number of participants (rather than the number of events) used in the analysis. For immunological outcomes, we extracted data from one month after the last HPV dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up.

To assess the harms associated with the HPV vaccine comparisons in this review, we recorded the methods used in each included study to collect adverse event data, and extracted data on common events that we determined a priori as: pain, swelling, redness at the injection site and overall systemic adverse events. For all serious adverse events reported in the included studies, we extracted the number of participants, participants with events and a description of the events. We also extracted information on whether the serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccines. We did not conduct statistical hypothesis testing because our protocol did not prespecify hypotheses about differences in the occurrence of any specific serious adverse event.

### Committee opinion no. 641: human papillomavirus vaccination [^114hx8vS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the development of anogenital cancer (including cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal), oropharyngeal cancer, and genital warts. Human papillomavirus vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of anogenital cancer and genital warts. Despite the benefits of HPV vaccines, only approximately one third of girls in the recommended age group have received all three vaccines. Compared with other vaccines recommended in the same age bracket, HPV vaccination rates in the United States are unacceptably low. It is crucial that obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers educate parents and patients on the benefits and safety of HPV vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend routine vaccination with HPV vaccine for girls and boys. The 9-valent HPV vaccine is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2014 for girls and boys aged 11–12 years.

### HPV update: vaccination, screening, and associated disease [^114BL13K]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the causative agent in cervical cancer, and is associated with numerous other genital cancers, including vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer. Primary prevention with HPV vaccination is safe and efficacious, and a recently approved HPV vaccine will provide even more extensive protection against several oncogenic HPV strains. Screening strategies for HPV are rapidly evolving, reflecting the essential role that HPV infection plays in cervical cancer. This article highlights new evidence regarding the efficacy of the recently approved 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine and the use of primary high-risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening. We consider the utility of urinary HPV testing in routine clinical practice and review current guidelines regarding anal HPV screening.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination uptake in low-and middle-income countries: a meta-analysis [^111moKH6]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are four vaccines against the HPV: the quadrivalent (4vHPV) Gardasil approved in 2006, bivalent (2vHPV) Cervarix approved in 2010, 9-valent (9vHPV) Gardasil-9 approved in 2014 and the bivalent Cecolin approved in China in 2019. All vaccines are effective against the high-risk HPV 16/18 while Gardasil has additional coverage against HPV 6/11 and Gardasil-9 against HPV 6/11/31/33/45/52/58. A meta-analysis of the population-level impact of HPV vaccination for 5–8 years in fourteen high-income countries reported that the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased by 83% among girls aged 13–19 years and by 66% among women aged 20–24 years with significant cross-protection from HPV 31, 33 and 45. It also reported a decrease in the prevalence of anogenital wart by 67% among girls aged 15–19 years, by 54% among women aged 20–24 years and by 31% among women aged 25–29 years; by 48% among boys aged 15–19 years and by 48% among men aged 20–24 years. This meta-analysis also demonstrated that after 5–9 years of vaccination, the prevalence of CIN2+, a pre-cancerous stage, decreased by 51% among screened girls aged 15–19 years and by 31% among women aged 20–24 years.

### Direct benefit of vaccinating boys along with girls against oncogenic human papillomavirus: Bayesian evidence synthesis [^115EqLb3]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implemented in many countries with the specific aim of protecting women against cervical cancer. Inclusion of boys into vaccination programmes for girls is expected to provide some benefit to women, although the benefit will be small if programmes already achieve high coverage among girls. Protection of women should, however, not be the sole public health objective of HPV vaccination because men are also at risk of vaccine preventable cancers. Accumulation of evidence for the role of HPV in the aetiology of cancer in non-cervical sites, and demonstration that HPV vaccine is also effective in preventing non-cervical lesions in men as well as women, have prompted initiatives to vaccinate not only girls but also boys against HPV. Currently, Australia is the only country with a publicly funded HPV immunisation campaign for men.

An often cited obstacle to male HPV vaccination is the prohibitive cost. An economic assessment based on market introduction prices concluded that inclusion of boys in the immunisation programme in the United States exceeded conventional thresholds of cost effective interventions. Vaccine prices, however, have declined since market introduction, and cost requirements need not deter universal vaccination today, even though HPV vaccines are still expensive relative to other vaccines. To decide whether boys should be offered HPV vaccination, we need to assess the burden of HPV associated disease in men and how much of this will be prevented by vaccination of girls. Unless vaccination of girls will eliminate vaccine-type HPV infection from the population, men will remain vulnerable to vaccine preventable cancers, especially men who have sex with men, who are disproportionately affected by HPV related cancer.

The burden of HPV associated cancer in men derives primarily from neoplasms in the anogenital and head and neck regions. The connection between an anogenital or oral HPV infection and history of sexual behaviour is well established in epidemiological studies. In particular, men who have sex with men are, compared with heterosexual men, at high risk for oral and anal HPV infections, though not for penile HPV infections. Hence, men who have sex with men are at increased risk particularly for anal cancer, especially when they also have HIV.

7 UPDATEDRECOMMENDATIONS, GLOBAL EFFORTS, AND LESSONS FROM‐19

In light of the emerging evidence, WHO now recommends flexible HPV vaccination schedules: a one‐ or two‐dose schedule for girls aged 9–14 years, a one‐ or two‐dose schedule for girls and women aged 15–20 years, and a two‐dose schedule, with a 6‐month interval, for women aged over 21 years. The December 2022 WHO position paper highlighted that immunocompromised individuals, including those living with HIV, should receive a minimum of two doses and, where feasible, three doses. The primary target group for HPV vaccination remains girls aged 9–14 years, ideally before sexual debut, while secondary target groups, including boys and older girls, are encouraged to be vaccinated when practical and financially viable.

Several countries, including Australia, Scotland, and the UK, have adopted a single‐dose vaccination strategy. In September 2023, the UK transitioned to a single‐dose schedule for the National Health Service routine adolescent immunization, targeting schoolchildren aged 12–13 years. Eligible gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men under the age of 25 years will likewise receive a one‐dose schedule through sexual health clinics while those aged 25–45 years will continue with a two‐dose schedule. Immunosuppressed individuals, including those living with HIV, will adhere to a three‐dose schedule. In addition, eligible individuals may participate in a catch‐up vaccination until their 25th birthday through their general practitioners. Currently, 37 countries have reported switching or intent to switch to a one‐dose regimen.
