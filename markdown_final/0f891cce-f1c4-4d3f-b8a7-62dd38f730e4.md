## Question

Difference between prometrium vs micronized progesterone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between Prometrium and micronized progesterone, and whether there is a meaningful distinction to guide clinical use and counseling about safety, routes, and evidence bases across indications such as menopausal therapy and reproductive medicine outcomes like IVF and miscarriage prevention [^111MQy1D] [^115UujVD] [^115Myhi4] [^113NtSSQ].

> Let me first confirm the basic definitions so I don't anchor on marketing language rather than pharmacology and labeling, because I need to ensure I'm distinguishing a brand name from the active ingredient and its various routes and products; Prometrium is the FDA‑approved brand of oral micronized progesterone, whereas "micronized progesterone" refers to the same chemical entity formulated into small particles and can appear in multiple dosage forms, including oral capsules, vaginal gel or suppositories, and intramuscular injection, so chemically they are the same hormone but not the same product or route [^116QWSaj] [^115UujVD] [^113VPJF5].

> Wait, let me verify a point I've seen misquoted in some SPL summaries; I initially thought the labeling shorthand "progesterone (also known as Prometrium, Crinone)" meant both products were oral, but hold on, that's not correct — Crinone is a bioadhesive vaginal gel product and its labeling and adverse event profile are vaginal, not oral, whereas Prometrium is the oral capsule, so I should correct that mistaken inference and keep route specificity clear going forward [^115UujVD] [^115RdUGP] [^116QWSaj].

> Next, I should review regulatory status and quality because patients often ask if "micronized progesterone" from a compounding pharmacy is different or "more natural"; I need to emphasize that Prometrium is an FDA‑approved, standardized oral micronized progesterone with established dose, bioavailability, and safety, while compounded micronized progesterone preparations are not FDA‑reviewed for quality, dose uniformity, or clinical efficacy and may have inadequate or inconsistent bioavailability and endometrial protection, so the distinction is regulatory and quality‑control, not chemical [^112herxj] [^112Bwetc] [^114EvEyq].

> I will now examine the available formulations and routes because route alters pharmacokinetics and clinical utility; oral micronized progesterone (Prometrium) undergoes first‑pass metabolism and is used for indications like endometrial protection in menopausal hormone therapy, whereas vaginal micronized progesterone products such as Crinone deliver higher local endometrial exposure with lower systemic levels, and intramuscular progesterone is another approved route used in certain settings, so "micronized progesterone" spans different delivery systems beyond Prometrium [^111MQy1D] [^115UujVD] [^113VPJF5].

> Let me think about clinical use patterns next, and I should double‑check the labeled dosing where applicable; for menopausal therapy, oral micronized progesterone is commonly used with estrogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia at 200 mg nightly for 12 days per cycle in non‑hysterectomized patients, while in assisted reproduction and early pregnancy support, vaginal micronized progesterone is typically preferred due to local endometrial effects and avoidance of first‑pass metabolism, so the clinical niche often follows the route's pharmacology [^111MQy1D] [^115Myhi4] [^115UujVD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking labels; oral micronized progesterone has well‑described common adverse effects like somnolence, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and its SPL warnings include thromboembolic and cerebrovascular events, whereas vaginal products tend to produce local genitourinary and application‑site effects with lower systemic exposure, but I should be cautious in implying risk equivalence to estrogen‑progestin trials, since those risks are primarily driven by the estrogen‑progestin combination and not isolated progesterone, so counseling should remain label‑based and individualized [^116QWSaj] [^114ACEmH] [^111p3iNZ] [^115RdUGP].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic distinctions because they explain the route‑specific uses; oral progesterone has intrinsically poor bioavailability due to lipophilicity and extensive first‑pass hepatic metabolism, micronization improves but does not eliminate this, whereas vaginal administration leverages a uterine first‑pass effect yielding higher endometrial levels relative to systemic exposure, which is why vaginal formulations dominate in luteal‑phase support and early pregnancy indications, and development efforts like the E2/P4 fixed‑dose capsule were specifically aimed at optimizing oral bioavailability under FDA standards rather than relying on compounded mixtures [^113PdyLb] [^117VwNRA] [^114EvEyq].

> Next, I should review the reproductive medicine evidence so I don't overstate any one protocol; for IVF luteal phase support, progesterone is necessary, but optimal regimens vary, and contemporary trials suggest that adding oral dydrogesterone to vaginal micronized progesterone may be non‑superior to vaginal progesterone alone in mild stimulation settings, and Cochrane syntheses confirm progesterone's role but acknowledge heterogeneity and lack of a single best protocol, so conclusions should be tailored to the stimulation approach and patient factors [^114JiEm2] [^114DpxjG] [^115Myhi4] [^111Lm1dH].

> But wait, what if the question is really about miscarriage prevention details; I should confirm that key RCTs like PROMISE and PRISM used vaginal micronized progesterone, not oral Prometrium, and that benefit signals are concentrated in women with early pregnancy bleeding and a history of prior miscarriages, with guideline recommendations reflecting that subgroup by advising 400 mg vaginal micronized progesterone twice daily at bleeding presentation through 16 weeks, so route and population specificity matter for translating evidence [^115LcN9D] [^116GwXBb] [^113NtSSQ] [^116nxPqt].

> Final synthesis, and let me reconsider to ensure no gaps remain; there is no chemical difference between Prometrium and micronized progesterone since Prometrium is a branded, FDA‑approved oral micronized progesterone capsule, but meaningful differences arise from regulatory status and quality control of the product, the route of administration with distinct pharmacokinetics and adverse‑event profiles, and the clinical contexts in which a given route is supported by evidence, so counseling should clarify that the active hormone is identical while brand, route, and regulatory oversight drive clinical performance and safety [^111MQy1D] [^115UujVD] [^112herxj] [^114EvEyq].

Prometrium is an **FDA-approved oral capsule** of micronized progesterone in peanut oil [^114EvEyq], used for endometrial protection in hormone therapy [^111MQy1D] and for secondary amenorrhea [^112KRErf]. "Micronized progesterone" refers to the same active hormone in various formulations (oral, vaginal, injectable) [^115UujVD] [^113VPJF5], including compounded products [^112Bwetc]. The key differences are that Prometrium is a standardized, regulated product with defined indications and dosing [^115yaFGQ], while "micronized progesterone" is a general term that includes non-FDA-approved compounded products with variable quality and bioavailability [^113PdyLb]. Clinically, **Prometrium is preferred for oral use** due to its proven safety and efficacy, whereas compounded micronized progesterone should be used cautiously because of inconsistent dosing and limited evidence [^112herxj] [^112Bwetc].

---

## Chemical composition and formulation

Prometrium contains **micronized progesterone** suspended in **peanut oil** [^114EvEyq], with gelatin, glycerin, and titanium dioxide, and is available as **100 mg and 200 mg oral capsules**. "Micronized progesterone" refers to progesterone processed into fine particles to enhance absorption [^113PdyLb] and is available in oral, vaginal, and injectable formulations [^115UujVD] [^113VPJF5], including compounded products [^112Bwetc].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability

Oral Prometrium undergoes significant **first-pass metabolism** [^113PdyLb], generating metabolites such as allopregnanolone that can cause sedation and dizziness [^114Eypod]. Vaginal administration of micronized progesterone **bypasses first-pass metabolism**, leading to higher local uterine concentrations and fewer systemic side effects [^115KKC1E].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Indication** | **Prometrium** | **Micronized progesterone** |
|-|-|-|
| Endometrial hyperplasia prevention | Yes (200 mg orally for 12 days) [^111MQy1D] | Yes (oral or vaginal) [^115yaFGQ] [^111wp1ZX] |
| Secondary amenorrhea | Yes (oral) [^112KRErf] | Yes (oral or vaginal) [^112KRErf] |
| Luteal phase support in ART | No | Yes (vaginal) [^115Myhi4] |
| Prevention of preterm birth | No | Yes (vaginal) [^116dvAEn] |
| Hormone replacement therapy | Yes (oral) [^111MQy1D] | Yes (oral or vaginal) [^116P3aWU] |

---

## Safety and side effects

Prometrium commonly causes dizziness, drowsiness, headache, breast tenderness, and bloating; rare risks include thromboembolism [^114ACEmH] and **allergic reactions due to peanut oil** [^114EvEyq]. Vaginal administration of micronized progesterone may cause local irritation or discharge [^115RdUGP]. Compounded products may have **inconsistent dosing and unknown risks** [^112Bwetc] [^113PdyLb].

---

## Regulatory status

Prometrium is **FDA-approved** [^111MQy1D], standardized, and regulated. "Micronized progesterone" includes FDA-approved products [^115UujVD] and **compounded formulations** that are **not FDA-approved** and may vary in quality [^112Bwetc] [^113PdyLb].

---

## Clinical considerations

Prometrium is **preferred for oral administration** because of standardized dosing and proven safety. Micronized progesterone is **preferred for vaginal administration**, particularly in ART [^115Myhi4] and preterm birth prevention [^116dvAEn], owing to higher local concentrations and fewer systemic side effects [^115KKC1E].

---

Prometrium is an FDA-approved oral capsule of micronized progesterone [^111MQy1D], while "micronized progesterone" refers to the same hormone in various formulations, including compounded products [^112Bwetc]. The main differences are in **formulation, administration route, and regulatory status**, which influence clinical use and safety [^113PdyLb].

In contrast, compounded HT is not reviewed and approved by the FDA, and makers of compounded HT are not required to conduct the costly trials needed to prove the safety and efficacy of the medications they create. Compounded hormones that have inadequate bioavailability or do not contain the correct amounts of estrogens and progestogen may fail to protect the uterus. Several studies that evaluated compounded transdermal progesterone creams and gels in postmenopausal women observed posttreatment serum levels of progesterone far below the luteal level of 5 ng/mL.

- **Wren et al. report**: Serum levels of progesterone similar to baseline levels among 21 women treated with a 100-μg estradiol patch plus up to 64 mg of progesterone cream daily for three 28-day cycles. In addition, a biopsy after cycle 3 showed that 13 women developed endometrial proliferation during the study.

- **Vashisht et al. treat**: Postmenopausal women (N = 54) with a compounded cream delivering progesterone 40 mg/day and with a compounded gel delivering estradiol 1 mg/day for 48 weeks. Biopsy results at the study's conclusion showed that the progesterone had provided insufficient endometrial protection for 32% of participants: 27% had endometrial proliferation and 5% had complex hyperplasia.

Many US women turned to compounded HT after findings from the Women's Health Initiative indicated that the risks of HT (used to prevent chronic diseases) outweighed its benefits. Surveys suggested that some women have been persuaded by marketing claims from compounding pharmacies that compounded hormones — also sometimes referred…

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^111wAufB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

In the Tomic et al. study, a short agonist protocol was used, which can lead to a more compromised luteal phase due to not only the higher level of circulating oestradiol but also a decreased pituitary secretion in the luteal phase. This peculiarity could, in part, explain the higher pregnancy rates and live birth rates (LBR) observed in combined supplementation groups in Tomic (2011) and De (2023). Differently, the results of our study, where two supplementation protocols (combined vs. vaginal alone) were used in a mild stimulation protocol with lower oestradiol levels, show no statistical differences in terms of clinical outcomes.

The efficiency of oral dydrogesterone alone compared with vaginal micronized progesterone in luteal phase support is still under evaluation. Barbosa et al. (2018), in a meta-analysis of seven papers, concluded that oral dydrogesterone shows comparable clinical outcomes to vaginal micronized progesterone. The studies evaluated in this meta-analysis considered different stimulation protocols (long GnRH agonist protocols and GnRH antagonist protocols) and different clinical settings (frozen embryo transfers and fresh embryo transfers). In contrast, a more recent meta-analysis by Griesinger et al. (2020) concluded that higher pregnancy rates and live birth rates may be observed in women receiving oral dydrogesterone compared to vaginal micronized progesterone for luteal phase support. This meta-analysis also took into account papers evaluating different ovarian stimulation protocols and different clinical settings.

### Luteal phase support for assisted reproduction cycles [^111Lm1dH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Progesterone prepares the endometrium for pregnancy by stimulating proliferation in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the corpus luteum. This occurs in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In assisted reproduction techniques (ART), the progesterone or hCG levels, or both, are low, and the natural process is insufficient, so the luteal phase is supported with either progesterone, hCG, or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Luteal phase support improves implantation rates and thus pregnancy rates, but the ideal method is still unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2004 (Daya 2004).

- **Objectives**: To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of methods of luteal phase support in subfertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), LILACS, conference abstracts on the ISI Web of Knowledge, OpenSigle for grey literature from Europe, and ongoing clinical trials registered online. The final search was in February 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of luteal phase support in ART investigating progesterone, hCG, or GnRH agonist supplementation with in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Quasi-randomised trials and trials using frozen transfers or donor oocyte cycles were excluded.

### Prempro [^111Wq3s1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Effects on vasomotor symptoms**: In the first year of the Health and Osteoporosis, Progestin and Estrogen (HOPE) Study, a total of 2,805 postmenopausal women (average age 53.3 ± 4.9 years) were randomly assigned to one of eight treatment groups of either placebo or CE, with or without MPA. Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of symptomatic women (n = 241) who had at least seven moderate to severe hot flushes daily, or at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. With PREMPRO 0.625 mg/2.5 mg, 0.45 mg/1.5 mg, and 0.3 mg/1.5 mg, the relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms was shown to be statistically improved compared to placebo at weeks 4 and 12. The table indicating the adjusted mean number of hot flushes in the PREMPRO 0.625 mg/2.5 mg, 0.45 mg/1.5 mg, 0.3 mg/1.5 mg, and placebo groups during the initial 12-week period is no longer available.

- **Effects on vulvar and vaginal atrophy**: Results of vaginal maturation indexes at cycles 6 and 13 showed that the differences from placebo were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all treatment groups.

### Comparison of oral dydrogesterone and 17-α hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the prevention of preterm birth [^115TLQLG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

We did not compare dydrogesterone and 17α-OHPC with vaginal or oral micronized progesterone. However, a previous study compared daily vaginal micronized progesterone (200 mg) and weekly intramuscular 17α-OHPC (250 mg) with no progesterone in 60 women at 20–24 weeks gestation and reported equal efficacy for both intramuscular and vaginal progesterone in the prevention of preterm labor.

Norman et al, in a large-scale study, compared 200 mg daily vaginal progesterone and placebo in the prevention of PTB and adverse neonatal outcomes. In contrast with the results of the above-mentioned studies, they reported that vaginal progesterone was not associated with reduced risk of PTB or neonatal complications.

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial by Areeruk and Phupong investigated the efficacy of oral dydrogesterone (20 mg daily) in the management of preterm labor in 48 pregnant women at 24th–34th gestational weeks. They found no significant difference between dydrogesterone and placebo groups in terms of uterine contractions, latency period, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, neonatal morbidity, and mortality. These results were completely compatible with our results regarding the comparison of outcomes between the dydrogesterone group and the controls, even though we used higher doses of dydrogesterone compared with that in Areeruk's study.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies with comparable sample size have investigated the efficacy of both 17α-OHPC and dydrogesterone in a controlled trial design to prevent PTB.

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^114JiEm2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

In our study, we compared the use of dydrogesterone (20 mg daily) associated with 90 mg daily of vaginal gel of progesterone with the use of 800 mg/die of vaginal micronized progesterone alone for the luteal phase supplementation in IVF patients. The primary endpoints evaluated were pregnancy, implantation, live birth, and miscarriage rates.

Use of an association of different progesterone products with different routes of administration relies on a few preliminary reports that seem to suggest an improvement in IVF outcomes. Patki et al. (2007) compared a combined regimen of micronized progesterone (600 mg/day) and oral dydrogesterone (20 mg/day) with 600 mg of vaginal micronized progesterone alone for luteal phase support in two groups of stimulated patients, in a GnRH agonist long protocol. They observed a higher clinical pregnancy rate in the combined medication group than in the single treatment group.

Other studies have compared the association of those different routes of administration of natural progesterone. Tomic et al. (2011) compared the results following the administration of 90 mg of progesterone vaginal gel applied daily in combination with 100 mg of oral micronized progesterone administered three times a day with the administration of 90 mg of progesterone vaginal gel applied daily, in a GnRH agonist long stimulation protocol. The combined group showed a higher ongoing pregnancy rate and lower miscarriage rate compared to the single-treatment group. Similar results were obtained by Devine et al. (2018) when comparing single administration of…

### Prempro [^114qGbVY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women.

- **Relative risk and absolute risk**: The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.

- **Cancer characteristics**: In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status, did not differ between the groups [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: A critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^116GwXBb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The PRISM trial subgroup by number of previous miscarriages examines the credibility of subgroup analyses. When should one believe a subgroup analysis? Subgroup analyses can suffer from false-positive results because of multiple comparisons or false-negative results from inadequate power. Therefore, robust guidelines have been developed to aid in the interpretation of subgroup analysis. These guidelines translate into 11 criteria: 5 on design, 2 on analysis, and 4 on the context. We applied these 11 criteria to the PRISM trial subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages to assess the credibility of the subgroup findings.

1. **Is the subgroup variable a characteristic measured at baseline?** Subgroups can be defined by features measured at baseline before randomization or by features emerging after randomization. Post-randomization features can be influenced by the intervention itself; thus, the validity of findings from subgroups that rely on post-randomization features can be compromised. For our subgroups, the number of miscarriages is known at baseline, before randomization, fulfilling this criterion.

2. **Is the effect suggested by comparisons within rather than between studies?** A subgroup effect observed only between studies, and not within a study, is unreliable as the subgroup effect may be due to the heterogeneity that is often present between various studies. A subgroup effect found within an individual study is more credible. The subgroup effect we identified was within the PRISM study itself, so this criterion is met.

3. **Was the hypothesis specified a priori?** The hypothesis was prespecified in advance, which aligns with established guidelines.

### Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding [^1148hmmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019).

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a menstrual blood loss perceived by women as excessive, affecting the health of women of reproductive age and interfering with their physical, emotional, social, and material quality of life. While abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynecological disease. The first-line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named "Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding" (1998).

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB.

- **Search methods**: In January 2019, we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. Citation lists of review articles were checked to identify trials.

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^117JREeB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

A normal luteal function is an essential factor for maintaining pregnancy; luteal phase deficiency decreases embryo implantation and pregnancy rate and increases the early miscarriage rate. In stimulated in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) patients, luteal phase support (LPS) is achieved through the exogenous supplementation with progesterone to increase endometrial receptivity and pregnancy. While several protocols exist, no commonly accepted protocol has been established for optimal luteal support after IVF-ET at the time of writing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two different luteal phase support protocols in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, open, randomized study conducted in a private IVF unit, a total of 700 infertile patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment were recruited for this study. All patients had a mild ovarian stimulation protocol with GnRH antagonist. The patients were randomized into two groups based on the type of luteal phase support route: Group A, control group (n = 310), received our routine LPS protocol, which consists of the administration of 800 mg of micronized vaginal progesterone; and Group B, study group (n = 310), received a combination of oral dydrogesterone 20 mg and 90 mg of a gel of vaginal micronized progesterone. Pregnancy rate, live birth rate, implantation rate, and miscarriage rate were evaluated as primary endpoints. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP software (version 17; SAS, Inc, Cary, NC, USA). A P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.

### Luteal phase support for assisted reproduction cycles [^115Myhi4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Progesterone prepares the endometrium for pregnancy by stimulating proliferation in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the corpus luteum. This occurs in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In assisted reproduction techniques (ART), progesterone and/or hCG levels are low, so the luteal phase is supported with progesterone, hCG, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to improve implantation and pregnancy rates.

- **Objectives**: To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of methods of luteal phase support provided to subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Search methods**: We searched databases including the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and trial registers. We conducted searches in November 2014, and further searches on 4 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of luteal phase support using progesterone, hCG, or GnRH agonist supplementation in ART cycles.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each comparison and combined data when appropriate using a fixed-effect model. Our primary outcome was live birth or ongoing pregnancy. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

- **Main results**: Ninety-four RCTs (26,198 women) were included. Most studies had unclear or high-quality evidence.

Prempro® (conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets) and Premphase® (conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets):

Read this patient information before you start taking Prempro or Premphase and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace consultation with your healthcare provider regarding your medical condition or treatment.

- **What is Prempro or Premphase?**
	- **Prempro or Premphase are medications containing two types of hormones**: estrogens and progestin.

- **What is Prempro or Premphase used for?**
	- **Prempro or Premphase is used post-menopause to**:
	- Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones produced by a woman's ovaries, which typically cease production when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This decline in estrogen levels results in menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). In certain cases, both ovaries may be surgically removed before natural menopause, leading to "surgical menopause". As estrogen levels decrease, some women experience symptoms such as warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). While some women experience mild symptoms and do not require estrogens, others experience more severe symptoms.
	- Treat menopausal changes in and around the vagina.

Please consult your healthcare provider for more comprehensive information and advice regarding the use of these medications.

### Intrauterine progestins, progesterone antagonists, and receptor modulators: A review of gynecologic applications [^114PV7eD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Intrauterine progestins, progesterone receptor modulators, and antagonists have many important and potential gynecologic applications. This article describes the evidence for the use of intrauterine progestin for common gynecologic conditions beyond its essential role in contraception. We review the evidence for intrauterine progestin delivery in the management of menorrhagia, endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, and its use in women on hormone replacement therapy or tamoxifen.

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^112ACQ1T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

A normal luteal function is an essential factor for maintaining pregnancy; luteal phase deficiency decreases embryo implantation and pregnancy rates and increases the early miscarriage rate. In stimulated in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) patients, luteal phase support (LPS) is achieved by the exogenous supplementation with progesterone to increase endometrial receptivity and pregnancy rates. While several protocols exist, no commonly accepted protocol has been established for optimal luteal support after IVF-ET at the time of writing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two different luteal phase support protocols in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies.

- **Methods**: In a prospective open, randomized study conducted in a private IVF unit, a total of 700 infertile patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment were recruited. All patients had a mild ovarian stimulation protocol with a GnRH antagonist. The patients were randomized into two groups based on the type of luteal phase support route: Group A, the control group (n = 310), received our routine LPS protocol, which consists of the administration of 800 mg of micronized vaginal progesterone. Group B, the study group (n = 310), received a combination of oral dydrogesterone 20 mg and 90 mg of a gel of vaginal micronized progesterone. Pregnancy rate, live birth rate, implantation rate, and miscarriage rate were evaluated as primary endpoints. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP software (version 17; SAS, Inc, Cary, NC, USA). A P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### What providers need to know about progestogens in hormone therapy [^116P3aWU]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Progestogens, such as micronized progesterone and synthetic progestins, are defined by their ability to transform the estrogen-primed proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. More than 200 progestogens have been synthesized, but only a few are used clinically in hormone therapy. Clinicians caring for menopausal women should be familiar with the clinical properties and characteristics of the three most-used progestogens for hormone therapy: micronized progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and norethindrone acetate.

### Comparison of oral dydrogesterone with progesterone gel and micronized progesterone for luteal support in 1,373 women undergoing in vitro fertilization: A randomized clinical study [^116UCTqJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of oral dydrogesterone with that of micronized vaginal progesterone gel and micronized progesterone capsule for luteal supplementation in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This was a prospective, randomized clinical study conducted at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Kolkata, India. The study involved a total of 1,373 infertile women undergoing IVF. The interventions included administration of micronized progesterone gel, progesterone capsule, and oral dydrogesterone for luteal support.

- **Main outcome measures**: Demographic profile, pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates.

The results indicated that the overall pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate were comparable among the three groups. The conclusion suggests that oral dydrogesterone appears to be a promising drug for luteal support in women undergoing IVF.

### Prempro [^114FqHaJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77–3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.

A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with the use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27–1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.

### Evaluation of clinical meaningfulness of estrogen plus progesterone oral capsule (TX-001HR) on moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms [^115R5mDV]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

After the publication of the Women's Health Initiative findings in 2002, many women discontinued FDA-approved hormone therapy (HT), with many starting to use non-FDA-approved compounded hormone therapy (CHT). Recent annual estimates of CHT use have shown that 1 to 2.5 million women filled 21 to 39 million prescriptions in the United States. CHT products have not been rigorously tested for efficacy and safety. Although many women prefer taking "natural" products, believing they are safer options than FDA-approved HT products, they may be unaware of risks associated with CHT. These risks include insufficient endometrial protection, which can result in endometrial cancer or hyperplasia.

- **PRO data and benefits**: The PRO data reported here show that women taking TX-001HR have clinically meaningful responses to treatment. This information might help women and healthcare providers better understand the benefits of FDA-approved products. If approved, the formulation of TX-001HR combining E2/P4, which has been rigorously evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled REPLENISH trial, may become a new option for women taking poorly regulated CHT.

Some of the limitations of the study include a short duration of treatment, studying women who are healthier than the general population, and evaluating only women residing in the United States. Strengths of the study include that it was a well-designed, double-blind, randomized controlled trial planned with the guidance of the FDA. The study design, health of the population, and discontinuation rates are similar to other studies that have evaluated menopausal drugs.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^114EvEyq]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Spark et al. surveyed 366 Australian women who were taking compounded progesterone and found that 89% started using compounded progesterone because they viewed it as natural. Women's desire for EPT formulations that contain bioidentical hormones, coupled with the need for a formulation that has proven safety and efficacy, was the impetus behind the development of TX-001HR. The active ingredients in TX-001HR are chemically and biologically identical to endogenous estradiol and progesterone. If approved, the non–peanut oil–containing TX-001HR would be the first FDA-approved EPT option for postmenopausal women with nut allergy who prefer oral progesterone to progestins. It would be a safer alternative to unregulated compounded EPT for symptomatic postmenopausal women with intact uterus who prefer an oral HT regimen that combines estradiol with progesterone.

Healthy postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 years) with intact uterus (N = 1,750) are being recruited for the phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled REPLENISH trial (NCT01942668), which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TX-001HR. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of several doses of this novel estradiol/progesterone combination or to placebo for 1 year. The primary endpoint is the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at 12 months in the overall population and the improvement in climactic symptoms at 12 weeks in a subset of women experiencing more severe vasomotor symptoms. To our knowledge, REPLENISH is the first phase 3 randomized controlled trial of an oral estradiol-progesterone combination.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^113PdyLb]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to combine the natural hormones 17β-estradiol (estradiol) and progesterone in a single-dose form to treat menopause symptoms while providing endometrial protection would be clinically useful. A comprehensive search suggests that no single drug combining these two hormones has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A product that combines 17β-estradiol with progesterone and offers good bioavailability of both hormones is difficult to achieve biochemically. Progesterone has poor bioavailability — it is highly lipophilic and undergoes a complex metabolic process, making it difficult to administer orally or transdermally. Administering clinically effective oral doses of estradiol and progesterone together in a formulation that does not compromise the bioavailability of either hormone is challenging because of differences in their structure and solubility.

Many compounding pharmacies manufacture products that combine estrogen and progesterone. Considering the poor bioavailability of oral and transdermal progesterone and the difficulty in determining the appropriate ratio of progesterone to estradiol, compounded hormone products should be viewed with caution. Pharmacokinetic studies of products manufactured by compounding pharmacies (with the aim to ensure adequate bioavailability) are rarely performed, and few clinical trials have appropriately evaluated the safety and efficacy of compounded hormones. For example, despite the widespread use of custom-compounded progesterone gels and creams, there is no evidence to show that any of them opposes estradiol.

### Progestogens used in postmenopausal hormone therapy: Differences in their pharmacological properties, intracellular actions, and clinical effects [^113tAusb]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The safety of progestogens as a class has come under increased scrutiny after the publication of data from the Women's Health Initiative trial, particularly with respect to breast cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Despite the fact that only one progestogen, medroxyprogesterone acetate, was used in this study, inconsistency in nomenclature has caused confusion between synthetic progestogens, defined here by the term progestin, and natural progesterone.

Although all progestogens by definition have progestational activity, they also have a divergent range of other properties that can translate to very different clinical effects. Endometrial protection is the primary reason for prescribing a progestogen concomitantly with postmenopausal estrogen therapy in women with a uterus, but several progestogens are known to have a range of other potentially beneficial effects, for example on the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

Because women remain suspicious of the progestogen component of postmenopausal hormone therapy in light of the Women's Health Initiative trial, practitioners should not ignore the potential benefits to their patients of some progestogens by considering them to be a single pharmacological class. There is a lack of understanding of the differences between progestins and progesterone, and between individual progestins differing in their effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems, the breast, and bone. This review elucidates the differences between the substantial number of individual progestogens employed in postmenopausal hormone therapy.

### Development, updates, and future directions of the World Health Organization selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use [^1142EGaw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). High credibility.

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR. Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as "Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct, and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?", "How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogesterone acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?", and "What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectables?".

### Vaginal micronized progesterone versus the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for treatment of non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia: A randomized controlled trial [^111wp1ZX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

To compare the efficiency of vaginal micronized progesterone (VMP) with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in patients with non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia, a validated Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) was used to assess the quality of life before and after the procedure.

- **Methods**: In this prospective trial, 144 women were randomly assigned to the VMP or LNG-IUS group. The primary endpoint was the regression rate of endometrial hyperplasia after 3 months of treatment. The protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03992937).

- **Results**: In all, 138 patients were analyzed. The regression rate was not significantly different between the groups (95.8% with LNG-IUS vs. 90.8% with VMP; P = 0.194). Differences between pre- and post-treatment MIQ scores were similar, except that better scores were obtained in the VMP group for the perception of the amount of blood loss (P = 0.035).

- **Conclusion**: VMP is as effective as the LNG-IUS as a local treatment of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^111FULv1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Turner syndrome, specifically concerning female sex hormones (progesterone), the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend adding cyclic progesterone once breakthrough bleeding occurs. This typically happens after about 18–24 months of unopposed estrogen exposure, although it can occur later based on factors such as pubertal stage, serum estradiol levels, uterine growth, endometrial thickness, and estrogen dose. Micronized progesterone 200 mg is preferred for 10–12 days per month.

### Progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for heavy menstrual bleeding [^114mf7Bg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a significant cause of ill health in women, accounting for 12% of all gynecology referrals in the UK. HMB is clinically defined as greater than or equal to 80 mL of blood loss per menstrual cycle. However, women may report excessive bleeding even when their blood loss is less than 80 ml. While hysterectomy is often used to treat this complaint, medical therapy may be a successful alternative. The intrauterine coil device, originally developed as a contraceptive, saw a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss with the addition of uterine relaxing hormones, such as progestogens. Case studies of progesterone or progestogen-releasing systems like Progestasert and Mirena reported reductions of up to 90% in menstrual bleeding and improvement in dysmenorrhea. However, some women may view insertion as invasive, which can affect its acceptability as a treatment. Moreover, frequent intermenstrual bleeding and spotting are common during the first few months.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.

- **Search strategy**: All studies potentially describing randomized controlled trials of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices for treating heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained via electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), and EMBASE (1980 to 2005). Companies producing progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices were also consulted.

### Management of premenstrual syndrome: Green-top guideline No. 48 [^112KPyr2]. BJOG (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for premenstrual syndrome, more specifically with respect to estrogen patches and implants, RCOG 2017 guidelines suggest offering micronized progesterone as the first-line progestogenic opposition rather than progestogens, as micronized progesterone is theoretically less likely to reintroduce PMS-like symptoms.

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^114DpxjG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Our study shows no statistical differences observed between the combined route group and single route group in terms of clinical outcomes, and the combination of oral dydrogesterone and vaginal micronized progesterone seems to be non-superior to vaginal progesterone alone, at least in mild stimulation settings. Further randomized studies, taking into account the different protocols of ovarian stimulation, are needed to understand whether vaginal micronized progesterone alone has the same or greater efficacy than the association of vaginal micronized progesterone with oral dydrogesterone for luteal phase support. Indeed, searching for optimal luteal phase support still requires further investigation.

### Postmenopausal estrogen for treatment of hot flashes: Clinical applications [^1165Pbn9]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Use of postmenopausal estrogen has evolved since the first results from the Women's Health Initiative in 2002. Professional organizations, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the US Preventive Services Task Force have issued new recommendations against the use of estrogen and progestin or progesterone for the prevention of chronic conditions. This article examines the state of evidence for postmenopausal estrogen use to inform management decisions in two clinical scenarios: initiating therapy in a perimenopausal woman with hot flashes and discontinuing estrogen use in a long-term user.

### Uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy complicated by threatened abortion supplemented with vaginal micronized progesterone or oral dydrogesterone [^113s5Hyv]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare the influence of vaginal micronized progesterone and oral dydrogesterone supplementation on uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy complicated by threatened abortion.

The study design was a randomized, parallel group, double-blind, double dummy-controlled study conducted at a tertiary care university hospital. The patient cohort consisted of fifty-three individuals with threatened abortion and a living embryo.

Interventions included the administration of 300 milligrams of micronized vaginal progesterone or 30 mg of oral dydrogesterone daily for 6 weeks. This was accompanied by serial transvaginal Doppler ultrasound measurements of the pulsatility index, resistance index, and systolic/diastolic ratio of the spiral arteries, uterine arteries, and intrachorionic area.

- **Main outcome measures**: Uteroplacental blood flow.

- **Results**: The study demonstrated that vaginal progesterone administration, but not oral dydrogesterone treatment, led to a decrease in the spiral artery pulsatility and resistance index and the systolic/diastolic ratio. An insignificant decrease in the pulsatility index and resistance index of the uterine artery was observed at > 9 weeks and was not associated with the treatment regimen. Dydrogesterone treatment was only accompanied by a decrease in the uterine artery systolic/diastolic ratio.

- **Conclusion**: Vaginal progesterone and oral dydrogesterone supplementation have different influences on the uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy complicated by threatened abortion.

### Crinone [^115UujVD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Crinone® (progesterone gel) is a bioadhesive vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system, which is contained in single-use, polypropylene vaginal applicators. The carrier vehicle is an oil-in-water emulsion with the water-swellable but insoluble polymer, polycarbophil. The progesterone is partially soluble in both the oil and water phases of the vehicle, with the majority existing as a suspension. Physically, Crinone appears as a soft, white to off-white gel.

The active ingredient, progesterone, is present in either a 4% or an 8% concentration (w/w). The chemical name for progesterone is pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. It has an empirical formula of C21H30O2 and a molecular weight of 314.5.

Progesterone exists in two polymorphic forms. Form 1, which is used in Crinone, appears as white orthorhombic prisms with a melting point of 127–131°C.

Each applicator delivers 1.125 grams of Crinone gel containing either 45 mg (4% gel) or 90 mg (8% gel) of progesterone in a base containing glycerin, light mineral oil, polycarbophil, carbomer homopolymer Type B, hydrogenated palm oil glyceride, sorbic acid, purified water, and may contain sodium hydroxide.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: A critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^114EhXYn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the interpretation of subgroup effects note that "debates about subgroup effects may be framed in terms of absolute acceptance or rejection", but such "yes versus no polarized approach is undesirable and destructive, mainly because it ignores the uncertainty that is inevitably part of such judgments". Furthermore, "an approach that is more productive and more realistic is to place the likelihood that a subgroup effect is real on a continuum from 'highly plausible' to 'extremely unlikely'… the question is then a decision of where on this continuum a putative subgroup effect lies". We propose the subgroup effect first suggested in the PROMISE trial, and then confirmed in the PRISM trial, is highly plausible.

### Estropipate [^113rfAKj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

When estrogen is prescribed for a woman with a uterus, progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

Patients should be reevaluated periodically, such as at 3-month to 6-month intervals, to determine if treatment is still necessary. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS).

### Progesterone [^112zDhVs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Please read this information carefully before you start to use Progesterone Injection and each time your prescription is renewed, in case anything has changed. This leaflet does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. If you still have any questions, ask your doctor or health-care provider.

Progesterone Injection is a sterile injectable solution containing the natural female hormone called progesterone. It is indicated for the treatment of amenorrhea (absence of menses in women who have previously had a menstrual period) and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance.

Understanding the role of Progesterone Injection in the treatment of your menstrual irregularities is important. Progesterone is one of the hormones essential for regular menstrual periods. If your doctor has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own, Progesterone Injection may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need. When you do not produce enough progesterone, menstrual irregularities can occur. Progesterone Injection can provide you with the progesterone needed during a normal menstrual cycle.

- **Possible side effects of Progesterone Injection**: The following side effects have been reported with Progesterone Injection. Consult your doctor if you experience any of the side effects mentioned below, or other side effects.

	- If you experience sleepiness, do not drive or operate machinery.

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^112Bwetc]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Authors of a systematic literature search for RCTs evaluating compounded progesterone cream for vasomotor symptoms found three RCTs, none of which applied the FDA methodology for assessing endometrial safety. A few observational studies and surveys offered low-level evidence that CBHT improved menopausal symptoms, but most consolidated results for all CBHT used, ignoring differences in hormones, doses, and delivery methods.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^115fY4AG]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Although some individuals have a legitimate need for compounded hormone therapy (HT), the use of compounded HT greatly exceeds the scope of need. Determining the full extent to which these unregulated, largely untested compounded HT combinations are being used in the United States is difficult because sales are not tracked and some may be obtained without a prescription. However, compounded hormones are believed to make up a large and growing share of estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for menopausal symptoms, suggesting an unmet need.

An investigational oral drug that combines 2 mg of solubilized 17β-estradiol with 200 mg of progesterone in a gelatin capsule (TX-001HR; TherapeuticsMD Inc, Boca Raton, FL) has been developed. The estradiol and progesterone ingredients used in the combination are plant-derived and chemically identical to human hormones of ovarian origin. Consistent with FDA guidelines that call for comparing the bioequivalence of any new product with the market standard, a randomized, open-label, three-period, three-sequence, two-treatment, partial-replicate, crossover study was conducted to characterize the drug's pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in healthy postmenopausal women. The objective was to show that the bioavailability of the estradiol and progesterone compounds used in TX-001HR was equivalent to the bioavailability of the same doses of commercially available, separate formulations of oral estradiol and progesterone coadministered under fed conditions.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^115LcN9D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Type of progestogen used in the PROMISE and PRISM trials**: We used vaginal, micronized progesterone in the PROMISE and PRISM trials. The results from these trials are not necessarily generalizable to progestogens such as dydrogesterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The natural progesterone used in these trials is derived from soybeans and Mexican yam roots and has an identical chemical structure to physiological progesterone synthesized in the human body. Synthetic progestogens, which include dydrogesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, have a different molecular structure, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, as well as a different safety profile. We have restricted our analysis to progesterone, and our data do not support or refute the role of other progesterone-like compounds.

- **Implications for clinical practice**: In summary, the PRISM and PROMISE trials found a small but positive treatment effect that seems to be dependent on the number of miscarriages. Our analysis did not suggest any benefit from progesterone therapy for women with early pregnancy bleeding but no history of miscarriages. We believe that the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages identify high-risk women in whom progesterone is of benefit. The question is how this should affect clinical practice. We recommend that the information should be communicated to women at high risk of miscarriages to enable shared decision-making. Our suggestion is to consider offering progesterone to women with vaginal bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages.

Despite several international obstetrics/gynecology societies issuing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing symptomatic uterine fibroids, these guidelines often do not reflect the most recent clinical evidence and approved indications for a key medical management option: the selective progesterone receptor modulator class. This article aims to share the clinical experience gained with selective progesterone receptor modulators in Europe and Canada by reviewing their historical development, best practices for their use based on available data, and potential future uses for selective progesterone receptor modulators in uterine fibroids and other gynecologic conditions.

### Oral dydrogesterone along with vaginal micronized progesterone supplementation for luteal phase support in IVF patients, and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates: a prospective randomized trial [^115KKC1E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Progesterone administration has been implemented through different routes: intramuscularly (IM), subcutaneously, vaginally, rectally, or orally, with controversial results. Intramuscular administration of natural progesterone has been considered the best choice for luteal phase support in IVF-ET cycles. Recently, the vaginal administration of micronized natural progesterone has gained popularity in assisted reproductive technology (ART) as it alleviates the side effects and low compliance associated with intramuscular progesterone. A recent meta-analysis revealed no differences between vaginal and intramuscular routes of progesterone administration in terms of efficacy and pregnancy outcomes. However, other studies reported that the incidence of side effects associated with intramuscular progesterone seems to be higher than with vaginal progesterone.

Another natural progesterone formulation, which can be administered subcutaneously, has recently become available for luteal phase support. The results obtained have shown no statistical differences compared with the intramuscular route in terms of live birth rate. Recently, there has been interest in the oral route of progesterone administration in ART, given that dydrogesterone (DG) has long been used to treat other conditions associated with progesterone deficiency. Dydrogesterone is a 6-dihydro-retroprogesterone characterized by high oral bioavailability, good tolerability, easy absorption, and higher selectivity for progesterone receptors. Its oral route of administration is considered to be effective for luteal phase support in IVF.

### Improvement in sleep outcomes with a 17β-estradiol-progesterone oral capsule (TX-001HR) for postmenopausal women [^114Eypod]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Somnolence is a concern with P4 therapy and has been reported in approximately 2.7% of women taking a different formulation of micronized P4 (Prometrium, dose and regimen not specified), with the highest incidence in women aged 50 to 59 years. In the REPLENISH trial, when P4 was given continuously (50 mg or 100 mg), the incidence of somnolence was, however, low and not clinically different from placebo. Moreover, we observed that TX-001HR did not negatively impact the MOS-Sleep somnolence subscale.

Allopregnanolone, a metabolite of P4, has been shown to induce GABAergic effects and promote sleep. A small, 3-week study showed that 300 mg of P4 given orally at bedtime to healthy postmenopausal women had no effect on undisturbed sleep but restored normal sleep when sleep was disturbed, with no effect on sleep architecture. Another small study in postmenopausal women showed that 300 mg P4 alone for 21 days significantly increased rapid eye movement sleep in the first third of the night and reduced time spent awake compared with placebo.

### Progesterone [^114kecNu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Progesterone is administered by intramuscular injection. It differs from other commonly used steroids in that it is irritating at the place of injection.

- **Amenorrhea**: Five to 10 mg are given for six to eight consecutive days. If there has been sufficient ovarian activity to produce a proliferative endometrium, one can expect withdrawal bleeding forty-eight to seventy-two hours after the last injection. This may be followed by spontaneous normal cycles.

- **Functional uterine bleeding**: Five to 10 mg are given daily for six doses. Bleeding may be expected to cease within six days. When estrogen is given as well, the administration of progesterone is begun after two weeks of estrogen therapy. If menstrual flow begins during the course of injections of progesterone, they are discontinued.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^1164ZMnN]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

- **Participant disposition and baseline characteristics**: Healthy postmenopausal women (N = 66) were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment sequences described in the "Methods". The women had a mean (SD) age of 49.5 (5.6) years, with a range from 40 to 64 years, and a mean (SD) body mass index of 24.8 (3.1) kg/m², ranging from 18.7 to 29.9 kg/m². The mean (SD) height was 150.6 (5.4) cm, with a range from 138.0 to 162.0 cm, and the mean (SD) weight was 56.1 (7.0) kg, ranging from 42.0 to 75.0 kg.

Overall, 94% of participants (62 of 66) completed all three study periods. Four women did not report to the facility for period II and/or period III. Analyses for total estrone were conducted using data for 61 participants. Data for one woman who had a predose estrone level higher than 5% of C max were excluded in keeping with FDA guidance for bioequivalence studies.

### SPL drug information for progesterone [^114ACEmH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of progesterone PO (also known as Prometrium, Crinone):

- **Stroke, clinically evident coronary heart disease, ovarian cancer, visual disorder, diplopia, migraine**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as progesterone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse effects.

- **VTE**: Use extreme caution in patients with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Consider discontinuing the drug at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: A randomized controlled trial [^113vipX6]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Participants

Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously. In brief, healthy postmenopausal women aged 40–65 years, with an intact uterus and a body mass index of ≤ 34.0 kg/m², seeking VMS treatment, were eligible. Postmenopausal status was defined as one of the following conditions:

- **≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea**
- **≥ 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with > 40 mIU/mL screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone level**
- **≥ 6 weeks after bilateral oophorectomy**:

Eligible women had to have a normal or nonclinically significant breast examination and a normal mammogram (BI-RADS 1 or 2) performed at screening or within 6 months before the first dose. Women with a BI-RADS 0 (incomplete) screening mammogram were excluded. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were typical for HT assessment studies, as described elsewhere. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Prempro [^115gFNsg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prempro® (conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets) and Premphase® (conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets) are medicines containing two kinds of hormones: estrogens and a progestin. Please read this patient information before starting Prempro or Premphase and each time you refill your prescription, as there may be new information. This information does not replace the advice from your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

- **Purpose and usage**:
	- **Prempro or Premphase is utilized after menopause to**:
	- **Reduce moderate to severe hot flushes**:
		Estrogens are hormones produced by a woman's ovaries. Typically, the ovaries cease estrogen production when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This decline in estrogen levels results in menopause, also known as the "change of life" (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are surgically removed before natural menopause occurs, causing a sudden drop in estrogen levels and leading to "surgical menopause".

		As estrogen levels decrease, some women experience uncomfortable symptoms such as warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense heat and sweating ("hot flushes"). While some women have mild symptoms and may not need estrogen therapy, others experience more severe symptoms which necessitate treatment.

	- **Treat menopausal changes in and around the vagina**:
		The medication is also used to alleviate menopausal changes affecting the vaginal area. Please consult with your healthcare provider for more information.

Remember, consult with your healthcare provider for individualized advice and information pertaining to your specific health needs.

### Progestogens for preventing miscarriage: a network meta-analysis [^116nxPqt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation, is common. Approximately 25% of women experience a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Progesterone plays an important role in maintaining a pregnancy. Supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage) and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened miscarriage and recurrent miscarriage. The goal is to provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side-effect profile.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), as well as the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster-randomized trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomized trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi- and non-randomized trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted relevant data.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: A critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^1122QG1N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Further research is required to enhance our understanding of luteal phase deficiencies (LPD) and to develop and validate tests to identify women with LPD-related pregnancy losses. The increased effectiveness of progesterone with an increasing number of miscarriages indicates that endometrial defects are a major driver of higher-order miscarriages. Yet, even after multiple miscarriages, the live birth rate and cumulative live birth rate in these patients remain high. Presumably, this means that the underlying endometrial defect is intermittent rather than persistent and that its frequency (i.e. the number of "normal" vs. "abnormal" cycles) determines the likelihood of miscarriage. This disease model is compatible with emerging biology, demonstrating that the tissue homeostasis in the cycling endometrium is dependent on the recruitment of bone marrow–derived stem cells and uterine natural killer cells. Both "homeostatic" mechanisms are perturbed in repeated miscarriages. A "dynamic" disease model may help to explain the failure of diagnostic approaches, such as screening for luteal-phase defects.

Currently, we rely on clinical history to profile patients who may have a high risk of progesterone-related problems. However, this method is imprecise. Accurate endometrial tests may allow for more precise targeting of patients who may benefit from progesterone treatment. Karyotyping all pregnancy losses may also help to better risk-stratify women who could benefit from progesterone therapy. The role of routine karyotyping using modern genetic analysis needs further research, including health economic evaluations.

### Recurrent miscarriage green-top guideline No. 17 [^113NtSSQ]. BJOG (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to the management of vaginal bleeding, the RCOG 2023 guidelines suggest offering progestogen supplementation. This involves administering 400 mg of micronized vaginal progesterone twice daily (BID) at the time of bleeding, continuing until 16 weeks of gestation, in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss presenting with bleeding in early pregnancy.

### Crinone [^117VwNRA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue, and its effect on the differentiation of glandular epithelia and stroma has been extensively studied. It is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy. Normal or near-normal endometrial responses to oral estradiol and intramuscular progesterone have been noted in functionally agonadal women through the sixth decade of life. Additionally, progesterone administration decreases the circulatory levels of gonadotropins.

### Efficacy of progestin-only treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms: a systematic review [^116Uevcw]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with bothersome symptoms for many women, including mood changes, hot flushes, sleep problems, and fatigue. Progesterone is commonly prescribed in combination with estrogen therapy. Although monotherapy with progestins has been used as treatment for menopausal symptoms in women with contraindications to estrogens, the optimal route and dosage of progestin monotherapy has not been established.

- **Objective**: To assess whether progestin as a standalone treatment is effective for treating vasomotor and mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Evidence review**: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Embase databases from January 1980 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated different forms of progestin for the treatment of vasomotor or mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Findings**: A systematic search of 892 studies identified seven RCTs involving a total of 601 patients. The available literature was heterogeneous in terms of formulation and dose of progesterone; administration ranged from 5 to 60 mg of transdermal progesterone, 10 to 20 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone. Duration of treatment also differed between studies, ranging from 21 days to 12 months (median: 12 weeks). Three of seven RCTs reported that progestin therapy led to an improvement of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women. The largest study administering oral progestin using 300 mg micronized progesterone reported a 58.9% improvement in VMS compared to 23.5% in the placebo group.

### Progesterone and preterm birth [^111S3w19]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

The most recent Cochrane review on progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth, published in 2013, examined the evidence on the use of any progestogen for women at risk of preterm birth either because of a previous preterm birth or due to a short cervix. Although the two risk categories were examined separately, all progestogens were considered collectively.

- **Efficacy of progesterone for preterm birth prevention**: For women with a previous preterm birth, the review suggested that progestogens reduce the risk of preterm birth before 34 gestational weeks [relative risk (RR), 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14–0.69], reduce perinatal mortality (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33–0.75), decrease the incidence of low birthweight (< 2500 g; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.79), and reduce neonatal death (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27–0.76). The sample size for the data on perinatal or neonatal death was 1453, whereas that for preterm birth before 34 weeks was 602.

- **For women with cervical shortening**: The review found that, among the above outcomes, only preterm birth before 34 weeks was significantly reduced by progestogen (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.90). Although there was a trend toward a reduction in perinatal mortality, low birthweight under 2500 g, and neonatal death, none of these effects was statistically significant [RR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.42–1.29), 0.92 (0.78–1.09), and 0.55 (0.26–1.13), respectively].

Further analyses in the review found no differential effects in terms of the route of administration, time of commencement of therapy, or dose of progesterone for the majority of outcomes examined.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: A critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^113y68tn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The role of first-trimester progesterone supplementation in the treatment of pregnancies at high risk of miscarriage is a long-standing research question that has been debated in the medical literature for more than 60 years. The PROMISE and PRISM trials are two very high-quality trials that have addressed the effects of first-trimester use of vaginal micronized progesterone treatment in women at risk of a miscarriage.

- **Biologic plausibility**: Approximately one half of all miscarriages, including pregnancy losses in women with recurrent miscarriage, are due to numeric chromosome errors with trisomy being the most frequent, especially with advancing maternal age, followed by polyploidy and monosomy X. Such "aneuploid" miscarriages are thought to occur on a random basis, meaning that the risk of subsequent miscarriage is not increased. "Euploid" miscarriages, in contrast, are more frequently diagnosed with an increasing number of previous miscarriages, as shown in Figure 5.

- **Luteal phase defect (LPD)**: A progesterone-related problem, often given the name "luteal phase defect" (LPD), is considered to be one of the causes of a euploid miscarriage. The corpus luteum in the ovary produces progesterone during early pregnancy. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the decidua, and it is hypothesized that a defect in the function of the corpus luteum can result in low progesterone levels, which in turn may increase the risk of miscarriage. However, there is no clear definition for LPD, and there are certainly no reliable tests to identify patients who may have the condition.

### Vaginal progesterone for pregnancy prolongation after arrested preterm labor: A randomized clinical trial [^114qW5hs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study, "Vaginal Progesterone in Arrested Preterm Labor", was published by Zohar Nachum and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study addresses the diseases of preterm labor and postpartum hemorrhage. The trial question was: what is the role of vaginal micronized progesterone in women with arrested preterm labor? The study design was a multi-center, open label, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The population included 129 female patients. Inclusion criteria were women with singleton and twin pregnancies after arrested preterm labor following tocolysis at 24–34 weeks of gestation. Key exclusion criteria included a history of preterm delivery, asymptomatic cervical shortening during pregnancy, suspected chorioamnionitis, significant placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death, major fetal malformations, allergy to progesterone, and use of progesterone.

- **Interventions**:
	- **N = 65**: Vaginal micronized progesterone (200 mg suppository BID until 36 weeks and 6 days of gestation)
	- **N = 64**: Usual care (no treatment)

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in mean pregnancy prolongation until 37 weeks (40 days vs. 37.4 days; AD 2.6 days, 95% CI -3.88 to 9.08).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant d

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^114hnZK8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug appears to be devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses.
