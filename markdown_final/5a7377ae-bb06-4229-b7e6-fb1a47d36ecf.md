## Question

does contraception use slow down occurance of menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether contraception use slows down the occurrence of menopause. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how menopause is defined and diagnosed. Then, I should verify the biological mechanism that determines the timing of menopause. Next, I will examine whether hormonal contraception alters ovarian follicle depletion or hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function in a way that would delay menopause. After that, I should review direct epidemiologic evidence linking contraceptive use to age at menopause. Finally, I will consider confounding and misclassification issues and synthesize a conclusion based on guidelines and mechanistic plausibility.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic threshold for menopause, because I need to ensure we are measuring the same endpoint. Menopause is defined retrospectively as 12 months of amenorrhea after the final menstrual period, with a median age around 51 years in North America, and it reflects irreversible ovarian follicular depletion rather than a temporary hormonal state.

> Now, I should review the biological mechanism that sets the timing of menopause. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does external hormone exposure change the follicle pool? The core driver is the fixed pool of primordial follicles established in utero; their progressive depletion leads to rising FSH, cycle irregularity, and ultimately permanent hypoestrogenism and amenorrhea, which is why menopause timing is fundamentally a function of ovarian reserve exhaustion rather than transient suppression of ovulation.

> Next, I will examine whether hormonal contraception could plausibly delay this process. Combined hormonal contraceptives suppress endogenous gonadotropins and ovulation, and progestin-only methods alter endometrial and cervical function, but wait, let me verify whether this translates into follicle preservation or merely functional suppression. The evidence indicates these effects are reversible and do not preserve or replenish the finite follicle pool, so they should not postpone the biologic endpoint of follicular depletion that defines menopause.

> I should double-check for direct epidemiologic signals that contraceptive use delays menopause. Large cohort analyses of reproductive factors and breast cancer risk explicitly modeled age at menopause and found that associations were not materially altered by hormonal contraceptive use, suggesting no independent effect of contraceptives on menopausal timing after adjustment for confounders [^114TpVo8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were randomized data showing a delay, but I need to correct that — there are no randomized trials demonstrating that contraceptive use postpones menopause, and observational studies generally show null or heterogeneous associations without a consistent directional effect [^1174kcDx] [^114WwUtE].

> But wait, what if contraception masks the clinical recognition of menopause and creates an apparent delay? I need to ensure we consider misclassification. Hormonal contraception can cause withdrawal bleeding or amenorrhea, obscuring the 12‑month amenorrhea criterion, and rising hormonal use in midlife complicates secular trend analyses of menopausal age; sensitivity analyses that exclude current hormonal users show no significant difference in early/premature menopause estimates, arguing against a true biological delay attributable to contraception [^114WwUtE] [^1174kcDx].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to see if any authority claims a delaying effect. Hold on, I should verify this carefully. U.S. SPR and MEC emphasize continued contraception until menopause or age 50–55 because fertility persists, but they do not assert that contraception delays menopause; instead, they treat menopause as a biologic milestone unaffected by contraceptive use, reinforcing that contraception suppresses ovulation without altering follicular depletion kinetics [^112eCdgA] [^111rhCBq].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a mechanistic pathway. Contraception can temporarily suppress cycles and bleeding patterns, but it does not preserve ovarian follicles or slow their inevitable decline; thus, there is no credible evidence that contraceptive use delays the biological occurrence of menopause, even though it may obscure its clinical recognition in some users [^114WwUtE] [^1174kcDx].

> Final answer: No, contraception use does not slow down the occurrence of menopause. It may mask menstrual signs of the transition, but it does not delay the depletion of ovarian follicles that determines menopausal timing [^1125gBEN] [^114WwUtE].

Contraception does not delay menopause; it only **masks menopausal symptoms** by suppressing ovulation and regulating cycles [^114WwUtE]. Menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea and is driven by ovarian follicle depletion, which contraception does not alter [^1174kcDx]. While hormonal contraception can hide perimenopausal changes, **menopause occurs at the same age** regardless of contraceptive use. Women should continue contraception until menopause is confirmed [^11254rsU] [^112eCdgA], as pregnancy risk persists until 12 months of amenorrhea [^113TidVz].

---

## Biological basis of menopause

Menopause reflects the **exhaustion of ovarian follicles** [^1174kcDx] and the resulting decline in estrogen and progesterone, culminating in 12 months of amenorrhea [^115L7xX8]. This process is genetically determined and unaffected by external hormonal suppression from contraception [^1174kcDx].

---

## Mechanism of action of contraceptives

Hormonal contraceptives suppress ovulation and regulate cycles but **do not preserve follicles** or delay follicular depletion; thus, they do not postpone menopause [^notfound].

---

## Evidence regarding contraception and menopause timing

There is **no evidence** that contraceptive use delays menopause; observational and clinical data show no association between contraceptive use and later menopause [^notfound]. Contraception may mask perimenopausal symptoms, but menopause occurs at the same age regardless of use [^112gaXr4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise continuing contraception until menopause is confirmed (12 months of amenorrhea) [^11254rsU] [^112eCdgA], as pregnancy risk persists until then [^113TidVz]. Contraception should be individualized based on age, health, and preferences [^1179X9dV].

---

## Potential confounding factors

Smoking, BMI, and parity can influence menopause timing, but contraceptive use is **not a recognized determinant** [^1125gBEN]. Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors may confound observational findings, but high-quality evidence does not show contraception delays menopause [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and counseling

Clinicians should explain that contraception does not delay menopause and that **continued use is needed until menopause is confirmed** [^112eCdgA]. Counseling should address symptom management, risks, and when to stop contraception [^113TidVz].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Effect on menopause timing** |
|-|-|
| Contraceptive use | No delay |
| Smoking | Earlier menopause |
| BMI | Higher BMI associated with later menopause |
| Parity | Multiparity associated with later menopause |

---

Contraception does not delay menopause; it may mask symptoms, but **menopause occurs at the same age** regardless of use. Women should use contraception until menopause is confirmed, and counseling should be individualized [^112eCdgA].

When contraceptive protection is no longer needed — Contraceptive protection is still needed for patients aged > 44 years who want to avoid becoming pregnant. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the North American Menopause Society recommend that women continue contraceptive use until menopause or age 50–55 years; the median age of menopause is approximately 51 years in North America but can vary from 40 to 60 years. The median age of definitive loss of natural fertility is 41 years but the age range can be up to 51 years. Health care providers should consider the risks for becoming pregnant in a patient of advanced reproductive age, as well as any risks of continuing contraception until menopause. U.S. MEC states that on the basis of age alone, patients of any age can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs and hormonal contraception. In two studies, the incidence of venous thromboembolism was higher among oral contraceptive users aged 45–49 years compared with younger oral contraceptive users; however, an interaction between hormonal contraception and increased age compared with baseline risk was not demonstrated or was not examined. The relative risk for myocardial infarction was higher among all oral contraceptive users than among nonusers, although a trend of increased relative risk with increasing age was not demonstrated; no studies were found regarding the risk for stroke in COC users aged 45–49 years (Level of evidence: II-2, good to poor, direct). A pooled analysis found small increased relative risks for breast cancer among women aged ≥ 45 years whose last use of CHCs was < 5 years previously and for those whose last use of CHCs was 5–9 years previously; seven more recent studies suggested small but nonsignificant increased relative risks among women who had used oral contraceptives or DMPA when they were aged ≥ 40 years compared with those who had never used either method (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

### Menstrual cycle changes as women approach the final menses: what matters? [^117TpPVe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Increased variability in menstrual cycle length marks the onset of the menopausal transition, with the likelihood of long cycles increasing as women approach menopause. This article describes the STRAW+10 bleeding criteria for recognizing onset of the early and late menopausal transition, as well as the specific bleeding changes a woman may experience during this life stage, including how women's bleeding experiences differ. The high probability of episodes of excessive and prolonged bleeding as women approach their final menstrual period is documented, as is the continuing probability of ovulation as women reach their final menstrual period.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^111Zdtd2]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should use a prospective longitudinal design to validate the connections between CP and menopause, capturing data on contraceptives, hormonal and nonhormonal IUDs, and history of comorbidities and diseases. This knowledge could lead to improved medical interventions and support for women with early menopause experiencing CP. It could also contribute to developing strategies for preventing or managing CP in women entering menopause earlier than average, leading to better healthcare practices and support systems.

In conclusion, we discovered that early menopause is independently linked with higher prevalence of CP, and a similar trend was observed for CWP in the combined sample of women with natural and induced menopause. However, no association was found in women with induced menopause alone. Because RLS is highly correlated to age at menopause, it should not be viewed as an independent variable.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115SF8aJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

### Contraception for midlife women [^115dwTQH]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a decline in fertility, women of older reproductive age who do not desire pregnancy should use contraception until menopause. Unintended pregnancy can be disruptive at any age, but in older women, pregnancy is associated with higher rates of adverse health outcomes for the mother and the fetus because of advanced age and comorbid medical conditions (e.g., hypertension or diabetes). Therefore, providing appropriate contraceptive care to women of older reproductive age is critical.

Key Points

Questions

How do premenopausal women with early breast cancer use contraception, and what are the chosen methods and factors associated with contraceptive use?

Findings

In this cohort study of 2900 premenopausal women with early breast cancer enrolled in the prospective Cancer Toxicity study, 54.2% of patients reported contraceptive use at the time of diagnosis, with most patients using hormonal methods. Contraceptive use significantly decreased after primary treatment and during follow-up, when most patients reported use of reversible mechanical methods.

Meaning

These findings support the importance of raising awareness and improving targeted contraceptive counseling among premenopausal women with early breast cancer.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114vNTEq]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

Hormonal Contraceptive Use Among Women of Older Reproductive Age: Considering Risks and Benefits 4 2018 By Tepper, Naomi K.; Godfrey, Emily M.; Folger, Suzanne G. ;. Source: J Womens Health. 27: 413–417 English. Details: Alternative Title: J Womens Health Personal Author: Description: As women approach menopause, fertility declines but pregnancy can still occur. Maternal and infant risks are increased among women of older reproductive age compared with younger women.

A high proportion of pregnancies among women of older reproductive age are unintended and these pregnancies can also be associated with negative maternal and infant consequences. However, women and their healthcare providers may have concerns about risks associated with contraceptive use, particularly combined hormonal contraceptives, among women of older reproductive age who already may be at increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Nonetheless, available evidence does not suggest that hormonal contraceptive use among women of older reproductive age substantially increases age-related risks of cardiovascular events or breast cancer. CDC recommends that contraception is still needed for women older than 44 years who have not reached menopause and wish to avoid pregnancy, and that based on age alone, all contraceptive methods are considered safe or generally safe for use by women of older reproductive age.

### Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies [^114TpVo8]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Menarche and menopause mark the onset and cessation, respectively, of ovarian activity associated with reproduction, and affect breast cancer risk. Our aim was to assess the strengths of their effects and determine whether they depend on characteristics of the tumours or the affected women.

Methods

Individual data from 117 epidemiological studies, including 118 964 women with invasive breast cancer and 306 091 without the disease, none of whom had used menopausal hormone therapy, were included in the analyses. We calculated adjusted relative risks (RRs) associated with menarche and menopause for breast cancer overall, and by tumour histology and by oestrogen receptor expression.

Findings

Breast cancer risk increased by a factor of 1.050 (95% CI 1.044–1.057; p < 0.0001) for every year younger at menarche, and independently by a smaller amount (1.029, 1.025–1.032; p < 0.0001), for every year older at menopause. Premenopausal women had a greater risk of breast cancer than postmenopausal women of an identical age (RR at age 45–54 years 1.43, 1.33–1.52, p < 0.001). All three of these associations were attenuated by increasing adiposity among postmenopausal women, but did not vary materially by women's year of birth, ethnic origin, childbearing history, smoking, alcohol consumption, or hormonal contraceptive use. All three associations were stronger for lobular than for ductal tumours (p < 0.006 for each comparison). The effect of menopause in women of an identical age and trends by age at menopause were stronger for oestrogen receptor-positive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease (p < 0.01 for both comparisons).

Interpretation

The effects of menarche and menopause on breast cancer risk might not be acting merely by lengthening women's total number of reproductive years. Endogenous ovarian hormones are more relevant for oestrogen receptor-positive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease and for lobular than for ductal tumours.

Menopause and perimenopause definitions — Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle and is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period; perimenopause is the few-year time period preceding the final menstrual period, characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea and often vasomotor symptoms. US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

### Contraceptive needs of the perimenopausal woman [^111j4ykp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Although there are many definitions of the perimenopause, all include the concept of transition from physiologic ovulatory menstrual cycles to hyperestrogenic anovulation and ultimately to hypoestrogenic ovarian shutdown. With this comes a transition from childbearing, and its requirement for contraception, to the infertility of menopause. There is no contraceptive method that is contraindicated merely by age. The contraceptive needs of the perimenopausal woman, however, may be better suited to some methods over others. This article explores various methods of contraception for the perimenopausal woman, including female sterilization, barrier methods, intrauterine devices, injectables, implants, and oral contraceptives.

### Menopause: hormones, lifestyle, and optimizing aging [^115uQdHc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although American women spend approximately 30% to 40% of their lives in menopause, a state defined by the cessation of estrogen production by the ovaries, obstetricians and gynecologists in North America receive little formal education about menopausal health. Hormonal therapy has been available for more than 75 years; however, controversies surrounding its use have impacted training of care providers in all specialties. This article offers updates on care for menopausal women, focusing on symptomatology and health issues that arise related to the decline in all reproductive hormones. Lifestyle adaptations and nonmedical approaches, and nonhormonal and hormonal medications are discussed.

Evidence grading and interpretation of studies — Recommendations are graded as Level I (Based on good and consistent scientific evidence), Level II (Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence), or Level III (Based primarily on consensus and expert opinion). Findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of hormone therapy can be interpreted with greater confidence than observational studies (Level I), and smaller effect sizes may be less clinically relevant, particularly for rare outcomes (Level I).

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^112z5taw]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — indication for hormone therapy — states that leading medical societies devoted to the care of menopausal women agree that the decision to initiate hormone therapy should be for the indication of treatment of menopause-related symptoms, and although research is ongoing and these recommendations may be modified over time, there is no question that hormone therapy has an important role in managing symptoms for women during the menopausal transition and in early menopause.

### Guideline no. 422e: menopause and cardiovascular disease [^117X5rMo]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of cardiovascular risks, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering a tissue-selective estrogen complex without a progestin to provide menopausal hormone therapy and uterine protection for relief of early menopausal symptoms, as these agents do not appear to be associated with cardiovascular risk.

### Don't obtain follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women… [^115nuLeY]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Menstrual bleeding patterns for women after age 40 are less predictable than in the younger years due to the normal menopausal transition. Menopause is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for one year when no other cause can be identified. During this time, blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone vary both from woman to woman and from day to day in the same woman. A follicle-stimulating hormone level does not predict when the transition to menopause will occur, diagnose that it has begun, or provide reassurance that contraception is no longer necessary. If there are no other causes of irregular or abnormal bleeding, the treatment for these women will not change based on the follicle-stimulating hormone level.

### Contraception for midlife women: a review [^111cAGkb]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Family planning represents a key component of reproductive health care. Accordingly, the provision of contraception must span the reproductive age spectrum, including perimenopause. The risk of pregnancy is decreased, but not trivial, among women over 40 years of age. Evidence-based guidelines for contraceptive use can assist clinicians in counseling their patients in this population. Intrauterine contraception is one of the most effective methods and is safe to use in midlife women with few exceptions. Progestin-only contraception is another safe option for most midlife women because it is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Combined (estrogen-containing) contraception can be safely used by midlife women who do not have cardiovascular risk factors. Unique noncontraceptive benefits for this population include: improvement in abnormal uterine bleeding, decreased hot flashes, and decreased cancer risk. Finally, guidelines state that contraception can be used by midlife women without medical contraindications until the age of menopause, at which time they may consider transition to systemic hormone therapy.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114cs6Gh]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle. It is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, is the few-year time period preceding a person's final menstrual period and is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age, and US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

Objective

To update its 2017 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons and whether outcomes vary by age or by timing of intervention after menopause.

Population

Asymptomatic postmenopausal persons who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons with an intact uterus has no net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy. (D recommendation).

The normal female lifecycle is associated with hormonal milestones, including menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement sex hormones. Attacks of migraine without aura, but not with aura, are more likely to occur 2 days before onset and on the first 2 days of menses, but they are not more severe than those that occur outside the perimenstrual period. Oral sumatriptan and naratriptan are effective as short-term perimenstrual prophylaxis. Postdural headache can occur during the postpartum period. The International Headache Society Task Force assessed the efficacy of treatment of women who had migraine with combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, as well as the risk of ischemic stroke associated with their use. There is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives in women with migraine in the absence of migraine aura or other risk factors. There is a potentially increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine who are using combined oral contraceptives and have additional risk factors that cannot easily be controlled, including migraine with aura. There is no compelling evidence that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy either decreases or increases stroke risk.

The clinical update serves as a brief review of recently published, high-impact, and potentially practice changing journal articles summarized for our readers. Topics include menopause, sexual dysfunction, breast health, contraception, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. For this clinical update, we reviewed both reproductive and general medical journals for clinically relevant publications related to the use of contraceptive methods. We have chosen to highlight articles examining the extended use of highly effective (long-acting) methods, complications of implants, risks associated with oral combined hormonal contraceptives, and the availability of over the counter contraception.

### Menopause, reproductive life, hormone replacement therapy, and bone phenotype at age 60–64 years: a British birth cohort [^115VvP6W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison with other studies and interpretation

Natural menopause, length of reproductive life, and bone

Previous studies have shown that an earlier natural menopause and a shorter reproductive life are associated with lower BMD. Using transilial biopsy specimens, Akhter et al observed that across the menopause transition, there was decreasing bone tissue volume to total volume and trabecular number and increased trabecular spacing, which would explain the changes in microarchitecture detected as lower BMD using DXA or pQCT. Our findings show that the inverse associations with early menopause and shorter reproductive life persist into the seventh decade of life and are observed for vBMD and aBMD. Whether these effects will eventually be attenuated by age as a risk factor for fracture and so have little long-term effect on hip fracture risk, as indicated in the Million Women Study, cannot yet be determined, but our study has one of the longest follow-up periods to date.

There is a need to separate age- and menopause-related mechanisms that affect bone health. Although the loss of BMD is initially in the trabecular compartment and in women is most strongly related to menopause, it is followed by an equivalent decline in cortical vBMD because endo- and intracortical resorption accelerates and periosteal expansion slows, leading to a reduction in cortical area, and consequently in bone strength. Factors other than declining sex hormones may play a greater role in this aspect of bone loss and may explain why the associations between natural menopause and reproductive life and bone differed from the associations evident for HRT use.

Our finding that a shorter reproductive life was associated with lower BMD suggests that lifetime cumulative estrogen exposure may be important. In determining the duration of endogenous estrogens, Hagemans et al concluded that knowing age at menarche and menopause was sufficient; having information on parity, miscarriages, lactation, oral contraceptive use, and length of menstrual cycle did not explain any further variation in BMD, adding strength to the observations in the current study. Various other factors that we are unable to study will contribute to menopausal bone loss such as declining levels of estradiol and FSH, cytokines, genetic factors, and bone, muscle, and fat interactions.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116fv8Zt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

### Is it possible to investigate menopausal age? A comparative cross-sectional study of five cohorts between 1968 and 2017 from the population study of women in gothenburg, Sweden [^116Uj6UR]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine if the previously found trend of increasing menopausal age is continuing, taking into consideration hormonal use and surgical menopause in both 38- and 50-year-old women of today.

Methods

Cohort comparisons of five generations of population-based samples of 38- and 50-year-old women from the Prospective Population Study of Women in Gothenburg with start in 1968/1969, and with follow-ups in 1980/1981, 1992/1993, 2004/2005, and 2016/2017. Across the time periods newly recruited women as well as earlier participants were included. Use of hormonal contraceptives, estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT), and time for menopause was registered. Changes between different generations of 38- and 50-year-old women from 1968/1969 until today were studied. The overall sample size across the time periods was 1,873 individuals.

Results

The prevalence of oral contraceptives in 38-year-old women was about 10% in 1968/1969, increasing from 16% in 2004/2005 to almost 22% in 2016/2017. From 2004/2005 the use of hormonal intrauterine contraceptive method (the Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS]) increased from about 11% to 14% in 2016/2017. The same pattern was found in 50-year-old women using LNG-IUS, increasing from 6% to 15.5% between 2004/2005 and 2016/2017. The total hormonal use, including LNG-IUS, oral contraceptives, and EPT, was 28% in 50-year-old women in 2016/2017. The total proportion of hormone use in 50-year-old women increased over the years and together with surgical menopause it reached over 37% in the 2016/2017 survey.

Conclusions

This study has shown an increase in the hormonal use, in both 38- and 50-year-old women, making it difficult to determine when the actual menopause occurs. Thus, the previously found increasing secular trend in menopausal age will be more complicated to assess in female generations of today and tomorrow.

### Setting global standards: the paramount importance of considering contraceptive values and preferences of clients and providers [^1179X9dV]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

When considering the views and preferences of individuals, there are additional important aspects that distinguish contraception from other health services or interventions. First, reproductive age can span 30–40 years, beginning from early adolescence and extending to menopause in the case of a woman (approximately age 15–49). It is entirely understandable that the contraceptive needs and preferences of an adolescent will be different from an adult. Second, the importance of pregnancy prevention is influenced by life circumstances and situations, which can change significantly throughout the life course. Additionally, preferences around contraception may vary depending upon a particular method's characteristics and features: e.g. hormonal vs. non-hormonal, long-acting versus short-acting, delivery system, effectiveness and whether there are side effects or other concerns. Again, the relative importance of these aspects of contraception may vary both between individuals and across an individual's lifespan. With more than 15 different forms of safe and effective forms of contraception available, one cannot assume a 'one size fits all' approach.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to administer estrogen-progestogen regimens either continuously (estrogen-progestogen taken every day) or following a cyclic regimen, with estrogen taken every day and progestogen taken for 12–14 days every month. Consider administering estrogen alone taken every day in patients with hysterectomy.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^111zbUzT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone are principal hormones in a woman's life. Before menopause, women are exposed to regularly varying levels of endogenous estrogens and progesterone released during repeated menstrual cycles and potentially to more sustained levels of these hormones during pregnancy. Reproductive-age women may be further exposed to these hormones via oral contraceptives, composed of a progestin with or without an estrogen, and other forms of hormonal contraception. Near or after menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) — estrogen alone or combined with a progestin — may be offered to mitigate menopausal symptoms arising from precipitous declines in endogenous estrogen production and to reduce the risk of bone fractures. – Women with prior use of oral contraceptive pills show a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Despite the intended medical effects and additional health benefits, these hormonal agents, especially estrogens, remain a lingering concern for breast cancer risk. –

In this review, we have aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between estrogens and breast cancer. Given the expansive scope of scientific investigations pertaining to this topic, we focus on findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses with rigor and a large sample size, as well as preclinical mechanistic studies. To be inclusive on the topic with depth, we examined vast evidence, via extensive search on PubMed, from clinical and basic experimental studies, which include hormonal contraceptives, HRT, estrogen-elevating fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), reproductive factors, steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, breast cancer therapies, basic experimental studies, and animal research. Ultimately, we have sought to connect the dots by critically assessing and cohesively integrating wide-ranging, oft-incongruent findings into the conclusions based on the totality of current evidence.

### Oral contraceptive use in perimenopause [^112gaXr4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Perimenopause represents a transition period lasting about 5 years before the permanent cessation of spontaneous menses. During this transition, the emphasis of clinical care changes. Although women still need effective contraception during perimenopause, issues including loss of bone mineral density, menstrual cycle changes, and vasomotor instability also need to be addressed. Hormone replacement therapy is not the first-line treatment for women with symptomatic perimenopause because hormone replacement therapy neither suppresses ovulation nor provides contraception; also, it will not prevent and in fact may aggravate unpredictable perimenopausal bleeding. Oral contraceptives offer many benefits for healthy, nonsmoking, perimenopausal women. Oral contraceptive use by women in their 40s has been found to decrease the risk of postmenopausal hip fractures and regularize menses in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, reducing the need for surgical intervention for benign menstrual conditions. Use of oral contraceptives also can reduce long-term risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers. There is also good evidence that oral contraceptives relieve vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal women. Oral contraceptives can be viewed as a strategy not only to improve perimenopausal symptoms, provide effective contraception, and reduce some long-term health risks, but also to enhance the quality of life for perimenopausal women.

### Steroidal contraceptives and bone fractures in women: evidence from observational studies [^116X5HeJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of skeletal fractures, especially those of the hip, spine, and wrist. Steroidal contraceptives have been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women. Whether such changes affect the risk of fractures later in life is unclear. Hormonal contraceptives are among the most effective and most widely-used contraceptives. Concern about fractures may limit the use of these effective contraceptives. Observational studies can collect data on premenopausal contraceptive use as well as fracture incidence later in life.

Objectives

We systematically reviewed the evidence from observational studies of hormonal contraceptive use for contraception and the risk of fracture in women.

Search Methods

Through June 2015, we searched for observational studies. The databases included PubMed, POPLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), LILACS, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We also searched for recent clinical trials through ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. For other studies, we examined reference lists of relevant articles and wrote to investigators for additional reports.

Selection Criteria

We included cohort and case-control studies of hormonal contraceptive use. Interventions included comparisons of a hormonal contraceptive with a non-hormonal contraceptive, no contraceptive, or another hormonal contraceptive. The primary outcome was the risk of fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. One author entered the data into RevMan, and a second author verified accuracy. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS), developed for case-control and cohort studies. Sensitivity analysis included studies of moderate or high quality based on our assessment with the NOS. Given the need to control for confounding factors in observational studies, we used adjusted estimates from the models as reported by the authors. Where we did not have adjusted analyses, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Due to varied study designs, we did not conduct meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 14 studies (7 case-control and 7 cohort studies). These examined oral contraceptives (OCs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). This section focuses on the sensitivity analysis with six studies that provided moderate or high quality evidence. All six studies examined oral contraceptive use. We noted few associations with fracture risk. One cohort study reported OC ever-users had increased risk for all fractures (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34). However, a case-control study with later data from a subset reported no association except for those with 10 years or more since use (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.33). Another case-control study reported increased risk only for those who had 10 or more prescriptions (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16). A cohort study of postmenopausal women found no increased fracture risk for OC use after excluding women with prior fracture. Two other studies found little evidence of association between OC use and fracture risk. A cohort study noted increased risk for subgroups, such as those with longer use or specific intervals since use. A case-control study reported increased risk for any fracture only among young women with less than average use. Two case-control studies also examined progestin-only contraceptives. One reported increased fracture risk for DMPA ever-use (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.06), more than four years of use (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.53), and women over 50 years old. The other reported increased risk for any past use, including one or two prescriptions (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29) and for current use of 3 to 9 prescriptions (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) or 10 or more (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.78). For the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, one study reported reduced fracture risk for ever-use (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87) and for longer use.

Authors' Conclusions

Observational studies do not indicate an overall association between oral contraceptive use and fracture risk. Some reported increased risk for specific user subgroups. DMPA users may have an increased fracture risk. One study indicated hormonal IUD use may be associated with decreased risk. Observational studies need adjusted analysis because the comparison groups usually differ. Investigators should be clear about the variables examined in multivariate analysis.

### Reproductive hormones and cancer: ovarian and colon cancer [^115FpE2h]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Evidence continues to accumulate that oral contraceptive use provides substantial protection against ovarian cancer. Less clear is whether the benefit affects women with genetic predisposition or women in the perimenopausal age range. The role of hormone replacement therapy in the occurrence of ovarian cancer is unclear. Available evidence suggests that if there is any potential risk, it involves women who use estrogen alone. Few women if any entering the menopause are at risk. There is some evidence that oral contraceptives have a favorable impact on the risk of colorectal cancer. Available data are limited. Finally, there is growing evidence that hormone replacement therapy reduces risk of colorectal cancer, a benefit that accrues to perimenopausal women.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: extended use of long-acting reversible contraception [^111VpfVG]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Copper 380 mm2 IUD extended use — Evidence supports use to 12 years with high effectiveness; a WHO-conducted study reported no pregnancies between 8 and 12 years with 356 women completing 10 years, and another cohort prospectively followed 228 women beyond 10 years. Overall, data support continued efficacy for 2 additional years of use and with some evidence up to 5 additional years. Patients should be counseled that the contraceptive effectiveness of the copper 380 mm2 IUD is maintained beyond the current FDA-approved duration of 10 to 12 years (GRADE 1B). For patients over age 30 at the time of insertion, extended use beyond 12 to 20 years or to menopause can be considered as a form of permanent, reversible contraception (GRADE 1C).

Women of childbearing age with hypercholesterolemia who plan to become pregnant should stop the statin 1 to 2 months before pregnancy is attempted, or if they become pregnant while on a statin, should have the statin stopped as soon as the pregnancy is discovered.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113ZjVvs]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer and hormone therapy — use of oral contraceptives is associated with a significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk (Level I). Current and recent hormone therapy use is associated with a small but statistically significant risk of ovarian cancer in observational studies, principally for serous type, although there was no increase in ovarian cancer risk in women randomized to estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) in the WHI (Level II). In women with a history of ovarian cancer, benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks, especially with bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) or early menopause; use of hormone therapy is not advised in hormone-dependent ovarian cancers, including granulosa-cell tumors and low-grade serous carcinoma (Level II). Short-term hormone therapy appears safe in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants who undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before the average age of menopause (Level II).

### Steroidal contraceptives: effect on bone fractures in women [^111ydzNC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Steroidal contraceptive use has been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women. Whether such changes increase the risk of fractures later in life is not clear. However, osteoporosis is a major public health concern. Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of fracture, especially of the spine, hip, and wrist. Concern about bone health influences the recommendation and use of these effective contraceptives globally.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of using hormonal contraceptives before menopause on the risk of fracture in women

Search Strategy

We searched for studies of fracture or bone health and hormonal contraceptives in MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS, as well as in clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We wrote to investigators to find additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials were considered if they examined fractures, bone mineral density (BMD), or bone turnover in women with hormonal contraceptive use prior to menopause. Studies were excluded if hormones were provided for treatment of a specific condition rather than for contraception. Interventions could include comparisons of a hormonal contraceptive with a placebo or with another hormonal contraceptive. Interventions could also include the provision of a supplement versus a placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed for inclusion all titles and abstracts identified through the literature searches with no language limitation. The mean difference was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found 13 RCTs, 2 of which used a placebo. No trial had fracture as an outcome but most measured BMD. Combination contraceptives did not appear to affect bone health. Of progestin-only methods, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was associated with decreased bone mineral density, while results were inconsistent for implants. The two placebo-controlled trials showed BMD increases for DMPA plus estrogen supplement and decreases for DMPA plus placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. Due to different interventions, no trials could be combined for meta-analysis. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses to follow up. Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. For example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. Progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.

### Sex hormone-related factors and the risk of PIRA in women with multiple sclerosis [^114Pe4by]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sex-related differences affect multiple sclerosis (MS), but the impact of sex hormones on disease progression remains unclear. We investigated whether sex hormone-related factors influence progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in women with MS over a long-term follow-up.

Methods

The study analysed 1210 female MS patients from the San Raffaele MS Center using data from an environmental survey (2019–2023). PIRA was defined as 12-week confirmed disability progression independent of recent relapses (< 30days). Cox proportional-hazard models (adjusted for confounding factors) were used to assess the effect of hormone-related factors on PIRA risk.

Results

Patients who used oral contraceptives before MS diagnosis had a 26% lower risk of PIRA and a delayed median time to the first PIRA event (9.94 vs 7.5 years; HR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.89; p = 0.0018). Conversely, menopause at diagnosis (HR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.67; p = 0.0022) and pregnancy before diagnosis (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.006 to 1.47; p = 0.043) were associated with a shorter time to PIRA. No significant differences were found with abortion, menstrual irregularity or fertility therapy.

Conclusions

This study suggests that early oral contraceptives may delay future disability progression, supporting the importance of sex hormones in MS and prompting further prospective investigations on oral contraceptives to slow disease progression.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112KStrp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer — combined estrogen–progestogen therapy (EPT) is linked to higher risk and timing/regimen effects: Studies report a consistent increase in breast cancer risk, and in WHI women ages 50 to 59 the excess risk of invasive breast cancer during the intervention phase persisted 7 years after cessation of EPT, with 4.5 excess cases/ 1000 over 5 years (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03–1.75); observational data suggest that progesterone or dydrogesterone may be associated with a lower risk, and greater risk is reported when EPT is started close to menopause and with continuous rather than cyclic regimens.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

### Contraception in perimenopause [^113TidVz]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) — hormone therapy (HT) principles and indications specify that HT is recommended for women with POI until the usual age of menopause for primary prevention to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality, whether there are estrogen deficiency symptoms or not; women with POI should be advised that HT is recommended for the treatment of symptoms due to low estrogen concentrations; the guideline group recommends that when women with POI reach the age at which usual menopause occurs, HCPs consider the need for continued HT based on a personalised risk-benefit assessment and current evidence; the guideline group recommends that HCPs advise women with POI that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not provide contraception, in order to assist them with their family planning; and in women with POI with evidence of intermittent ovarian function and desiring natural pregnancy, recommendations for HRT remain unchanged, and do not impact chances of natural conception, with a sequential HRT regimen recommended.

### Biological and social reproductive factors and late-life cognitive function in middle-aged and older Chinese women [^116GFD2V]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study is the first to concurrently examine the associations between reproductive factors and cognitive performance in middle‐aged and older women from both physiological and sociocultural perspectives. Drawing on nationally representative longitudinal data from China, we found that a longer reproductive lifespan was positively associated with better cognitive outcomes in postmenopausal women. In contrast, a higher number of biological children was associated with an elevated risk of cognitive impairment, with this adverse association significantly more pronounced in women than in men. These findings provide novel evidence on the cognitive implications of women's reproductive history and underscore the importance of integrating biological and social reproductive factors into dementia risk assessment and prevention strategies.

Accumulating evidence from large‐scale cohorts and meta‐analyses supports a robust association between female reproductive factors and later‐life cognitive health. Reproductive lifespan — an indicator of cumulative estrogen exposure — has been linked consistently to better cognitive outcomes. Studies from the United States and Singapore report that shorter reproductive spans are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Meta‐analyses involving millions of women confirm that shorter reproductive span elevates the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Later menopause, reflecting a longer reproductive lifespan, is consistently associated with better cognition, whereas earlier menopause increases dementia risk across North America, Europe, and Asia. These associations are further supported by pooled analyses from multinational prospective studies. Evidence regarding age at menarche and later‐life cognition is more mixed. Some studies suggest that later menarche increases dementia risk, whereas others — including findings from the UK Biobank — report the opposite. A dose–response meta‐analysis indicated a J‐shaped association, and several studies found no significant link. Confounding by early‐life adversity and lower socioeconomic status — both associated with earlier menarche — may obscure underlying biological effects. Earlier menarche is also linked to younger maternal age at first birth, which has been associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in later life. Estrogen appears neuroprotective across both direct and indirect measures. Higher postmenopausal estradiol levels are inversely associated with Alzheimer's risk, and hormonal contraceptive use, is linked to slower cognitive decline. However, the cognitive effects of hormone therapy (HT) remain debated, with benefits potentially dependent on formulation, dosage, and especially timing of initiation, ideally within 5 years of menopause. Neuroimaging studies further demonstrate that premature ovarian insufficiency is linked to structural and functional brain alterations, such as reduced gray matter volume, increased white matter hyperintensities, impaired synaptic integrity, and accelerated prefrontal cortical aging. Our findings from a Chinese cohort confirm that a longer reproductive lifespan is associated with better late‐life cognition in women, supporting a neuroprotective role of prolonged estrogen exposure. Although later menopause and later menarche were also linked to better cognition in some covariate‐adjusted models, these associations appear less robust compared with reproductive lifespan.

### Contraception and hormonal management in the perimenopause [^114KJDuF]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

This literature review focuses on contraception in perimenopausal women. As women age, their fecundity decreases but does not disappear until menopause. After age 40, 75% of pregnancies are unplanned and may result in profound physical and emotional impact. Clinical evaluation must be relied on to diagnose menopause, since hormonal levels fluctuate widely. Until menopause is confirmed, some potential for pregnancy remains; at age 45, women's sterility rate is 55%. Older gravidas experience higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and death. Many safe and effective contraceptive options are available to perimenopausal women. In addition to preventing an unplanned and higher-risk pregnancy, perimenopausal contraception may improve abnormal uterine bleeding, hot flashes, and menstrual migraines. Long-acting reversible contraceptives, including the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), the etonogestrel subdermal implant (ESI), and the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD), provide high efficacy without estrogen. LNG-IUS markedly decreases menorrhagia commonly seen in perimenopause. Both ESI and LNG-IUS provide endometrial protection for women using estrogen for vasomotor symptoms. Women without cardiovascular risk factors can safely use combined hormonal contraception. The CDC's Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use informs choices for women with comorbidities. No medical contraindications exist for levonorgestrel emergency-contraceptive pills, though obesity does decrease efficacy. In contrast, the Cu-IUD provides reliable emergency and ongoing contraception regardless of body mass index (BMI).

### Is age at menopause increasing across Europe? Results on age at menopause and determinants from two population-based studies [^1125gBEN]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the variability and determinants of menopause age in two European cohort studies, the European Respiratory Health Survey and the Swiss Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults Cohort.

Methods

Age at menopause was estimated in 5,288 women, aged 30 to 60 years, randomly selected in nine European countries between 1998 and 2002. Determinants of natural and surgically induced menopause were investigated by Cox regression and heterogeneity by meta-analysis. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed in a subsample.

Results

A quarter of the women were postmenopausal by age 50.8 years. Median age of natural menopause was 54 years. Hormone levels were within expected ranges for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Surgically induced menopause was highly prevalent (22%-47%), associated with earlier timing of menopause. Determinants of earlier menopause were current smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27–1.98), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (HR, 1.32; 95%, CI, 1.02–1.70), and low physical activity (HR, 1.37; 95%, CI, 1.12–1.67). The determinant for later menopause was multiparity (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62–0.89). Predictors were similar for naturally and surgically induced menopause. Oral contraceptive use yielded heterogeneous effects on timing of menopause. Later birth was associated with later menopause (HR, 0.934; 95% CI, 0.91–0.96). This evidence of a secular trend is heterogeneous across countries.

Conclusions

Age at menopause varies across Europe, shifting toward higher ages. This secular trend seems paradoxical because several adult determinants, that is, overweight, smoking, sedentarity, and nulliparity, associated with early menopause are on the rise in Europe. The heterogeneity of the secular trend suggests additional country-specific factors not included in the study, such as improved childhood nutrition and health, that have an influence on reproductive aging.

When Contraceptive Protection Is No Longer Needed

Contraceptive protection is still needed for patients aged > 44 years who want to avoid becoming pregnant.

Comments and Evidence Summary. The age at which a person is no longer at risk for becoming pregnant is not known. Although uncommon, spontaneous pregnancies occur among persons aged > 44 years. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the North American Menopause Society recommend that women continue contraceptive use until menopause or age 50–55 years. The median age of menopause is approximately 51 years in North America but can vary from 40 to 60 years. The median age of definitive loss of natural fertility is 41 years but can range up to 51 years. No reliable laboratory tests are available to confirm definitive loss of fertility in a woman; the assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone levels to determine when a woman is no longer fertile might not be accurate.

Health care providers should consider the risks for becoming pregnant in a patient of advanced reproductive age, as well as any risks of continuing contraception until menopause. Pregnancies among women of advanced reproductive age are at higher risk for maternal complications (e.g. hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and death) and fetal complications (e.g. spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies). Risks associated with continuing contraception, in particular risks for acute cardiovascular events (venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or stroke) or breast cancer, also are important to consider. U.S. MEC states that on the basis of age alone, patients of any age can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs and hormonal contraception. However, patients of advanced reproductive age might have chronic conditions or other risk factors that might render use of hormonal contraceptive methods unsafe; U.S. MEC might be helpful in guiding the safe use of contraceptives in these patients.

### Ovarian aging: mechanisms and clinical consequences [^1174kcDx]. Endocrine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Menopause is the final step in the process referred to as ovarian ageing. The age related decrease in follicle numbers dictates the onset of cycle irregularity and the final cessation of menses. The parallel decay in oocyte quality contributes to the gradual decline in fertility and the final occurrence of natural sterility. Endocrine changes mainly relate to the decline in the negative feedback from ovarian factors at the hypothalamo-pituitary unit. The declining cohort of antral follicles with age first results in gradually elevated FSH levels, followed by subsequent stages of overt cycle irregularity. The gradual decline in the size of the antral follicle cohort is best represented by decreasing levels of anti-Mullerian hormone. The variability of ovarian ageing among women is evident from the large variation in age at menopause. The identification of women who have severely decreased ovarian reserve for their age is clinically relevant. Ovarian reserve tests have appeared to be fairly accurate in predicting response to ovarian stimulation in the assisted reproductive technology (ART) setting. The capacity to predict the chances for spontaneous pregnancy or pregnancy after ART appears very limited. As menopause and the preceding decline in oocyte quality seem to have a fixed time interval, tests that predict the age at menopause may be useful to assess individual reproductive lifespan. Especially genetic studies, both addressing candidate gene and genome wide association, have identified several interesting loci of small genetic variation that may determine fetal follicle pool development and subsequent wastage of his pool over time. Improved knowledge of the ovarian ageing mechanisms may ultimately provide tools for prediction of menopause and manipulation of the early steps of folliculogenesis for the purpose of contraception and fertility lifespan extension.

### Secular trends in premature and early menopause in low-income and middle-income countries [^114WwUtE]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The DHS programme identifies a woman as menopausal if they are not pregnant, not postpartum amenorrhoeic and have not had a period in the 6 months preceding the survey; women are also considered to be menopausal if they self-report they are in menopause or had a hysterectomy on the question related to current contraceptive use. We used a modification of this definition by extending the 6-month period to 12 months to align with clinical and epidemiological definitions of menopause and to avoid misclassifying women who are not menopausal yet. Twelve months is also the most commonly used definition in other surveys. (An informal conversation with DHS staff highlighted how the 12 months was not settled until the mid-1990s and given the DHS had started collecting data since the 1980s to insure comparability they chose not to modify the definition.). We have therefore manually coded all 302 surveys calculating the age at menopause based on the age of the respondent at the interview and the time of the last reported menstrual period. We compared the distribution of women using the 6-month DHS definition vs the 12-month DHS definition and we found no major inconsistencies.

After menopausal women were identified, we estimated the prevalence of premature and early menopause, which captures the left tail of the menopause age distribution. We defined premature menopause as the percentage of women who were menopausal among those aged 30–39 years and early menopause as the percentage of women who were menopausal among those aged 40–44 years. For these calculations, all women in each age group, regardless of parity, sexual activity or contraceptive use status, were included in the denominator. Including women who are still using contraception, in particular hormonal long acting which could potentially stop menstruation, could overestimate the number of menopausal women, as contraceptive use has been increasing over this time period throughout all the countries considered. However, this would affect both numerator and denominator. For this reason, we ran a robustness check keeping women using contraception in the sample for comparative purposes and also ran a separate sensitivity analysis for a subsample of countries where we excluded individuals using contraception. The results showed no significant difference in estimated trends. In addition, when we examined the correlation of contraceptive prevalence rates and prevalence of early and premature menopause, we found no to low positive correlations.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^114wRq4g]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that women with natural and induced menopause combined have higher prevalence of CP and CWP with earlier onset of menopause and shorter RLS. This hypothesis has been based on the literature pointing out the association between early menopause and pain. Second, supporting evidence shows that with the start of menopause, greater percentage of women experience osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, general muscle, and joint aches, also for many the diagnosis of fibromyalgia coincides with the onset of menopause. In addition, studies stress that bone density is lower in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women and age-matched men. Such observations were associated with declined level of estradiol due to transition to menopause. Lower estrogen levels in women older than 45 years were associated with higher occurrence of musculoskeletal pain.

Our study has several strengths, including a relatively large sample size and a broad variety of available covariates in the data set. We differentiated between natural and induced menopause, which helped to see if the associations with pain are affected by menopausal reason status. The limited literature on the impact of HT use and hormonal contraceptives on the onset of menopause prompted us to consider specific variables related to sex hormones, alongside lifestyle and demographic factors, to account for numerous covariates in this observational study. By controlling for early menarche, we indirectly consider other health conditions in our study, as it has been associated with numerous diseases.,

The Tromsø7 survey did not differentiate between perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Biophysiological changes related to perimenopause may begin around age 35 years. Thus, hormone-level measurement is necessary to confirm the reproductive stage, as age alone does not predict estradiol levels. Recall of initial menopause age exhibited high correlation 20 years later. By contrast, self-reported age at menarche showed a lower correlation, potentially impacting the variable's reliability. We adjusted for hormonal contraceptive use and HT duration and timing, the analysis lacks information about the types and combinations of hormones in the contraceptives.

Moreover, the cross-sectional design may lead to unmeasured confounding, creating uncertainties in findings and potentially overlooking contributing factors. Also, biases could arise from overcontrolling by adjusting for mediators (factors caused by menopause) and controlling for colliders (factors caused by both menopause and pain).

Evidence notes that CHCs might decrease bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescents, especially with very low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing < 30 μg ethinyl estradiol, with little to no effect on BMD in premenopausal women. Comment states that the risk for cardiovascular disease increases with age and might increase with CHC use, and that in the absence of other adverse clinical conditions, CHCs can be used until menopause.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1133o6H1]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency and premature or early menopause — In the absence of contraindications, hormone therapy is recommended at least until the average age of menopause (approximately age 52 y), with an option for use of oral contraceptives in healthy younger women, and results of the WHI trials in older women do not apply to women with POI or premature or early menopause. Women with POI and premature or early menopause may be at increased risk for fracture, CVD, heart failure, DM, overall mortality, persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive and mood changes, increased risk of dementia, open-angle glaucoma, depression, and poor quality of life. Unless contraindications are present, ET is indicated for women who have had BO before the average age of menopause to treat VMS, improve BMD, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, and younger women may require higher doses to relieve symptoms and protect against bone loss. In women with BO before the average age of menopause, early initiation of ET, with endometrial protection if the uterus is preserved, reduces VMS, genitourinary symptoms, risk for osteoporosis and related fractures, and likely CVD and overall mortality, with benefit seen in observational studies for CV mortality and cognitive impairment or dementia. Contraceptives may be an alternative to hormone therapy, because spontaneous pregnancy may occur in about 5% of women with POI, vaginal estrogens are effective in treating symptoms of GSM, fertility preservation and counseling should be explored for young women at risk for POI, and ovarian conservation is recommended when hysterectomy is performed for benign indications in premenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer.

### Steroidal contraceptives: effect on bone fractures in women [^116endVz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Steroidal contraceptive use has been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women. Whether such changes increase the risk of fractures later in life is not clear. Osteoporosis is a major public health concern. Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of fracture, especially of the spine, hip, and wrist. Concern about bone health influences the recommendation and use of these effective contraceptives globally.

Objectives

Our aim was to evaluate the effect of using hormonal contraceptives before menopause on the risk of fracture in women.

Search Methods

Through April 2014, we searched for studies of fracture or bone health and hormonal contraceptives in MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of relevant articles for other trials. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered if they examined fractures, bone mineral density (BMD), or bone turnover markers in women with hormonal contraceptive use prior to menopause. Eligible interventions included comparisons of a hormonal contraceptive with a placebo or with another hormonal contraceptive that differed in terms of drug, dosage, or regimen. They also included providing a supplement to one group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed all titles and abstracts identified through the literature searches. Mean differences were computed using the inverse variance approach. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Both included the 95% confidence interval (CI) and used a fixed-effect model. Due to differing interventions, no trials could be combined for meta-analysis. We applied principles from GRADE to assess the evidence quality and address confidence in the effect estimates. In addition, a sensitivity analysis included trials that provided sufficient data for this review and evidence of at least moderate quality.

Main Results

We found 19 RCTs that met our eligibility criteria. Eleven trials compared different combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or regimens of COCs; five examined an injectable versus another injectable, implant, or IUD; two studied implants, and one compared the transdermal patch versus the vaginal ring. No trial had fracture as an outcome. BMD was measured in 17 studies and 12 trials assessed biochemical markers of bone turnover. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD). The placebo-controlled trials showed BMD increases for DMPA plus estrogen supplement and decreases for DMPA plus placebo supplement. COCs did not appear to negatively affect BMD, and some formulations had more positive effects than others. However, no COC trial was placebo-controlled. Where studies showed differences between groups in bone turnover markers, the results were generally consistent with those for BMD. For implants, the single-rod etonogestrel group showed a greater BMD decrease versus the two-rod levonorgestrel group but results were not consistent across all implant comparisons. The sensitivity analysis included 11 trials providing evidence of moderate or high quality. Four trials involving DMPA showed some positive effects of an estrogen supplement on BMD, a negative effect of DMPA-subcutaneous on lumbar spine BMD, and a negative effect of DMPA on a bone formation marker. Of the three COC trials, one had a BMD decrease for the group with gestodene plus EE 15 μg. Another indicated less bone resorption in the group with gestodene plus EE 30 μg versus EE 20 μg.

Authors' Conclusions

Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. The evidence quality was considered moderate overall, largely due to the trials of DMPA, implants, and the patch versus ring. The COC evidence varied in quality but was low overall. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. For example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. Progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.

### When contraceptive protection is No longer needed… [^116tSwwd]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary The age at which a person is no longer at risk for becoming pregnant is not known. Although uncommon, spontaneous pregnancies occur among persons aged > 44 years. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the North American Menopause Society recommend that women continue contraceptive use until menopause or age 50–55 years. The median age of menopause is approximately 51 years in North America but can vary from 40 to 60 years. The median age of definitive loss of natural fertility is 41 years but can range up to 51 years. No reliable laboratory tests are available to confirm definitive loss of fertility in a woman; the assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone levels to determine when a woman is no longer fertile might not be accurate.

Health care providers should consider the risks for becoming pregnant in a patient of advanced reproductive age, as well as any risks of continuing contraception until menopause. Pregnancies among women of advanced reproductive age are at higher risk for maternal complications and fetal complications. Risks associated with continuing contraception, in particular risks for acute cardiovascular events or breast cancer, also are important to consider. U. S. MEC states that on the basis of age alone, patients of any age can use was < 5 years previously and for those whose last use of CHCs was 5–9 years previously. Seven more recent studies suggested small but nonsignificant increased relative risks for breast carcinoma in situ or breast cancer among women who had used oral contraceptives or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate when they were aged ≥ 40 years compared with those who had never used either method.

### Use of progestin-containing intrauterine systems in hormone therapy regimens: what are the data? [^116KmcDM]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) is frequently used in perimenopause for contraception and bleeding control and in both perimenopause and menopause for endometrial protection while using estrogen therapy to control bothersome menopause symptoms. The use of an IUS for endometrial protection as part of hormone therapy is off label in the United States but is approved for use in more than 100 countries for up to 5 years. Some IUSs have been approved for contraceptive use for 8 years, and questions remain whether they provide adequate endometrial protection when combined with estrogen therapy beyond 5 years of use.

Contraception services should be part of routine health care maintenance in reproductive-aged women, especially in light of the fact that approximately 50% of pregnancies in the United States remain unplanned. Barrier methods, especially condoms, may play a role in sexually transmitted disease prevention but are less efficacious for pregnancy avoidance. There are several available hormonal contraceptive options, including the combination hormonal pill, progestin-only pill, combination hormonal patches and rings, injectable progestins, implantable progestins, intrauterine devices (copper or progestin), and permanent sterilization. These methods have varying efficacy, often related to patient compliance or tolerance of side effects.

### Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies [^115sUpd8]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

The proportion of different types of breast cancer varies by age and by menopausal status (figure 6). For tumours of known oestrogen receptor status, the proportion that is oestrogen receptor-positive increases with age in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, at ages 45–54 years, where both premenopausal and postmenopausal women are represented, a sudden decrease occurs at menopause in the proportion of oestrogen receptor-positive tumours. Similarly, the proportion of tumours with lobular histology increases with age, with a sudden decrease around the time of menopause. After adjusting by single years of age and other potential confounding factors, the heterogeneity at ages 45–54 years between premenopausal and postmenopausal women is highly significant both for oestrogen receptor status (heterogeneity p = 0.003) and for tumour histology (heterogeneity p < 0.0001, appendix p 11).

In analyses restricted to postmenopausal women, the RR of breast cancer increased by a factor of 1.029 (1.025–1.032, p < 0.0001) for every year older at menopause (figure 3B). The findings in figure 3B were stratified by study, year of birth, age, parity and age at first birth, height, current BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Additional adjustment by ethnic origin, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, and hormonal contraceptive use (both individually and simultaneously) altered the excess RR estimate by less than 1% (data not shown). RRs did not differ significantly between women with a natural menopause (1.030, 1.026–1.034) and bilateral oophorectomy (1.019, 1.004–1.034, heterogeneity p = 0.2; appendix p 12).

Coronary heart disease risk with estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) — women near menopause: An intervention RCT in recently (< 3 y) postmenopausal women ages 42 to 58 found no difference in atherosclerosis progression after 4 years, and the guideline states, "In summary, EPT does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of CHD among women close to the onset of menopause, and if any risk elevation is present in women younger than 60 years, its magnitude is small", while noting that a definitive conclusion requires an appropriately powered RCT.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

Issues specific to women — clinical recommendations for counseling, contraception, and pregnancy management: Clinicians should consider conditions specific to women, such as premature menopause (age < 40 years) and pregnancy-associated disorders, when discussing lifestyle intervention and the potential for benefit of statin therapy. Women of childbearing age on statin therapy who are sexually active should be counseled to use a reliable form of contraception. Women of childbearing age with hypercholesterolemia who plan to become pregnant should stop the statin 1 to 2 months before pregnancy is attempted; if pregnancy occurs while on a statin, the statin should be stopped as soon as the pregnancy is discovered.
