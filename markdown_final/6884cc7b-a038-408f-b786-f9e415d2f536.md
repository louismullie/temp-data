Anticoagulation following cva

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation after cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying stroke etiology and mechanism because that drives therapy. Then, I should verify the optimal timing for starting anticoagulation in cardioembolic stroke, especially atrial fibrillation, including how DOACs change the calculus. Next, I will examine noncardioembolic stroke where antiplatelets, not anticoagulation, are indicated. After that, I need to check special scenarios like cerebral venous thrombosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and left ventricular thrombus. I will then review management after intracerebral hemorrhage, including reversal and when to resume anticoagulation. Finally, I should consider breakthrough stroke on anticoagulation, periprocedural interruptions, and practical DOAC selection and monitoring, ensuring shared decision-making throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: stroke is heterogeneous, and mechanism dictates antithrombotic choice, so I need to classify whether the event is cardioembolic, noncardioembolic (large-artery atherosclerosis or small-vessel), or hemorrhagic before committing to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [^115mMamp].

> For cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation, I should confirm that oral anticoagulation is superior to antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention and that DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin because of lower major bleeding and death. I need to ensure I anchor this to contemporary guidance and trial syntheses [^115wFFni].

> Now, timing is critical. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting immediately after ischemic stroke. I initially thought "start within 4–14 days" per AHA/ASA 2019, but wait, I should verify whether earlier DOAC initiation is safe and beneficial. The CATALYST individual patient data meta-analysis shows that starting a DOAC within 4 days reduces recurrent ischemic stroke without increasing symptomatic ICH compared with starting at day 5 or later, which supports earlier initiation when hemorrhagic risk is acceptable [^116iyueR] [^117VLExR].

> I should double-check how infarct size modifies timing. For small, non-disabling infarcts, starting within 1–3 days is reasonable. For moderate infarcts, waiting about 6 days is prudent. For large infarcts with NIHSS > 15 or multiterritory involvement, delaying to 2–3 weeks reduces hemorrhagic transformation risk. If hemorrhagic transformation is present, I need to individualize and often extend the delay, as no randomized trial definitively answers this question [^112C8CjC] [^1164wsPx].

> For TIA without infarct on imaging, I should confirm that immediate anticoagulation is favored because the early recurrence risk is high and hemorrhagic risk is low. Guidelines explicitly support starting OAC right away in this scenario, which aligns with the pathophysiology and risk trade-off [^113GM8Kx] [^115ig6tf].

> Next, I will examine noncardioembolic stroke. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize anticoagulation here. Antiplatelet therapy is the evidence-based secondary prevention strategy, and switching to warfarin is not indicated. Early anticoagulation in acute noncardioembolic stroke does not improve outcomes and increases bleeding, so I should avoid it outside of specific indications like cerebral venous thrombosis or antiphospholipid syndrome [^115b3X9A] [^111vKaDj].

> Let me consider cerebral venous thrombosis specifically. Therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is indicated even in the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage at baseline, and duration is typically at least 3–6 months, with consideration of indefinite anticoagulation in recurrent CVT or persistent high-risk prothrombotic states. I should confirm that both ESO and AHA/ASA-aligned guidance support this approach [^116g1Uox] [^111F8VUw] [^114kr2L6].

> For antiphospholipid syndrome, I should verify that DOACs are not recommended due to higher arterial thrombosis risk, particularly stroke. Warfarin with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 remains the standard for secondary prevention after arterial events, and I need to be cautious not to substitute a DOAC in this setting [^113aGwKJ] [^115BCcZC] [^113iwHky].

> Regarding left ventricular thrombus after myocardial infarction, I need to check that warfarin for at least 3 months is recommended to reduce embolic risk, with observational signals suggesting higher stroke or systemic embolism on DOACs compared with warfarin. Thus, VKA remains preferred pending stronger DOAC data, and I should align with guideline-directed therapy here [^112yvfP3] [^116N3PdK].

> Now, I will review intracerebral hemorrhage. I should confirm that anticoagulation must be stopped immediately and reversed urgently when ICH is diagnosed, using 4-factor PCC plus vitamin K for VKAs and specific reversal agents for DOACs, without waiting for lab confirmation if clinical suspicion is high, to mitigate hematoma expansion and mortality [^112BkxQD] [^114w3gkj].

> But wait, what about restarting anticoagulation after ICH? I need to ensure timing balances thrombosis and rebleeding. Observational and guideline syntheses suggest that for most patients without mechanical valves, waiting about 4–8 weeks before resuming OAC is reasonable, with some data pointing to an optimal net benefit around 7–8 weeks. I should individualize based on ICH location, mechanism, and thrombotic risk, and consider aspirin monotherapy initially if anticoagulation must be delayed [^1115sZif] [^1155AHaT].

> For breakthrough ischemic stroke on a DOAC, I should double-check whether switching helps. A recent meta-analysis indicates that switching to warfarin increases ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage compared with staying on the same DOAC or switching to another DOAC, so I should avoid reflexively switching to warfarin and instead reassess adherence, drug interactions, renal function, and dose appropriateness before changing therapy [^114tst6X].

> Periprocedural management requires careful interruption planning. I need to ensure that bridging with LMWH is generally avoided in AF except for mechanical valves or very recent stroke/TIA, and that DOACs are interrupted based on renal function and procedural bleeding risk, with resumption typically the day after low-risk procedures and 2–3 days after high-risk procedures. Shared decision-making is essential here [^114yW3p7].

> For DOAC selection and monitoring, I should confirm that apixaban or edoxaban are preferred in renal impairment, dabigatran and rivaroxaban require dose adjustment with CrCl 15–30 mL/min and are generally avoided below 15 mL/min, and that periodic renal and hepatic function checks, along with bleeding surveillance, are part of routine care. I also need to remember that in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, DOACs are not appropriate due to increased arterial events [^114svfRp] [^113aGwKJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is communicated clearly: anticoagulation is not one-size-fits-all after CVA. It is mechanism-specific, timing-sensitive, and risk-stratified, with DOACs enabling earlier initiation in appropriate cardioembolic cases, antiplatelets remaining first-line for noncardioembolic stroke, and special entities like CVT, APS, and LV thrombus dictating specific regimens. Shared decision-making that weighs ischemic benefit against bleeding risk is integral to safe, effective care [^117VLExR] [^115b3X9A] [^115A85v9].

Anticoagulation after ischemic stroke is indicated for **cardioembolic etiologies** (notably atrial fibrillation) [^115wFFni] and for **cerebral venous thrombosis** [^116g1Uox], with DOACs preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated [^115wFFni]. For non-cardioembolic strokes, **antiplatelet therapy is standard** [^115b3X9A]; anticoagulation is not recommended unless another indication exists [^115b3X9A]. Timing should balance ischemic and bleeding risks: start DOACs at 4–14 days post-stroke in most patients with AF [^116iyueR], earlier after TIA or small infarcts, and later after large infarcts or hemorrhagic transformation [^113GM8Kx] [^112C8CjC] [^1116vKoV]. After intracerebral hemorrhage, **delay anticoagulation 4–8 weeks** [^1155AHaT] and individualize based on thrombotic and bleeding risk [^1115sZif]. Use DOACs cautiously in renal impairment [^116qQedp] and avoid in antiphospholipid syndrome [^113aGwKJ].

## Indications for anticoagulation after ischemic stroke

Anticoagulation is **primarily indicated** for the following scenarios:

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: Cardioembolic strokes from AF require long-term anticoagulation [^115wFFni] to prevent recurrence [^115wFFni].

- **Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)**: Therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended [^116g1Uox] for all patients with CVT, including those with baseline intracerebral hemorrhage [^116g1Uox].

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Lifelong warfarin is required for mechanical valves [^1157N9To].

- **Left ventricular thrombus**: Anticoagulation is indicated for at least 3 months [^notfound] after myocardial infarction with LV thrombus.

---

## Timing of anticoagulation initiation

Timing must balance early recurrence risk against hemorrhagic transformation:

- **General recommendation**: Start oral anticoagulation 4–14 days after ischemic stroke in AF patients [^116iyueR] [^117NqGMJ].

- **Early initiation**: Consider within 4 days for TIA, small infarcts, or low hemorrhagic risk [^117VLExR] [^112C8CjC].

- **Delayed initiation**: Wait 2–3 weeks for large infarcts, NIHSS > 15, or early hemorrhagic transformation [^1116vKoV] [^112C8CjC].

- **Intracerebral hemorrhage**: Delay anticoagulation 4–8 weeks after ICH, individualizing based on thrombotic and bleeding risk [^1155AHaT] [^1115sZif].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are **preferred** over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for most patients due to lower bleeding risk and fewer interactions [^113vdLg2] [^115wFFni]. Warfarin remains indicated for **mechanical heart valves**, severe renal impairment with certain DOACs, and specific patient preferences [^113aUNyF] [^115tRMea] [^114svfRp].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust DOAC dosing; some agents are contraindicated in severe renal impairment [^116qQedp].

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Avoid DOACs; use VKAs with INR 2.0–3.0 [^113aGwKJ].

- **Hemorrhagic transformation**: Delay anticoagulation until stabilization and reassessment [^1164wsPx].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring focuses on **bleeding signs**, renal and hepatic function, and adherence [^114svfRp]. Maintain an INR of 2.0–3.0 for VKAs [^113iwHky] and monitor for interactions and labile INRs [^116oV7Wb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended anticoagulation** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation | DOAC preferred | 4–14 days post-stroke |
| Cerebral venous thrombosis | Therapeutic anticoagulation | Immediately |
| Mechanical heart valves | Warfarin | 4–14 days post-stroke |
| Left ventricular thrombus | Warfarin | ≥ 3 months |
| Intracerebral hemorrhage | Delay anticoagulation | 4–8 weeks |

---

Anticoagulation after ischemic stroke is indicated for **cardioembolic etiologies** and cerebral venous thrombosis, with DOACs preferred in most patients. Timing should balance ischemic and bleeding risks, and special considerations include renal impairment, antiphospholipid syndrome, and hemorrhagic transformation.

Anticoagulant therapy outside atrial fibrillation — Parenteral and oral anticoagulants are effective in the prevention of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic heart valves; however, warfarin anticoagulation has been shown to be less effective than antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of neurologic events in patients with carotid atherosclerosis who do not have a history of atrial fibrillation and is not indicated in patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. The Warfarin-Aspirin Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction Trial study is currently investigating the potential advantage in preventing cardiembolic stroke of anticoagulation vs aspirin in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^114w3gkj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is key to the treatment/prevention of thromboembolic events. The primary complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt anticoagulation reversal; this could also be required for nonbleeding patients requiring urgent/emergent invasive procedures. The decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit-risk ratio of supporting hemostasis versus post-reversal thrombosis. We appraise the available guidelines/recommendations for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal in the management of major bleeding, and also assess recent clinical data that may not yet be reflected in official guidance. In general, available guidelines are consistent in their recommendations, advocating administration of vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) rather than fresh frozen plasma to patients with VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage and life-threatening bleeding, and specific reversal agents as essential therapy for DOAC reversal in those same severe conditions. However, guidelines also recommend off-label use of PCCs for DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are unavailable. Limited recent evidence generally support the latter recommendation, but guidelines are likely to evolve as more data become available.

AHA/ASA 2021 secondary stroke prevention — atrial fibrillation (AF) with transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus stroke: Patients with TIA in the setting of AF have relatively low intracranial hemorrhage risk yet increased recurrent stroke risk, and the balance of bleeding risk versus benefit from oral anticoagulation favors earlier initiation when no cerebral infarction is present, whereas after stroke (particularly large stroke) delay is contrasted due to blood–brain barrier disruption increasing hemorrhage risk with anticoagulation initiation.

ASIPP perioperative antithrombotic management conclusion emphasizes balancing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with interventional pain procedures, noting that managing chronic pain in these patients is "a complex and increasingly common challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach" and that "withholding anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy carries significant risks, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events". It states that "it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize interruptions in anticoagulant therapy while ensuring the safety and efficacy of pain management interventions", highlights "the need for tailored guidelines that consider the specific risks associated with different types of procedures and patient conditions", and adds that adherence to guidance and comprehensive understanding can help clinicians better navigate care, "ultimately improving outcomes and reducing the incidence of adverse events".

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal in intracranial hemorrhage — "We recommend discontinuing VKAs when intracranial hemorrhage is present or suspected (Good Practice statement)". "We recommend urgent reversal of VKAs in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence) with the following considerations:" "We suggest against VKA reversal in patients where there is a high suspicion of intracranial hemorrhage due to cerebral venous thrombosis (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence)". "We recommend assessing risks and benefits when considering VKA reversal in intracranial hemorrhage patients with concurrent symptomatic or life-threatening thrombosis, ischemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or DIC (Good Practice statement)". "We recommend administration of vitamin K to ensure durable reversal of international normalized ratio (INR) following VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage. Vitamin K should be dosed as soon as possible or concomitantly with other reversal agents (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence)". "We suggest one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV. Subsequent treatment should be guided by follow-up INR (Good Practice statement)". "If repeat INR is still elevated greater than or equal to 1.4 within the first 24–48 hours after reversal agent administration, we suggest redosing with vitamin K 10 mg IV (Good Practice statement)".

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) requires caution due to high baseline risk; nonlobar ICH reinitiation "may be considered", observational data suggest resumption yields "50% to 70% lower" thrombosis and death without more recurrent bleeding versus discontinuation, timing in studies ranges "72 hours to 30 weeks", current guidelines "recommend avoiding anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks" without mechanical valves and using aspirin initially if indicated, and the authors "favor delaying" OAC for "at least 4 weeks" in patients without high thrombotic risk. ICH accounts for "approximately 20%" of spontaneous cases with "30-day mortality rates approaching 50%", recurrence risk is influenced by bleed mechanism, lobar location, microbleeds, and ongoing anticoagulation; DOAC safety after ICH switch "has not been evaluated". A randomized trial of 537 post‑ICH patients restarting aspirin showed a trend to less recurrent ICH (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) without reduction in ischemic events (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92), and a large retrospective study reported median OAC restart "approximately 1 month" after bleeding.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus UFH for prophylaxis: When prophylactic anticoagulation is used, the benefit of prophylactic-dose LMWH over prophylactic-dose UFH is uncertain. There were no significant effects on death or disability for LMWH/heparinoids compared with UFH, and LMWH/heparinoid use was associated with a reduction in DVTs (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.44–0.70]) at the expense of a greater risk of major extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.30–11.03]); LMWH can be administered once a day, but higher cost and increased bleeding risk in elderly patients with renal impairment are disadvantages that should be kept in mind.

### Ninety-day stroke or transient ischemic attack recurrence in patients prescribed anticoagulation in the emergency department with atrial fibrillation and a new transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^114ST4u1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are common and may herald a future stroke, with an estimated risk of 3.5% within 48 hours, 4% to 10% within 7 days, and 8% to 12% by 90 days of the index event. TIAs are caused by ischemia from vascular disease or emboli, of which a significant proportion is attributable to cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation. It is well established that patients with atrial fibrillation have nearly a 5‐fold higher risk of stroke, higher recurrence rates, greater disability, longer hospital stays, higher mortality rates, and greater medical costs than those in sinus rhythm. A patient with atrial fibrillation and a prior stroke or TIA has a 2‐fold higher risk of recurrence in comparison to patients without, with 1 study reporting a 5‐year recurrence rate after atrial fibrillation‐related stroke as high as 21.5%.

This elevated baseline risk for stroke or TIA in patients with atrial fibrillation in addition to the high risk of recurrence is well recognized and provides the rationale for early primary and secondary stroke interventions. Oral anticoagulants taken long term prevent ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. The Canadian Best Practice Guidelines recommend that patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation receive oral anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran) or Factor Xa inhibitors (eg, apixaban, rivaroxaban) following ischemic stroke or TIA. These interventions have been shown to be as effective or superior to the previous standard therapy with warfarin in reducing the risk for stroke, embolic events, and all‐cause death.,

However, the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulation in patients following TIA remains controversial, in part because the risks and benefits of anticoagulation likely differ in the short term versus long term. Experts often recommend anticoagulation begin on the same day or 1 day post event, arguing efficacy and medication adherence are best emphasized at the index encounter. Others wonder about drug safety, dose titration, hemorrhagic transformation, and continuity of care following emergency prescribing. As a result, there is disagreement regarding whether oral anticoagulation is best initiated in the emergency department (ED) at the time of an index TIA or minor stroke. However, the early risks and benefits of initiating oral anticoagulation in the ED in patients with atrial fibrillation and new TIA are not known.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether patients with atrial fibrillation and a new TIA or minor stroke have lower rates of stroke, TIA, or all‐cause mortality 90 days after ED‐prescribed anticoagulation.

### Periprocedural anticoagulation [^112kdLNm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of patients taking anticoagulants around the time of a procedure is a common and complex clinical scenario. Providing evidence-based care requires estimation of risk for thrombosis and bleeding, knowledge of commonly used medications, multidisciplinary communication and collaboration, and patient engagement and education. This review provides a standardized, evidence-based approach to periprocedural management of anticoagulation, based on current evidence and expert clinical guidelines.

ACC 2020 oral anticoagulant bleeding — decision to stop or restart anticoagulation after stabilization directs clinicians to first ask, "Once patient is stable, is there a clinical indication for continued OAC?" If no, the pathway states "Suggest discontinuing anticoagulation". If yes, assess "DOES ≥ 1 OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS APPLY?" including critical‑site bleeding, high risk of rebleeding or of death/disability with rebleeding, unidentified source, planned surgical/invasive procedures, or patient preference not to restart; if yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation", and if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation".

### Prophylactic anticoagulation following acute myocardial infarction… [^116N3PdK]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Although several large trials have failed to demonstrate unequivocally that anticoagulation decreases mortality following myocardial infarction, anticoagulation has been advocated to prevent embolic cerebrovascular accidents. Since CVAs occur during hospitalization in only 1. 5% to 3% of MIs, it is not justifiable to anticoagulate all patients after MI because the risk of anticoagulation exceeds the potential benefit. However, a group of patients who are at high risk of developing left ventricular thrombi and CVA following MI can be identified. Thirty percent to 40% of patients with transmural anterior MI develop LVT, and early anticoagulation with heparin sodium prevents LVT formation and CVAs in this group. A two-dimensional echocardiogram before hospital discharge allows the identification of patients at risk for later embolization and helps determine the need for anticoagulation with warfarin sodium following hospitalization.

### Atrial fibrillation detected before or after stroke: role of anticoagulation [^1178PMLP]. Annals of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our findings challenge the notion that KAF and AFDAS are clinically relevant and distinct prognostic entities. Instead of attributing an independently high stroke recurrence risk to KAF, more focus on a thorough investigation of the causes of stroke despite pre‐existing anticoagulation should be placed both in clinical practice and future research as to allow for improved preventive treatments.

### Aetiology, secondary prevention strategies and outcomes of ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115cv98M]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation with either direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there is a substantial residual stroke risk in patients with AF despite anticoagulation ranging from 0.7% to 2.3% annually in primary and secondary prevention, respectively. Since the introduction of DOAC, the overall use of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with AF has increased steadily, particularly in patients with AF at the highest stroke risk. Due to this development, the number of patients with AF suffering a stroke despite anticoagulation is expected to increase, too. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation are at a higher risk for future recurrence than patients who were naive to anticoagulation treatment before stroke.

For stroke physicians, ischaemic stroke despite anticoagulation in patients with AF represents a challenge in everyday clinical practice, as its aetiology is not well-understood. Competing stroke mechanisms such as large artery and small vessel disease, as well as non-adherence or inappropriately dosed anticoagulation have been discussed as potential causes of stroke despite anticoagulation, but few data on their relative frequency exist. A better understanding of the aetiology of stroke despite anticoagulation is needed to inform strategies to prevent recurrence after a stroke despite anticoagulation. So far, limited data suggested no benefit from switching the anticoagulant type. Indeed, the optimal management of patients with stroke despite anticoagulation remains unclear, and the latest guidelines offer no recommendations on this.

We therefore sought to (i) describe the aetiology of stroke despite oral anticoagulation and (ii) investigate subsequent preventive strategies and outcomes in a large collaborative study of patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation from 11 experienced stroke centres.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

Table 6 — original indications for anticoagulation with high thrombotic risk lists conditions and high‑risk features, including mechanical valve prosthesis with or without atrial fibrillation (AF) with "Stroke/TIA within 6 months"; nonvalvular AF with "AF with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥ 4", "Ischemic stroke/TIA within 3 months", and "Stroke risk ≥ 10% per year"; venous thromboembolism (VTE) with "VTE within 3 months", "History of unprovoked or recurrent VTE", and "Active cancer and history of cancer-associated VTE"; and left ventricular thrombus " > 3 months post-MI, if recovery of LV function". Footnotes note that "For patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 4, the annual rate of thromboembolism is 4.9% (2.8%-5.4%)", and specify therapy scope: "Currently, only warfarin is indicated for patients ready to restart their anticoagulation", while "Patients can resume any OAC when ready to restart their anticoagulation".

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^111T3ton]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with cancer have a substantial risk of ischaemic strokes, increasing their morbidity and mortality by more than twofold. This is a commonly recognised but poorly studied clinical situation, which represents a significant management challenge and brings together several medical fields. Ischaemic stroke is the second most common brain lesion in patients with cancer and, after an initial ischaemic stroke, accounts for 31% of all recurrent thromboembolic incidents in these patients. The pathophysiology of cancer-associated ischaemic stroke has been described, but the specific mechanisms linked to distinct patient and disease characteristics are not well known. There are no current diagnostic or therapeutic guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated strokes. Initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention in such circumstance remains controversial and clinical management of these patients is challenging. We describe a case of multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. We present this case to emphasise the need for more studies that could shed light on the risk stratification and appropriate management of recurrent strokes in patients with a history of remote or current cancer. We also want to highlight the lack of current guidelines for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention in cancer-associated strokes.

Atrial fibrillation

Recommendations

For patients ≥ 65 years of age, active screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in community health centres or primary carehospitals by checking pulses combined with electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended (class I; level of evidence B). For high-risk patients, long-term ECG monitoring can increase the detection of undiagnosed AF, which is cost-effective (class IIa; level of evidence A).
For patients with non-valvular AF, a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥ 2 (table 1), and low risk of haemorrhage, anticoagulant therapy is recommended. Options include warfarin (INR2.0–INR3.0), or New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban (class I; level of evidence A), and edoxaban (class I; level of evidence B). The evidence on effective adjustment of warfarin dosage by genotypes is not sufficient (class IIb; level of evidence C).
For patients with non-valvular AF and severe renal impairment (Ccr < 15 mL/min), certain NOACs (dabigatran and rivaroxaban) should not be used (class III; level of evidence C).
For patients with non-valvular AF and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 0, antithrombotic therapy is not recommended (class III; level of evidence B).
For patients with non-valvular AF, a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1, low risk of haemorrhage, and no previous antithrombotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy or aspirin therapy may be considered. The selection of antithrombotics should be determined on an individual basis (class IIb; level of evidence C).
For high-risk patients with AF who are unsuitable for anticoagulation, closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) may be considered when performed at a centre with low rates of periprocedural complications and the patient can tolerate the risk of at least 45 days of postprocedural anticoagulant therapy(class IIb; level of evidence B).

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^113qLJM2]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Consensus statements

The co-occurring and inter-linked nature of CVD requires an integrated care action plan to prevent, identify, treat, and rehabilitate people. This targets the prevention of recurrent stroke, improves patient functional status and symptoms, and manages cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and lifestyle changes

A post-stroke ABC pathway is proposed as a more holistic approach to integrated stroke care and would include three pillars of management:

A: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy.
B: Better functional and psychological status.
C: Cardiovascular risk factors and Comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes).

Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be targeted to the underlying comorbidity, for example, anticoagulation for patients with AF.

When stroke patients have both AF and vascular disease, anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice.
In high-risk stable atherosclerotic vascular disease patients without AF, combination therapy with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin provides some benefits on CVD events (including on stroke) even in the absence of associated AF, but at the risk of more major bleeding.
In the absence of AF, antiplatelet drugs are used for secondary stroke prevention for non-cardioembolic stroke with either aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Both the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin and ticagrelor and aspirin have been found to be superior to aspirin alone for 90-day treatment of acute minor strokes and high-risk TIAs. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has also been utilized for intracranial atherosclerotic ISs.

Better functional and psychological status requires care packages and management pathways to be established and implemented, including tailored rehabilitation and personalized appropriately to the patient's needs, both in hospital, during rehabilitation, and post-discharge. Assessment of PSD, anxiety, and cognitive impairment should be undertaken as part of post-stroke care, with appropriate intervention where required.

Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are common in stroke patients, and all need to be considered and addressed in a holistic manner, with treatment targets as per CVD prevention guidelines.

A considerable burden of previously unknown AF can be detected when long-term monitoring is applied in at-risk patients.

Across the stroke continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease with prior antiplatelet therapy (APT) and new atrial fibrillation — among patients appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and currently receiving APT, the pathway separates three categories. For prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from the perspective of hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days following an acute event, and an OAC can typically be initiated immediately when TIA is the diagnosis without infarct or hemorrhage on imaging. For recent carotid endarterectomy, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from risk of post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an OAC (DOAC preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after carotid stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or TIA — timing, bridging, and renal cautions are outlined as follows: "Patients should be treated (ie, bridged) with aspirin until anticoagulation has reached a therapeutic level", and "Before anticoagulation is initiated and during the time that anticoagulation is started but has not yet reached therapeutic levels (INR < 2.0), treatment with aspirin is recommended". Timing statements include "Oral anticoagulation should generally be initiated within 1 to 2 weeks after stroke onset" and "We therefore recommend initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy within 2 weeks of a cardioembolic stroke; however, for patients with large infarcts or other risk factors for hemorrhage, additional delays are appropriate", with "Earlier anticoagulation can be considered for patients at low risk of bleeding complications" and "Delaying anticoagulation should be considered for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic complications". For dabigatran, renal safety is specified: "Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less)".

Atrial fibrillation with prior ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease — adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation: For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, the usefulness of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants is uncertain for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Unstable angina and coronary artery stenting represent special circumstances in which management may warrant dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation.

### What to do after the bleed: resuming anticoagulation after major bleeding [^115ueJyW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Resuming anticoagulation therapy after a potentially life-threatening bleeding complication evokes high anxiety levels among clinicians and patients trying to decide whether resuming oral anticoagulation to prevent devastating and potentially fatal thromboembolic events or discontinuing anticoagulation in hopes of reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding is best. The available evidence favors resumption of anticoagulation therapy for gastrointestinal tract bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage survivors, and it is reasonable to begin postbleeding decision making with resuming anticoagulation therapy as the default plan. After considering factors related to the index bleeding event, the underlying thromboembolic risk, and comorbid conditions, a decision to accept or modify the default plan can be made in collaboration with other care team members, the patient, and their caregivers. Although additional information is needed regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption, available evidence indicates that waiting ∼14 days may best balance the risk of recurrent bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality after gastrointestinal tract bleeding. When to resume anticoagulation after intracranial hemorrhage is less clear, but most studies indicate that resumption within the first month of discharge is associated with better outcomes.

Knowledge gaps and future research — antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): In addition to the uncertainty of risk and benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF and ICH, there is limited evidence for individual selection of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients for whom anticoagulation will be restarted, and ongoing trials and future studies with stratification based on ICH location, mechanism, and risk factors for recurrence may lead to more informative decisions. Most analyses evaluating the role of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with ICH have focused on recurrent events, and future studies that incorporate outcomes such as disability or quality of life in addition to clinical events may provide information that is more patient-centric.

### Limitations of transoesophageal echocardiogram in acute ischaemic stroke [^115ji4kB]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 185 subjects hospitalised with confirmed AIS who underwent a TOE, only 7 (4%) experienced a change in management, as defined as the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, antibiotic therapy or PFO closure as a direct result of TOE findings. The majority (63%) of patients initiated on OAC were started based on the findings from routine, less invasive and more cost-effective testing such as telemetry, TTE and carotid ultrasound.

As it relates to CVA, TOE is more sensitive to assess for valvular vegetations, left atrial appendage thrombus and PFO than is TTE. Multiple studies have investigated the role of TOE in the work up for stroke and have mixed conclusions and recommendations. In spite of these studies, previous guidelines remained vague with respect to the proper use of TOE, and there are limited observational data showing how TOE findings impact management. Furthermore, the rates of TOE findings causing a change in management vary across studies. For example, Pallesen and colleagues and Katsanos and colleagues showed 9% of cases resulted in management change, while Marino and colleagues revealed that, despite having high diagnostic value, TOE findings changed medical management in only 0.4% of cases in their study. Hence, our result of 4% is intermediary. The AHA/ASA 2018 updated guidelines for AIS deviate from prior iterations by directly addressing cardiac work up in stroke, acknowledging the role of prolonged cardiac monitoring, with a IIb recommendation in 'select patients'. In addition, and in line with our findings, 'the routine use of echocardiography in all patients with acute ischaemic stroke to plan subsequent secondary preventive treatment is not cost-effective and is not recommended'. The American Society for Echocardiography (ASE) published guidelines in 2011 for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of cardiac source of embolism. The indications include having a non-diagnostic TTE, evaluating for cardiovascular source of embolus without other non-cardiac source, to assess valvular structure and to diagnose infective endocarditis. Significant valvular structural problems that pose a risk for thromboembolic phenomenon should be detectable by TTE. In addition, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (a separate indication for TOE) should be accompanied by consistent clinical findings. The ASE guidelines state that the use of TOE is 'inappropriate and not reasonable' when TOE results would not change management.

Antiphospholipid syndrome after unprovoked venous thrombosis — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) strategy: Recurrence rates without VKA therapy are high, so anticoagulation should be continued lifelong. Higher-intensity warfarin showed no added efficacy over a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3; targets of 3 to 4 (versus 2–3) did not add benefit, and high-intensity warfarin was associated with a nonstatistically increased bleeding risk (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 0.92–5.15]). When compared with aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 has been shown to be effective.

### Anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke [^111vKaDj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of early death worldwide. Most ischaemic strokes are caused by a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Patient outcomes might be improved if they are offered anticoagulants that reduce their risk of developing new blood clots and do not increase the risk of bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1995, with updates in 2004, 2008, and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of early anticoagulation (within the first 14 days of onset) for people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke. Our hypotheses were that, compared with a policy of avoiding their use, early anticoagulation would be associated with:

- reduced risk of death or dependence in activities of daily living a few months after stroke onset;
- reduced risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke;
- increased risk of symptomatic intracranial and extracranial haemorrhage; and
- reduced risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2021); the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 7), in the Cochrane Library (searched 5 August 2021); MEDLINE (2014 to 5 August 2021); and Embase (2014 to 5 August 2021). In addition, we searched ongoing trials registries and reference lists of relevant papers. For previous versions of this review, we searched the register of the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration, consulted MedStrategy (1995), and contacted relevant drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing early anticoagulant therapy (started within two weeks of stroke onset) with control in people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using RoB1 and GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 28 trials involving 24,025 participants. Quality of the trials varied considerably. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, or reporting bias. Anticoagulants tested were standard unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants, and thrombin inhibitors. Over 90% of the evidence is related to effects of anticoagulant therapy initiated within the first 48 hours of onset. No evidence suggests that early anticoagulation reduced the odds of death or dependence at the end of follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 12 RCTs, 22,428 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found no evidence suggesting that anticoagulant therapy started within the first 14 days of stroke onset reduced the odds of death from all causes (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.09; 22 RCTs, 22,602 participants; low-certainty evidence) during the treatment period. Although early anticoagulant therapy was associated with fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; 12 RCTs, 21,665 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), it was also associated with an increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.90 to 3.21; 20 RCTs, 23,221 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, early anticoagulation reduced the frequency of symptomatic pulmonary emboli (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81; 14 RCTs, 22,544 participants; high-certainty evidence), but this benefit was offset by an increase in extracranial haemorrhage (OR 2.99, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.99; 18 RCTs, 22,255 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, four new relevant studies have been published, and conclusions remain consistent. People who have early anticoagulant therapy after acute ischaemic stroke do not demonstrate any net short- or long-term benefit. Treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism but increased bleeding risk. Data do not support the routine use of any of the currently available anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke.

Hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke — impact on anticoagulation timing: Hemorrhagic transformation is often seen as a contraindication to early (< 2 weeks of stroke onset) oral anticoagulation, although no randomized trial has been done that directly addresses the question. In a multicenter, prospective international study of consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation that included a second CT 24 to 72 hours after stroke onset, the presence of hemorrhagic transformation led to an average delay in anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — timing to start or resume anticoagulation: A study suggests that a composite net benefit of stroke risk reduction and bleeding risk minimization occurs when anticoagulation is started 7 to 8 weeks after ICH. Before 4 to 8 weeks, there appears to be a significant increase in bleeding risk, and these studies suggest that the optimal timing of initiation of anticoagulation is ≈8 weeks after the index ICH. Therefore, timing should be considered on a case-by-case basis of individual risk assessments of thromboembolism, recurrent ICH, and late ICH expansion.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of cerebrovascular disease (CVD): For prior TIA or cerebrovascular accident with VTE requiring AC, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days after the acute event; given that TIA has no infarct or hemorrhage on imaging, an AC can typically be initiated immediately. After recent carotid endarterectomy, stop all APT and treat with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an AC (DOAC preferred); once the standard DAPT duration has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone.

### Ischaemic stroke in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^112ZyDkg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation substantially reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, recent studies have shown that up to 22%-36% of patients on anticoagulation will suffer an ischaemic stroke (IS). In this narrative review, we provide an overview of risk factors, mechanisms, management of acute IS and strategies for secondary prevention for patients with AF with stroke despite oral anticoagulation. For this paper, we reviewed available literature from important studies (randomised clinical trials, meta-analyses, reviews and case series) on patients with IS despite anticoagulation. We focused on recent studies that examined safety and efficacy of acute stroke treatments and evaluation and management strategies for secondary prevention. The literature review suggests that patients with AF with IS despite anticoagulation are a heterogeneous group with several possible mechanisms, which may include reduced or non-adherence to anticoagulation, competing non-cardioembolic stroke aetiologies or cardioembolic mechanisms separate from AF. The identification of one or more possible mechanisms of stroke despite anticoagulation may allow for a more targeted and individualised approach for secondary prevention. There are limited data to guide management in such patients, and strategies to prevent recurrent strokes include strict risk factor control and therapies targeting the most likely stroke mechanism. In cases where AF is suspected to be the culprit, clinical trials are needed to test the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion plus anticoagulation versus continued anticoagulation alone.

### Anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke [^114WrqPT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most ischaemic strokes are caused by a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Clot prevention with anticoagulants might improve outcomes if bleeding risks are low. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, with recent updates in 2004 and 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of early anticoagulation (within the first 14 days of onset) in people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library 2014 Issue 6), MEDLINE (2008 to June 2014) and EMBASE (2008 to June 2014). In addition, we searched ongoing trials registries and reference lists of relevant papers. For previous versions of this review, we searched the register of the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration, consulted MedStrategy (1995), and contacted relevant drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing early anticoagulant therapy (started within two weeks of stroke onset) with control in people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included 24 trials involving 23,748 participants. The quality of the trials varied considerably. The anticoagulants tested were standard unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants, and thrombin inhibitors. Over 90% of the evidence relates to the effects of anticoagulant therapy initiated within the first 48 hours of onset. Based on 11 trials (22,776 participants) there was no evidence that anticoagulant therapy started within the first 14 days of stroke onset reduced the odds of death from all causes (odds ratio (OR) 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.12) at the end of follow-up. Similarly, based on eight trials (22,125 participants), there was no evidence that early anticoagulation reduced the odds of being dead or dependent at the end of follow-up (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04). Although early anticoagulant therapy was associated with fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88), it was also associated with an increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.95 to 3.33). Similarly, early anticoagulation reduced the frequency of symptomatic pulmonary emboli (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81), but this benefit was offset by an increase in extracranial haemorrhages (OR 2.99; 95% CI 2.24 to 3.99).

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of the review, no new relevant studies have been published and so there is no additional information to change the conclusions. Early anticoagulant therapy is not associated with net short- or long-term benefit in people with acute ischaemic stroke. Treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but increased bleeding risk. The data do not support the routine use of any of the currently available anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke.

American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) perioperative antiplatelet and anticoagulant management — guideline scope and methods state a review of the literature and development of consensus-based guidelines based on best evidence synthesis for patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional procedures. The objective is to provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding assessment of bleeding and thrombosis risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications. Methods included review of the literature on bleeding risks during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns, and perioperative management, with a multidisciplinary panel of experts developing methodology, risk stratification based on best evidence synthesis, and management, and addressing the risk of cessation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy based on a multitude of factors. Data sources included bleeding risk, practice patterns, risk of thrombosis, and perioperative management, with relevant literature identified through searches of multiple databases from 1966 through 2023, and a modified Delphi technique was used to minimize bias related to group interactions. Clinical context notes that anticoagulants and antiplatelets target the clotting system, increasing the bleeding risk, while discontinuation exposes patients to thrombosis risk that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease.

### Collaboration on the optimal timing of anticoagulation after ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and prospective individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (CATALYST) [^117VLExR]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of oral anticoagulation for prevention of early ischaemic stroke recurrence in people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation remains uncertain. We aimed to estimate the effects of starting a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) early (≤ 4 days) versus later (≥ 5 days) after onset of ischaemic stroke.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase for randomised controlled trials published from inception until March 16, 2025. We included clinical trials if they were pre-registered, randomised, investigated clinical outcomes, and included participants with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation who were assigned to either early or later initiation (≤ 4 days vs ≥ 5 days) of a DOAC in approved doses. The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes included components of the primary composite within 30 days and 90 days. We did a one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis with the use of a generalised linear mixed-effects model, accounting for between-trial differences, to generate treatment effects, which are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024522634.

Findings

We identified four eligible trials: TIMING (NCT02961348), ELAN (NCT03148457), OPTIMAS (NCT03759938), and START (NCT03021928). After excluding participants who opted out of data sharing or were not randomly assigned to DOAC initiation within 4 days or at day 5 or later, we included 5441 participants (mean age 77.7 years [SD 10.0], 2472 [45.4%] women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5 [IQR 3–10]) in the individual patient data meta-analysis. We obtained primary outcome data for 5429 participants. The primary outcome occurred in 57 (2.1%) of 2683 participants who started DOAC early versus 83 (3.0%) of 2746 participants who started later (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50–0.98, p = 0.039). Early DOAC reduced the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke (45 [1.7%] of 2683 vs 70 [2.6%] of 2746, OR 0.66, 0.45–0.96, p = 0.029). There was no evidence of an increase in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage with early DOAC initiation (10 [0.4%] of 2683 vs 10 [0.4%] of 2746, OR 1.02, 0.43–2.46, p = 0.96).

Interpretation

For people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation, early DOAC initiation (within 4 days) reduced the risk of the composite outcome of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^1137yqgL]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists

Over the decades, VKA have been the mainstay for anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (A-fib). A dose-response relationship between bleeding complications and supra-therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels has been documented with a sharp incidence increase for INR levels above 4. Nevertheless, ICH occurs commonly at therapeutic INR levels exemplified by the largest available VKA-associated ICH cohort (n = 1176) reporting a median INR level of 2.8 with an interquartile range between 2.3 and 3.5. While DOACs are currently replacing VKA as the primary drug in A-fib-patients, VKA remains the primary anticoagulant for several patient populations with high thromboembolic risk. Current American and International Guidelines for the management of ICH patients do not provide specific recommendations on how to treat VKA-associated ICH in terms of a specific reversal strategy. Particularly, INR values representing full reversal, timing of reversal, and reversal agents to be used are not addressed. However, guidelines are currently being revised as several high-quality publications have substantially added knowledge to the field.

Recommendations

For patients with non-massive cerebral infarction and not from cardiogenic embolism and without other bleeding risks, anticoagulant therapy is recommended and to be initiated within 2 weeks (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For patients at high risk of bleeding, or large infarction area or poor blood pressure control, the timing of initiation of anticoagulation therapy should be extended beyond 2 weeks (class IIa, level of evidence B).
The size and severity of stroke should be taken into account when consider anticoagulation. It is suggested that anticoagulation can be initiated 1 day after TIA, 3 days after non-disabling small infarction and 6 days after moderate size infarction. Patients with large area infarction should wait at least 2–3 weeks (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For most patients with AIS with atrial fibrillation, it is reasonable to start oral anticoagulant therapy within 4–14 days after onset (class IIa, level of evidence B).

Drug selection

Recommendations

For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with atrial fibrillation (including paroxysmal), appropriate doses of warfarin are recommended to prevent the recurrence of thromboembolism. The target dose of warfarin is to maintain INR at 2.0–3.0 (class I, level of evidence A).
New oral anticoagulants can be used as an alternative to warfarin. New oral anticoagulants include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban (class I, level of evidence A). Individual factors should be taken into account in the selection of drugs.
Emergency anticoagulant therapy for patients with AIS is not recommended for the prevention of early recurrence of stroke, stop the deterioration of neurological function and improve the outcome of AIS (class III, level of evidence A).
The effectiveness of emergency anticoagulant therapy is unclear in patients with AIS with severe ipsilateral ICA stenosis (class IIb, level of evidence A).
For patients with AIS with extracranial intravascular non-occlusive thrombosis, the safety and efficacy of short-term anticoagulant therapy are unclear (class IIb, level of evidence C).

Despite anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, some patients still suffer an ischaemic stroke. The issue of whether to stop or continue warfarin, or possibly to reverse the anticoagulation is an area of uncertainty. Continued anticoagulation may, however, increase haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. In this article we review the published evidence in an attempt to quantify the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy and identify areas for further research.

Conclusion

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, and the list of other indications is expanding. There are many factors that will affect appropriate efficacy and safety end points when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios. Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs/symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality‐of‐life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant. Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers. As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### Using anticoagulation for stroke prevention… [^11714hFu]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Dose-adjusted warfarin reduces the risk for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by about 60 percent compared with placebo. This risk reduction is similar for primary and secondary prevention and for disabling and nondisabling strokes. Aspirin reduces the risk for nondisabling stroke by about 20 percent compared with placebo, and warfarin reduces the risk by about 40 percent compared with aspirin. Warfarin protection is maximized at an International Normalized Ratio between 2. 0 and 3.
0. An INR between 1. 6 and
2. 5 is also associated with substantial embolism protection — about 90 percent of that achieved with the higher-intensity levels. The target intensity of anticoagulation is a balance between prevention of stroke and an increased risk of major bleeding. Anticoagulation increases the frequency and severity of major intracranial and extracranial hemorrhage, predicted mostly by the intensity of anticoagulation and the patient age.

Therefore, in patients younger than 75 years and for secondary prevention, the target INR is 2. 5; for primary prevention in older patients, the target value is 2.
0. Combining low-dose warfarin with aspirin confers little protection compared with aspirin alone. Adding aspirin to higher-intensity warfarin therapy may increase the risk for intracranial hemorrhage in elderly patients and is less useful than increasing anticoagulation intensity in patients who sustain a cardioembolic event while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation. It is unclear, however, whether observations from TEE add to the predictive value of the clinical risk factors for stroke. TEE may help distinguish cardioembolic from noncardioembolic mechanisms. Dose-adjusted anticoagulation is recommended in all cases involving secondary prevention.

Risk factors for noncardioembolic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation include aortic arch plaque, disturbances of hemostasis and postmenopausal estrogen replacement. The authors conclude that dose-adjusted anticoagulation is highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin is modestly effective in reducing nondisabling, noncardioembolic strokes. Warfarin is more effective than aspirin alone, and low-intensity warfarin alone or in combination with aspirin offers little protection.

### Anticoagulation after cardioembolic stroke… [^115aCAiv]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with cardioembolic stroke admitted to our center from April 1, 2004, to June 30, 2006, and not treated with tissue plasminogen activator. Patients were grouped by treatment: no treatment, aspirin only, aspirin followed by warfarin sodium, intravenous heparin sodium in the acute phase followed by warfarin, and full-dose enoxaparin sodium combined with warfarin. Outcome measures and adverse events were collected prospectively. Laboratory values were captured from the records. There is no consensus on the best way to initiate AC after CES.

Because warfarin sodium takes several days to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio, 3 strategies are used during that period: warfarin alone or with aspirin; intravenous heparin sodium combined with warfarin; and full-dose enoxaparin sodium combined with warfarin. For analysis purposes, patients were assigned to 1 of 5 groups according to in-hospital treatment: no treatment; acetylsalicylic acid only; aspirin followed by warfarin; intravenous heparin in the acute phase followed by warfarin; and enoxaparin sodium combined with warfarin. The outcome distribution is shown in Table 3. Patients with AC were
2.

4 times more likely than their counterparts without AC to experience a favorable outcome. Although the NT and ASA groups had more severe strokes, these associations remained significant after controlling for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores and age using logistic regression. Our data showing no episodes of skin necrosis in the WAR group further support that. Currently, bridging patients to prevent skin necrosis when initiating warfarin in a maintenance dosage is not recommended by hematological guidelines unless the patient is known to have protein C deficiency. 8, 9.

### Optimal timing of oral anticoagulation initiation in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: a comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review [^112TZsiV]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF)-related acute ischaemic strokes (AIS) are frequently disabling or fatal. AF is associated with approximately one-third of all stroke events and a fivefold increased risk of stroke. AF is linked to a heightened risk of early AIS recurrence (up to 1.3% per day), particularly within 48 hours to 2 weeks. The risk of haemorrhagic transformation (HT), a potential complication of AIS, often occurs within the first few days after stroke onset is high, especially in the initial days following large cardioembolic stroke lesions and acute reperfusion therapy. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is linked to higher rates of mortality and morbidity and has been reported in 2–20% of patients. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy decreases AIS in patients with AF by 64% and decreases all-cause mortality by 24%. However, OAC treatment is initially withheld after admission to reduce the risk of HT. Despite evidence that early initiation of OAC may mitigate the risk of AIS recurrence, there are concerns regarding the increased risk of haemorrhagic complications, especially in studies that predominantly used vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin drugs. However, the newer class of medications, such as direct-acting oral anticoagulation (DOAC), has changed this landscape.

The lack of robust evidence supporting early OAC over late OAC, especially in studies from the pre-DOAC era, has caused variations in current guideline recommendations regarding the timing of anticoagulation initiation. The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore the effectiveness and safety of early versus late DOAC initiation for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF and AIS.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the management of large hemispheric infarction: a statement for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the German society for neuro-intensive care and emergency medicine [^114qyLwy]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Large hemispheric infarction (LHI) anticoagulation for cardioembolic or high thromboembolic risk emphasizes resumption but acknowledges uncertain timing: after LHI, anticoagulation should be reinitiated in patients with increased thromboembolic risk, such as those with atrial fibrillation (AF) or prosthetic valves. The best point in time for this re-initiation is highly controversial, and since studies on anticoagulation in LHI do not exist, conclusions must be extrapolated from the general ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage populations. In ischemic stroke with AF, the HAEST study demonstrated a stroke recurrence rate of 8.5% within 14 days even in spite of LMWH prophylaxis. In anticoagulated patients with ICH, guidelines for the re-initiation of anticoagulation range from 2 days to 4 weeks, and in patients with prosthetic valves where anticoagulation was withheld after ICH, thromboembolism occurred in 3% during the first 30 days.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most developed nations. There is a significant body of evidence supporting strategies that target primary and secondary stroke prevention. This evidence cannot be broadly applied to all patients, and each patient's situation and values must be considered with regard to shared evidence-based decision making. Several models can be used to apply evidence to individual patients, including formal clinical decision analysis, decision aids, or simpler tools such as the likelihood of being helped vs harmed. Various programmatic models of providing patient care in stroke prevention may also be useful; these include specialized clinics or disease-management programs, anticoagulation management services, and self-testing and management of anticoagulation by patients.

Additionally, recommendations regarding aspirin and/or direct oral anticoagulant therapy for individuals with decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction ≤ 35%-40%) and no atrial fibrillation (AF) or LV thrombus are provided. Based on evidence from the WARCEF (Warfarin vs Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction)and COMMANDER HF (A Study to Assess the Effectiveness and Safety of Rivaroxaban in Reducing the Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction or Stroke in Participants with Heart Failure and Coronary Artery Disease Following an Episode of Decompensated Heart Failure)trials, the 2024 Guideline does not recommend the use of anticoagulation among individuals with a reduced LV ejection fraction and no AF or LV thrombus due to an increased risk of major bleeding events (Class 3 recommendation, harm).

Although not directly addressed in the 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline, anticoagulation for primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke among individuals with AF is covered in the 2023 Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation Guideline. Among individuals with AF who have an annual risk of thromboembolic stroke ≥ 2% (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women), selection of anticoagulation is recommended to be based upon the annualized stroke rather than the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent).

It is important for clinicians to have shared decision-making conversations with patients about their individualized stroke and bleeding risk, particularly for patients at very high stroke risk but whom have no other clear indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

We recommend administration of Vitamin K to ensure durable reversal of INR following VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage; Vitamin K should be dosed as soon as possible or concurrently with other reversal agents, and we suggest one dose of Vitamin K 10 mg IV with subsequent treatment guided by follow-up INR. If repeat INR is still elevated ≥ 1.4 within the first 24–48 h after reversal agent administration, we suggest redosing with vitamin K 10 mg IV.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: a practical guide [^111JSYkD]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

### Is there a role for low-dose DOACs as prophylaxis? [^114aCyez]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have transformed the management of thrombotic disorders. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that DOACs can replace vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the 2 existing major indications for anticoagulation: the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation and the acute treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE); this literature is widely known. In this article, we will concentrate on the less well-discussed benefits of the use of DOACs-using low doses as primary and secondary prophylaxis in both venous and arterial thromboprophylaxis. The attractiveness of using a low-dose DOAC is that the bleeding risk seems to be slightly lower than with the standard dose and significantly lower than with VKAs so that they can be used safely for long periods, where previously, VKAs had risk/benefit ratios that did not permit this. We discuss in detail the extended use of low-dose DOACs in secondary VTE prevention. We also cover the utility of low-dose DOACs in the evolving fields of prevention of hospital-associated VTE in acutely ill medical patients, after total hip and knee replacement, and in cancer patients. To complete the indications, we briefly discuss the role of low-dose DOACs in the secondary prevention of arterial vascular events.

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^1125drbR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

In closing, the interrelationship between ischaemic stroke and cancer is a complex one. As the life expectancy of the general population increases and the survival rate of patients with cancer improves, the coexistence of stroke and cancer in adult patients will continue to be common. This report seeks to highlight the intricacies of this correlation. It emphasises the relevance of establishing a distinct stroke aetiology on a patient-by-patient basis, especially when active malignancy is present. This, in turn, can have important implications for the prognosis, therapeutic management and prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cancer.

Learning points

Clinicians should remain alert for thromboembolic events (both arterial and venous) in patients with cancer as a possible cause of any clinical deterioration. Even though their risk is significantly increased with advanced cancer, delay in diagnosis is not uncommon and may negatively impact patient morbidity and mortality.
Identifying stroke aetiology in the setting of malignancy can be complex due to the presence of traditional cerebrovascular risk factors in many adult oncology patients, but this is crucial to defining treatment and prevention strategies.
Some studies have associated elevated D-dimer levels with a high risk of early recurrent ischaemic strokes in patients with cancer. Thus, it can be beneficial to consider D-dimer levels for risk stratification of recurrent events as part of the acute inpatient stroke management of certain patients with active cancer.
There are no current recommendations to support any benefit of early anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention after acute stroke in patients with cancer. However, it should be considered if cancer-associated hypercoagulability is likely to be the main stroke aetiology.

Antithrombotic therapy is a key element of secondary prevention in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, its use in clinical practice is not always straightforward. This review provides an update on certain difficult scenarios in antithrombotic management, with a focus on recent clinical trials and large observational studies. We discuss the approach to patients with an indication for antithrombotic treatment who also have clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding, patients with indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment, and patients in whom antithrombotic treatment fails to prevent stroke. We also review the timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke, and the use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease. Despite a wealth of new evidence, numerous uncertainties remain and we highlight ongoing trials addressing these.

Recommendations

For patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with atrial fibrillation, the time of anticoagulation should be chosen according to the severity of ischaemia and the risk of bleeding transformation. It is suggested that anticoagulation therapy should be given within 14 days after the onset of neurological symptoms to prevent stroke recurrence. For patients with high risk of bleeding, the timing of starting anticoagulation should be appropriately prolonged (class IIa, level of evidence B).
If patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with atrial fibrillation are unable to receive oral anticoagulant therapy, aspirin alone may be considered for treatment (class IIa, level of evidence B). Aspirin combined with clopidogrel should be carefully selected as the choice of antiplatelet therapy (class IIb, level of evidence B).

Atherothrombosis is a systemic disease that often involves the coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial circulations. The presence of multiple risk factors, even in asymptomatic patients, greatly increases the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Antiplatelet therapy potentially has a valuable role across the full spectrum of atherothrombotic disorders. The role of aspirin is well established, and the benefits of clopidogrel have been demonstrated in clinical trials. The Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial is currently under way to determine whether the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin is superior to aspirin plus placebo in > 15,000 patients with stable atherothrombosis. The results of the CHARISMA trial are expected to provide further information on the optimal management of patients with stable atherothrombosis with respect to both antiplatelet therapy and overall management.

More frequently (1–10% of cases) patients may develop an acute PE following a stroke.PE is the most common cause of death 2–4 weeks post stroke. In the absence of anticoagulation, the majority of haemorrhagic transformation involves petechial bleeds with low risk of mass effect. However, low and intermediate dose heparin early after stroke presentation is associated with an increased rate of haemorrhagic transformation. Stroke guidelines advise delaying anticoagulation for 2 weeks post ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but give discordant advice regarding anticoagulation for coexisting PE. UK stroke guidance suggests anticoagulation for proximal DVT or PE while AHA guidelines do not recommend initial anticoagulation in patients with moderate to severe stroke.

Suggested approach: The risk–benefit ratio for individual patients should be assessed; however, our general approach is to anticoagulate all patients with a cerebral infarct and PE. In patients with PE with a primary haemorrhagic stroke or recent significant haemorrhagic transformation we would consider inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion and delayed anticoagulation.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115YUQ62]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The frequency of performance of interventional techniques in chronic pain patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy continues to increase. Understanding the importance of continuing chronic anticoagulant therapy, the need for interventional techniques, and determining the duration and discontinuation or temporary suspension of anticoagulation is crucial to avoiding devastating complications, primarily when neuraxial procedures are performed. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets target the clotting system, increasing the bleeding risk. However, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs exposes patients to thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. These guidelines summarize the current peer reviewed literature and develop consensus-based guidelines based on the best evidence synthesis for patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional procedures.

Study Design

Review of the literature and development of guidelines based on best evidence synthesis.

Objectives

To provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding the assessment of bleeding and thrombosis risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications.

Methods

Development of consensus guidelines based on best evidence synthesis included review of the literature on bleeding risks during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns, and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. A multidisciplinary panel of experts developed methodology, risk stratification based on best evidence synthesis, and management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. It also included risk of cessation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy based on a multitude of factors. Multiple data sources on bleeding risk, practice patterns, risk of thrombosis, and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy were identified. The relevant literature was identified through searches of multiple databases from 1966 through 2023. In the development of consensus statements and guidelines, we used a modified Delphi technique, which has been described to minimize bias related to group interactions. Panelists without a primary conflict of interest voted on approving specific guideline statements. Each panelist could suggest edits to the guideline statement wording and could suggest additional qualifying remarks or comments as to the implementation of the guideline in clinical practice to achieve consensus and for inclusion in the final guidelines, each guideline statement required at least 80% agreement among eligible panel members without primary conflict of interest.

Results

A total of 34 authors participated in the development of these guidelines. Of these, 29 participated in the voting process. A total of 20 recommendations were developed. Overall, 100% acceptance was obtained for 16 of 20 items. Total items were reduced to 18 with second and third round voting. The final results were 100% acceptance for 16 items (89%). There was disagreement for 2 statements (statements 6 and 7) and recommendations by 3 authors. These remaining 2 items had an acceptance of 94% and 89%. The disagreement and dissent were by Byron J. Schneider, MD, with recommendation that all transforaminals be classified into low risk, whereas Sanjeeva Gupta, MD, desired all transforaminals to be in intermediate risk. The second disagreement was related to Vivekanand A. Manocha, MD, recommending that cervical and thoracic transforaminal to be high risk procedures. Thus, with appropriate literature review, consensus-based statements were developed for the perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants and antiplatelets These included the following: estimation of the thromboembolic risk, estimation of bleeding risk, and determination of the timing of restarting of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. Risk stratification was provided classifying the interventional techniques into three categories of low risk, moderate or intermediate risk, and high risk. Further, on multiple occasions in low risk and moderate or intermediate risk categories, recommendations were provided against cessation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

Limitations

The continued paucity of literature with discordant recommendations.

Conclusion

Based on the review of available literature, published clinical guidelines, and recommendations, a multidisciplinary panel of experts presented guidelines in managing interventional techniques in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period. These guidelines provide a comprehensive assessment of classification of risk, appropriate recommendations, and recommendations based on the best available evidence.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^113aUNyF]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

A: Appropriate antithrombotic therapy

The 'A' criterion ('Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy') in the post-stroke patient refers to the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs), either as a non-vitamin K antagonist OAC (also called a direct OAC or DOAC) or well-managed vitamin K antagonist (VKA, e.g. warfarin) with a time in therapeutic range ≥ 70% when AF is present or a VKA, if a prosthetic mechanical heart valve is present. Where there is associated atherosclerotic vascular disease and no AF or mechanical valve present, the appropriate use of antiplatelet therapy is needed. A balance is needed between preventing recurrent ischaemic or thrombotic events and major bleeding, which is even more challenging if both AF and vascular disease, whether coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery disease, are present. In such patients (ie. AF with stable vascular disease), anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice as thromboprphylaxis, although many physicians would still prescribe combination therapy, despite the paucity of evidence from large randomized trials. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, for example, the pooled prevalence of carotid stenosis in AF patients was 12.4% (95% CI 8.7 to 16.0), ranging from 4.4 to 24.3%. In AF patients with coronary artery disease, appropriate antithrombotic therapy management varies according the clinical scenario.

When the AF patient has 'stable vascular disease', the patient should be managed with OAC monotherapy. In the AFIRE trial, combination therapy with OAC plus antiplatelets was associated with worse thromboembolic and bleeding outcomes in AF patients with stable coronary disease. In AF patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a balance between AF-related stroke prevention which requires OAC and reducing cardiac ischaemia in an ACS presentation which requires antiplatelet therapy needs to be reached; to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis after a percutaneous coronary intervention and the risk of bleeding by the combination of OAC with antiplatelet therapy. In patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis and AF, carotid endarterectomy is commonly considered, or, in those less suitable for surgery, carotid artery stenting may be chosennotwithstanding the need for a short course of combined antithrombotic therapy after stenting. While more data are needed to inform optimal antithrombotic management in this setting, a recent nationwide observational evidence suggested that OAC therapy alone could be a default treatment for most of these patients, combined with a short period single antiplatelet therapy in those at high risk of a recurrent vascular event.

Recommendations

In patients with no left ventricular mural thrombus, but with akinesis or dyskinesis of the anterior wall, oral anticoagulation therapy of warfarin for 3 months should be considered (target INR value = 2.5, range 2.0–3.0) (class IIa, level of evidence B).
If there is no left ventricular mural thrombus, but no movement or abnormal movement of the anterior wall is found, oral anticoagulation therapy of warfarin for 3 months should also be considered (target INR value = 2.5, range 2.0–3.0) (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation and other risk factors, such as carotid stenosis, oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is recommended (target INR = 2.5, range 2.0–3.0) (class IIa, level of evidence B).
Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease who have been treated with warfarin, routinely combining with antiplatelet therapy after ischaemic stroke or TIA is not recommended (class III, level of evidence C). However, aspirin antiplatelet therapy can be added when ischaemic stroke or TIA still occurs during the treatment of sufficient amount of warfarin (class IIa, level of evidence B).
Patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with non-rheumatic mitral valve disease or other valve diseases (local aortic arch, mitral annulus calcification, mitral valve prolapse, etc) without atrial fibrillation may consider antiplatelet therapy (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA and mechanical artificial heart valve, long-term warfarin oral anticoagulation therapy is recommended (INR 2/5–3.5) (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For patients with previous history of ischaemic stroke or TIA and mechanical artificial heart valves, if the risk of bleeding is low, aspirin can be used in addition to warfarin anticoagulation (class IIa, level of evidence B).
It is suggested that any decision on PFO closure should be made jointly by neurologists and cardiologists (class I, level of evidence A).
Before PFO closure, other known causes of ischaemic stroke (including monitoring arrhythmias) should be carefully excluded. The possibility of PFO correlation with the stroke, risk factors and lifestyle changes should be assessed. And communication between patients and multidisciplinary clinical teams should be involved in making the decision. For ischaemic stroke caused by PFO, PFO closure can be performed to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence (class I, level of evidence A).

### Antithrombotic treatment for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a European Stroke Organisation guideline [^115wFFni]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation have a high risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations on antithrombotic medication for secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular outcomes in these patients. The working group identified questions and outcomes, graded evidence, and developed recommendations according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure for guidelines. The guideline was reviewed and approved by the ESO guideline board and the ESO executive committee. In patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of recurrence over antiplatelets or no antithrombotic treatment. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are preferred over vitamin K antagonists because they have a lower risk of major bleeding and death. Recommendations are weak regarding timing of treatment, (re-)starting oral anticoagulants in patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage, and treatment in specific patient subgroups of those of older age, with cognitive impairment, renal failure or small vessel disease, because of a lack of strong evidence. In conclusion, for patients with atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke or thromboembolism. Further research is required to determine the best timing for initiating oral anticoagulants after an acute ischemic stroke, whether or not oral anticoagulants should be (re)started in patients with a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, and the best secondary preventive treatment in specific subgroups.

### Treatment for blunt cerebrovascular injuries: equivalence of anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents… [^115beZiZ]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Setting Level I trauma center. Patients Patients with BCVIs from January 1, 1997, to January 1, 2007. Main Outcome Measures Incidence of cerebrovascular accident, stratified by treatment. Results. Treatment was initiated for 282 asymptomatic BCVIs; 1 patient had a CVA. Of 107 patients with untreated, asymptomatic BCVIs, 23 had a CVA. Conclusions With an overall CVA risk of 21% and a documented latent period, comprehensive screening, early diagnosis, and institution of antithrombotic therapy for BCVI are clearly warranted. The type of treatment, heparin vs antiplatelet agents, does not appear to affect either stroke risk or injury healing rates. For BCVI overall, there was stability in injury grade on the second angiogram in 160 grade I injuries, 44 grade II injuries, and 55 grade III injuries.

On 10-day follow-up imaging for those patients undergoing therapeutic treatment, injury healing rates for all BCVIs were 46% for aspirin and/or clopidogrel, 43% for aspirin, and 39% for heparin. To date, multiple studies suggest that early antithrombotic therapy in asymptomatic patients with BCVI reduces or nearly eliminates BCVI-related strokes. 1–15 Miller et al8 found a reduction in stroke rate for CAIs from 64% in untreated patients to 6. 8% in patients treated with antithrombotic therapy, and, for VAIs, a reduction from 54% to
2. 6% in treated patients. The present study, including 422 BCVIs, corroborates these findings. Patients treated with antithrombotic agents had a stroke rate of 0. 5%. Of interest, both types of treatment, anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, were effective in preventing stroke, and only 1 patient had a stroke while receiving systemic heparin.

However, there is a difference in the number of patients treated with each modality; almost twice as many BCVIs were treated with anticoagulation compared with antiplatelet agents. This difference is likely for 2 reasons.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112BkxQD]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage — initial management emphasizes prompt discontinuation and reversal: In patients with anticoagulant-associated spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), anticoagulation should be discontinued immediately and rapid reversal of anticoagulation should be performed as soon as possible after diagnosis to improve survival (1 C-LD). Management requires emergency reversal of anticoagulation, and protocols and processes of care should be in place. In general, treatment should be administered when clinically significant anticoagulant levels are suspected on the basis of type and timing of anticoagulant dosing rather than waiting for results of blood tests. The risk of HE, rapid deterioration, and poor outcome is increased in patients with ICH on anticoagulation therapy.

Antiphospholipid syndrome secondary prevention — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): In an open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT), "rivaroxaban was associated with higher risk of thrombotic events", and "a similar result in favor of VKA over rivaroxaban was reported in an open-label RCT of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome". Observational data "also suggest a high risk of recurrent thrombosis among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who receive DOACs", and the guideline states "we do not recommend the use of DOACs in general and, specifically, rivaroxaban for antiphospholipid syndrome". There is also "a knowledge gap with respect to the role of dual antiplatelets in antiphospholipid syndrome", and "the absence of definitive data prevents us from providing a stronger recommendation at this point".

### Anticoagulation strategies following breakthrough ischemic stroke while on direct anticoagulants: a meta-analysis [^114tst6X]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The management of anticoagulation after ischemic stroke while on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is controversial. We performed an aggregate-data meta-analysis to compare anticoagulation strategies against each other to define the effect of switch to warfarin, switch to another DOAC, change in dosage, and add-on antiplatelet for the prevention of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), any stroke, and mortality.

Methods

The study protocol was deposited with PROSPERO (CRD42025639057). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library-all studies reporting on anticoagulation strategies after a stroke while on DOAC up to January 31, 2025. We included randomized controlled clinical studies and cohort studies with sample size ≥ 50 that (1) enrolled adult patients who experienced ischemic stroke while on DOACs, (2) assessed modifications to anticoagulation therapy, and (3) reported on at least one of the outcomes. Main outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke; secondary outcomes were ICH, all-cause mortality, and any stroke. We pooled estimates by random-effects modelling, reporting risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs comparing anticoagulation strategies against each other.

Results

We retrieved 2,171 results, with 8 observational studies reaching quantitative synthesis (n = 14,307 patients, mean age = 75 years, 48% female). Switching to warfarin was associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke compared with keeping the same DOAC (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42–2.29, I² = 0%, n studies = 5) or changing DOAC dosage (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.20–2.45, I² = 0%, n studies = 4). Switching to warfarin was also associated with higher ICH rates compared with keeping the same DOAC (RR 2.90, 95% CI 2.01–4.18, I² = 0%, n studies = 5) and DOAC-to-DOAC switch (RR 3.25, 95% CI 2.13–4.96, I² = 0%; n studies = 5). Keeping the same DOAC and switching to another DOAC, independently from mechanism, had similar rates of primary and secondary outcomes.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis indicates that switching to warfarin after a stroke while on DOAC seems less effective and safe in stroke recurrence prevention, ICH, and mortality compared with DOAC-based strategies.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Prevention of embolic strokes: the role of the American College of Chest Physicians [^1141Saiy]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) face an annual stroke risk of about 5%. Evidence that anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke has evolved over the 20th century. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has played a critical role in presenting guidelines for stroke prevention in AF. This commentary highlights the role that the ACCP guidelines have played, from their inception to the ninth edition. The first ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy in 1986 developed evidence-based guidelines for the indications, dosage, and monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. The conference recommended that anticoagulants be monitored by the international normalized ratio, and the appropriate dosage was to increase the international normalized ratio to two to three times control. This recommendation was widely accepted. Anticoagulants were recommended for AF with mitral valve disease and for nonvalvular AF with a history of embolism. No recommendations were made for nonvalvular AF without a history of embolism. These recommendations stimulated numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). By the third ACCP conference in 1992, RCTs had demonstrated a dramatic 69% stroke reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF. The third ACCP conference was the first to strongly recommend anticoagulation for primary and secondary stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF. ACCP conferences since 1992 have refined recommendations for nonvalvular AF on the basis of associated risk factors. The most recent conference, in 2011, recommended a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, rather than warfarin as the anticoagulant of choice. These ACCP guidelines have played a critical role in changing physicians' practice patterns. In 1980 only 7% of patients with AF in the United States received OA; by 2007, this had increased to 57%.
