## Question

A neonate presents with generalized cutis laxa, progeroid facies, corneal clouding, and developmental delay. Genetic evaluation confirms De Barsy syndrome. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing this diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be used for billing a neonate with confirmed De Barsy syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether De Barsy syndrome has a specific ICD-10 code or if it must be captured under a broader category. Then, I should verify the most appropriate ICD-10-CM category for congenital malformation syndromes. Next, I will check for any more specific subcodes that might apply, including those for connective tissue or progeroid syndromes. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with coding conventions and any available authoritative mappings or precedents for rare syndromes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its coding implications. De Barsy syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by cutis laxa, progeroid facies, corneal clouding, and developmental delay; importantly, it is a recognized rare disease, and rare diseases often lack dedicated ICD-10-CM codes, necessitating use of broader congenital anomaly or syndrome categories [^002c6fbb] [^4008fea7].

> Wait, let me verify whether a specific ICD-10-CM code exists for De Barsy syndrome. I should double-check the provided materials and typical coding references; I do not see a unique ICD-10-CM code explicitly labeled for De Barsy syndrome, which aligns with the broader observation that many rare genetic syndromes are not individually coded in ICD-10-CM and must be captured under umbrella categories such as "other specified congenital malformation syndromes" or similar groupings [^4008fea7] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the most appropriate ICD-10-CM chapter and block. Given that De Barsy syndrome is a congenital syndrome with multisystem involvement, the correct chapter is XVII (Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities), and the relevant block is Q87, which covers other specified congenital malformation syndromes, notably affecting the face and neck, limbs, and other systems; this is where syndromes like Treacher Collins (Q75.4) and other craniofacial/ectodermal syndromes are coded, supporting the use of Q87 for De Barsy syndrome [^notfound] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the most specific subcode within Q87. The most granular available code that fits a multisystem congenital syndrome not elsewhere classified is Q87.8, "Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified"; this is the standard catch-all for rare syndromes that do not have a dedicated ICD-10-CM code, and it is consistent with how other rare genetic syndromes are handled in administrative coding [^b8ef51ff] [^2c6ff3f4].

> But wait, what if there is a more specific connective tissue or progeroid subcategory I should use instead? Let me consider alternatives. I initially thought Q82.3 (congenital ectodermal dysplasia) might apply because of the cutis laxa, but that would be incorrect since De Barsy is not classified as an ectodermal dysplasia; likewise, Q84 (other congenital malformations of hair and skin) is too narrow and does not capture the multisystem syndrome nature. Therefore, Q87.8 remains the most accurate choice among available ICD-10-CM codes for De Barsy syndrome [^b8ef51ff] [^889daa20].

> I should confirm the final code and ensure formatting is correct. The ICD-10-CM code to use for confirmed De Barsy syndrome is Q87.8, with no additional characters required for this specific code, and it should be documented as "Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified", ideally with the syndrome name recorded in the clinical note to support medical necessity and future data retrieval [^b8ef51ff].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for De Barsy syndrome is **Q87.8** (Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified). This code captures the multisystem features of De Barsy syndrome, including cutis laxa, progeroid facies, corneal clouding, and developmental delay. Accurate documentation of the syndrome name and clinical features is essential to support medical necessity and ensure appropriate billing and care coordination.

---

## Clinical features of De Barsy syndrome

De Barsy syndrome is characterized by the following **clinical features**:

- **Generalized cutis laxa**: Loose, redundant skin with reduced elasticity.
- **Progeroid facies**: Premature aging appearance of the face.
- **Corneal clouding**: Opacity of the cornea, often leading to visual impairment.
- **Developmental delay**: Delayed motor and cognitive development.
- **Other features**: Joint hypermobility, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological involvement.

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for De Barsy syndrome

The ICD-10-CM code for De Barsy syndrome is **Q87.8**, defined as "Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified". This code is appropriate because De Barsy syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome with multisystem involvement that does not have a more specific ICD-10-CM code.

---

## Documentation requirements

To ensure accurate coding and billing, the following **documentation elements** are essential:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: Clearly document the diagnosis of De Barsy syndrome, including the results of genetic evaluation if available.
- **Clinical features**: Document the specific clinical features present, such as generalized cutis laxa, progeroid facies, corneal clouding, and developmental delay.
- **Medical necessity**: Provide evidence of medical necessity for diagnostic tests, treatments, and interventions related to the syndrome.

---

## Billing considerations

When billing for De Barsy syndrome, consider the following:

- **Primary diagnosis code**: Use Q87.8 as the primary diagnosis code for encounters specifically related to De Barsy syndrome.
- **Secondary diagnosis codes**: Use additional ICD-10-CM codes to document specific complications or comorbidities, such as corneal clouding (H18.9) or developmental delay (F88).
- **Insurance coverage**: Verify insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for rare genetic syndromes and related diagnostic tests and treatments.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for De Barsy syndrome is **Q87.8**. Accurate documentation of the diagnosis and clinical features is essential for appropriate billing, reimbursement, and care coordination.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^77d27c46]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^12e9dff6]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^0c3ce87b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^36a28412]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

The participating pain specialists perceived the clinical utility of the new classification as high and agreed with the utility judgements obtained in the formative field testing.

The participants also indicated that the ICD-11 classification of chronic pain offers a good coverage of chronic pain syndromes, again corroborating the results from the informal field testing. The majority believed the level of detail to be appropriate and reported few gaps and very few redundancies. The main areas in which a need for more detailed diagnoses was perceived were chronic neuropathic pain and chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain. Here, the frozen version meant that the coding reached only down to the levels of chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain, or chronic central or chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. This does not reflect the classification, but the granularity of the frozen version. At present, this is still the level to which the codes of the classification are visible in the ICD-11, although the level below, allowing for the relevant detail, has been included as index terms ("inclusion terms") and has been assigned uniform resource identifiers.

To sum up, the field test demonstrated that the classification of chronic pain in the ICD-11 improves clinical utility and thus fulfills a central aim of the ICD revision process,: The ICD-11 was easier to use and less ambiguous than the ICD-10 and reflected all relevant categories of chronic pain without redundancy. The descriptions in the foundation were published in a series of articles (for review see) meeting the WHO's aim of scientific evidence for the diagnoses entered. This predicts that not only in the field of pain medicine but also for chronic pain cases in primary care the ICD-11 will be easy to implement in clinical practice. Codes were easier to find in the ICD-11 browser than the ICD-10 browser. The excellent mapping of chronic pain syndromes onto clinically meaningful codes will improve the healthcare statistics and epidemiological studies and contribute to an improved visibility of chronic pain. This, in turn is expected to lead to research programs and advances in access to treatment benefitting millions of patients with chronic pain.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^8ad1f207]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Broad

The Broad cohort was intended to be the broadest cohort of patients. We defined this cohort as patients with a possible, probable, or definite ICD-9/10 code (excluding codes considered easy to diagnose, per the description above) or ≥ 1 curated genetic or non-genetic CPT/HCPCS code.

Conservative

The Conservative cohort was intended to be a specific cohort of patients with indicators of undiagnosed disease and evidence of genetic testing. We defined this cohort as patients with a possible or probable ICD-9/10 diagnosis code as the index code and ≥ 1 genetic test CPT/HCPCS code at any time. Thus, patients with definite ICD-9/10 codes as the index code were excluded.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### The continuing ophthalmic challenge of… [^2f163263]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, International Classification of Diseases 10 th Edition (ICD-10) codes describing Bartonella infections include Systemic Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.0); Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.1); Other Forms of Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44.8); Bartonellosis, Unspecified (ICD-10: A44.9); and the umbrella code Bartonellosis (ICD-10: A44). There also exists a code that is shared between the terms Parinaud's Conjunctivitis and Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome (ICD-10: H10.89).

The creation of additional ophthalmology-specific codes would increase diagnostic precision and facilitate consistent reporting of these conditions. We propose the creation of the following new ICD-10 codes: "Intraocular Bartonellosis", "Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis", and "Ocular Bartonellosis". The Intraocular Bartonellosis code should be assigned only when evidence of chorioretinitis, neuroretinitis, vitritis, or other intraocular findings have been confirmed. Conjunctival and Orbital Bartonellosis would capture the findings of the traditional term Parinaud's Oculoglandular Syndrome. Ocular Bartonellosis could serve as an umbrella diagnosis. Such diagnoses should be assigned only when laboratory-confirmed Bartonella infection has been established in the presence of the respective clinical findings or when the history and systemic symptoms strongly suggest Bartonella as the causative agent. These diagnostic codes should only be assigned when other diagnoses with similar possible presentations have been excluded or are highly unlikely. Using more precise terminology should help to determine the true incidence and prevalence of a disease that almost certainly is more common than generally assumed.

### Correlation of gestational age and age at death in sudden infant death syndrome: another pointer to the role of critical developmental period? [^b297b4b7]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data sources

The data for the study was obtained from the CDC database Birth Cohort Linked Birth – Infant Death Data Files. At the time of analysis, data were provided for years from 1983 to 2011 with a gap between 1992 and 1994. The data was deciphered based on the User's Guide manual.

Data harmonization

The contents of the source database was changing yearly, so the fields of interest were translated into a common format, for example days into weeks etc. The biggest problem was the change of the "cause of death" field, which used ICD codes in version 9 before 1999 and version 10 from then on. Although there is an official conversion guide between the two formats, the correspondence is ambiguous, being a many-to-many relationship, which is difficult to distinguish without specialist knowledge. To automate the process of unification of data, we created new codes of causes of death which were joining analogous codes from ICD-9 and ICD-10.

We extracted unique ICD9 and ICD10 codes from CDC data and treated them as nodes in a graph with paths if the codes were listed as equivalence based on Diagnosis Code Set General Equivalence Mappings ICD-10-CM to ICD-9-CM and ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM Documentation and User's Guide. From this graph, we extracted connected components and named them our new joined codes. Most of the created codes consisted of a few ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, which could be easily translated into more general categories like bacterial meningitis instead of listing the specific type of bacteria.

As a result of the data harmonization procedure, in this study, we operate not on distinct diseases but rather on groups of very similar (in terms of etiology) diseases. The list of groups and associated codes is in the supplementary material.

Data analysis

To minimize the influence of trends in SIDS diagnosis and changes in autopsy protocols on our analysis, we limited data to the years around the "Back to Sleep" campaign and divided these years into three categories: before (1986–1991), during (1995–1999) and after (2000–2005). During the analysis of death patterns of other causes than SIDS, we limited the analysis to causes that had more than 20 cases per year to exclude ultra-rare diseases which are difficult to describe statistically. All analysis and visualizations were made using Python 3.0 packages including SciPy, pandas, and seaborn.

### Rethinking the classification of mixed affective episodes in ICD-11 [^4a9b37ac]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Mixed affective episode is a prevalent mood disorder characterized by the coexistence or rapid alternation of manic and depressive symptoms, which is associated with significant suffering and high risk of suicide. Unfortunately, the current diagnostic classification of mixed affective episodes in the ICD-10 lacks a detailed definition with relevant subtypes. This inconsistency has significant negative implications for both research into the disorders in the bipolar spectrum and for clinical practice. For this reason there is a need for special attention on this diagnosis in the revisions of the diagnostic manuals. In this manuscript we suggest a set of clear diagnostic criteria and exhaustive subtypes for the mixed affective episodes aimed at the upcoming ICD-11. The defined syndrome and its subtypes are in close congruence with the suggested DSM-5 "mixed episode specifier", which is an advantage for common understanding and for research across the ICD/DSM border.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^3088a383]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

APC data repository

A large de-identified cohort (3504) of public and private hospital admissions was retrieved from the APC collection (2012–2017). Of this 6-year cohort a subset of 504 cases had an ICD-10-AM code indicative of a sine qua non or forme fruste SCI/D aetiology, satisfied data integrity criteria, and were retained for analysis.

Socio-demographic characteristics

Table 1 presents the socio-demographic characteristics of this 6-year ICD-10-AM coded APC cohort. Most identified cases were male (60%), mean cohort age was 53 ± 21 years; with a wide variance. The difference between the mean (SD) age of male and female cases did not reach significance (p > 0.05). In relation to ethnicity 25 (5.0%) of the cohort was recorded as Indigenous, as per the NHMRC definition. In terms of family-social support, almost 50% were either married or living in a de facto relationship. At the time of admission 144 (29%) cases were engaged in employment. However, a majority had a "not applicable" employment code denoting self-employment, self-funded retiree or benefit recipient. Analysis by type of social benefit revealed that 108 (21%) were in receipt of a benefit payment; with a minor subset of 25 (5.0%) claiming a disability benefit.

Taxonomic framework

Table 2 presents the frequency and distribution of "Health Condition" codes for the 504 APC cases. The most frequently recorded ICD-10-AM code was "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (48 [15%]). This was followed closely by coding for "Other diseases of spinal cord: Vascular myelopathies" (46 [14%]).

We classified the primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses based on ICD-10 codes and classified these into six main disease groups as most relevant due to their prevalence and clinical importance: circulatory system (I00–I99), infectious diseases (A00–B99), digestive system (K00–K95), nervous system (G00–G99), neoplasms (C00–D49), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00–N99). Congenital malformations of the nervous system (Q00–Q07) were subclassified in the nervous system diseases, congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20–Q28) were subclassified in the circulatory system diseases, and congenital malformations of the digestive system (Q38–Q45) in the digestive system diseases, respectively. Furthermore, we classified the following infectious diseases classified elsewhere in ICD-10 as infectious diseases: respiratory infections (J00–J22), infectious arthropathies (M00–M02), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00–G09). Secondary diagnoses are defined diseases diagnosed according to ICD-10 and include both acute and chronic diagnoses. Physiognomic or expected features of Down syndrome could not be assessed, since they are not part of the ICD-10 catalogue and are hence not documented in the nationwide dataset used in this study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations characterized by the incidence rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 population person-years, displayed across age groups and stratified by primary reasons for hospitalization. Secondary outcomes comprised (i) the number of diagnoses per hospitalized patient over lifetime, (ii) length of hospital stay (LOS) — defined as days spent in the hospital during the hospitalization, (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, (iv) mechanical ventilation rate, (v) length of ICU stay, (vi) all-cause in-hospital mortality, and (vii) 30-day all-cause hospital readmission.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

In contrast, consistent associations in young girls and boys were found for SROH and intracranial non-traumatic haemorrhage of foetus and newborn (ICD-10 code P52, Fig. 2B, the estimated SMR for young girls was 1.01 after exclusion of the De Maule region, data not shown). Visual inspection of the remaining scatter plots revealed no apparent outliers or leverage points, and gender-stratified analyses revealed undifferentiated associations between Aymara–Quechua ancestry and respiratory distress of newborn (ICD-10 code P22, Fig. 2C, 4% increased mortality risk for young girls and 3% increased risk for young boys per 1% ancestry proportion) and between Aymara–Quechua ancestry and anencephaly and similar malformations (ICD-10 code Q00, Fig. 2D, 5% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion for both young girls and boys). Consistent associations were also observed for Aymara–Quechua ancestry and Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, Fig. 2E, 3% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion for both young girls and boys), Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry and Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (Fig. 2F, 5% decreased risk for young girls and 3% decreased risk for young boys per 1% ancestry proportion) and Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry and other congenital malformations of brain (ICD-10 code Q04, Supplementary Material, Fig. S1, 2% increased risk for young girls and 4% increased risk for young boys per 1% ancestry proportion).

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain [^47be6bba]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain after tissue trauma is frequent and may have a lasting impact on the functioning and quality of life of the affected person. Despite this, chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain is underrecognised and, consequently, undertreated. It is not represented in the current International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). This article describes the new classification of chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain for ICD-11. Chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain is defined as chronic pain that develops or increases in intensity after a surgical procedure or a tissue injury and persists beyond the healing process, ie, at least 3 months after the surgery or tissue trauma. In the classification, it is distinguished between tissue trauma arising from a controlled procedure in the delivery of health care (surgery) and forms of uncontrolled accidental damage (other traumas). In both sections, the most frequent conditions are included. This provides diagnostic codes for chronic pain conditions that persist after the initial tissue trauma has healed and that require specific treatment and management. It is expected that the representation of chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain in ICD-11 furthers identification, diagnosis, and treatment of these pain states. Even more importantly, it will make the diagnosis of chronic posttraumatic or postsurgical pain statistically visible and, it is hoped, stimulate research into these pain syndromes.

### Concordance of ICD-11 and DSM-5 definitions of alcohol and cannabis use disorders: a population survey [^98ddb90d]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

The proposed criteria for alcohol and cannabis use disorders in the 11th edition of ICD (ICD-11) will be presented to the World Health Assembly in 2017, but the beta-phase descriptions have been released. We compared them with those in the tenth edition (ICD-10) and the American Psychiatric Association's DSM fourth edition (DSM-IV) and fifth edition (DSM-5), in a nationally representative sample of adult Australians. Disorders were assessed with the WHO World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The proportions classified as being dependent on alcohol and cannabis were similar with ICD-10, ICD-11, and DSM-IV, whereas for DSM-5, the proportion of lifetime users meeting the criteria for moderate to severe use (most comparable to dependence in the other systems) was far higher. We assessed whether criteria for alcohol and cannabis use described unidimensional syndromes for each, and all definitions seemed to do so. Classification of alcohol and cannabis use disorders, although simplified in ICD-11, was in almost perfect agreement with the classifications of ICD-10 and DSM-IV. With DSM-5, use disorder seemed to capture a different aspect of problematic use and selected a different group of individuals from the other systems. How the newest definitions will become used remains to be seen. The choice of classification might depend on the clinical population of interest.

### Accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying brief resolved unexplained events [^96f448f8]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding strategies for the identification of patients with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged < 1 year with an emergency department (ED) visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018, and an ICD-10 code for the following: (1) BRUE; (2) characteristics of BRUE; (3) serious underlying diagnoses presenting as a BRUE; and (4) nonserious diagnoses presenting as a BRUE. Sixteen algorithms were developed by using various combinations of these 4 groups of ICD-10 codes. Manual chart review was used to assess the performance of these ICD-10 algorithms for the identification of (1) patients presenting to an ED who met the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical definition for a BRUE and (2) the subset of these patients discharged from the ED or hospital without an explanation for the BRUE.

Results

Of 4512 records reviewed, 1646 (36.5%) of these patients met the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for BRUE on ED presentation, 1016 (61.7%) were hospitalized, and 959 (58.3%) had no explanation on discharge. Among ED discharges, the BRUE ICD-10 code alone was optimal for case ascertainment (sensitivity: 89.8% to 92.8%; positive predictive value: 51.7% to 72.0%). For hospitalized patients, ICD-10 codes related to the clinical characteristics of BRUE are preferred (specificity 93.2%, positive predictive value 32.7% to 46.3%).

Conclusions

The BRUE ICD-10 code and/or the diagnostic codes for the characteristics of BRUE are recommended, but the choice between approaches depends on the investigative purpose and the specific BRUE population and setting of interest.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^e09309e9]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The overall cost of RDs is likely larger than the current HCUP utilization analysis. HCUP estimate charges likely underestimate the true costs of these conditions because they do not factor direct costs such as professional (e.g. physician, dentist, and other clinicians) fees, indirect costs (e.g. lost work productivity), and secondary downstream health-care effects.

HCUP databases are useful for giving estimates on a national scale. There are, however, several limitations of HCUP sample data: (1) the frequencies represent hospital discharges, and not patients, and thus, recurrent hospitalizations by the same patient appear as distinct observations; (2) the prevalence data may be affected by hospital coding; (3) databases do not capture outpatient encounters, and the full health-care utilization of patients suffering from RDs is underrepresented; (4) data do not represent the complete universe of all discharges in the United States since not all states participate; (5) hospital charges represent the bill that is sent to the payer, not the actual cost to the hospital which may vary, depending on reimbursement, if any; (6) the number of rare conditions included in this study primarily correspond to ICD-10 codes provided by Orphanet, which is far from the nearly 7,000–10,000 rare conditions currently described; (7) patients with undiagnosed rare conditions are not included in the RD cohort; (8) conditions are heterogeneous and genetic basis may affect only a disease subpopulation; (9) the ICD-10 codes used also include CC, which are unable to be separated from RDs, and thus are included in the health-care utilization and cost data reported here; and (10) we did not distinguish conditions in Table S3 that are indicated as having a genetic basis due to genetic susceptibility, genetic role in the phenotype, or disease-causing somatic mutation(s) from those with disease-causing germline mutation(s).

### Estimating prevalence of rare genetic disease diagnoses using electronic health records in a children's hospital [^2c6ff3f4]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
NLP validation and results for three methods of mapping diagnosis descriptions

Orphanet also provides mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, which are classified as Exact, BTNT (broader term to narrower term), NTBT (narrower term to broader term), and ND (unable to decide). When considering all mapping classes, 5,527 RGD ORPHA codes were mapped to ICD-10 codes in our cohort. However, only 884 ICD-10 codes were used to describe these ORPHA codes, and a total of 149,222 patients in the cohort (a prevalence of 22.6%) had at least one of these 884 ICD-10 codes. This result suggests that direct mappings from ICD-10 to ORPHA codes are not only non-specific but also contain substantial false positives that may arise when a narrower ORPHA code is mapped to a broader ICD-10 code. When considering only the exact mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, a mere 154 ICD-10 codes were mapped to 150 ORPHA codes in 29,777 patients in our cohort. Compared with the results of text-based mapping using the NOBLE Coder-based NLP pipeline, this represents a striking 88% reduction in RGD diagnoses and a 20% reduction in the number of patients identified. Moreover, there is a higher likelihood of false positives in these 29,777 patients, as many ICD-10 codes are mapped to multiple ORPHA codes with only one of the mappings as exact. For instance, H90.5 is mapped to four ORPHA codes (998, 87884, 330029, and 363396); however, only the mapping to 87884 (non-syndromic genetic deafness) is exact. In contrast, the diagnosis descriptions from IMO terminology are often more accurate than ICD-10 codes. For example, in our EHR data, diagnosis texts such as "Aarskog syndrome", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome", "Noonan syndrome", "Russell's syndrome", and many more syndromes were all noted as Q87.19. This ICD-10 code, however, is not used at all in Orphanet. Instead, a different ICD-10 code, Q87.1 is used, which is mapped to more than 60 RGD ORPHA codes.

E-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) ICD-10 coding guidelines — For encounters, an umbrella diagnosis of U07.0 Vaping-related disorder should be used, and examples of additional specific condition diagnoses include J68.0 Bronchitis and pneumonitis due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors; J69.1 Pneumonitis due to inhalation of oils and essences; J80 Acute respiratory distress syndrome; J82 Pulmonary eosinophilia, not elsewhere classified; J84.114 Acute interstitial pneumonitis; J84.89 Other specified interstitial pulmonary disease; R04.89 Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage; and, when no additional condition is specified, J68.9 Unspecified respiratory condition due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors. Other codes that may be relevant in combination include F12.- Cannabis related disorders and F17.29- Nicotine dependence, other tobacco product, with a clinical note describing the type of e-cigarette used; in addition, T65.291- Toxic effect of other tobacco and nicotine, accidental (unintentional) or T40.7X1- Poisoning by cannabis (derivatives), accidental (unintentional), may also be appropriate, and additional codes may be needed to fully characterize an event so that encounters fully comply with ICD-10 coding rules.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome and maternal opioid-related diagnoses: analysis of ICD-10-CM transition, 2013–2017 [^e53db25e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hospital discharge records remain a common data source for tracking the opioid crisis among pregnant women and infants. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification may have affected surveillance. Our aim was to evaluate this transition on rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), maternal opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related diagnoses (OUD with ICD-10-CM codes for long-term use of opioid analgesics and unspecified opioid use).

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample were used to conduct, interrupted time series analysis and log-binomial segmented regression to assess whether quarterly rates differed across the transition.

Results

From 2013 to 2017, an estimated 18.8 million birth and delivery hospitalizations were represented. The ICD-10-CM transition was not associated with NAS rates (rate ratio [RR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90–1.08; P = 0.79) but was associated with 11% lower OUD rates (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.98; P = 0.02) and a decrease in the quarterly trend (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04). The transition was not associated with maternal OUD plus long-term use rates (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89–1.09; P = 0.76) but was associated with a 20% overall increase in opioid-related diagnosis rates including long-term and unspecified use (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09–1.32; P < .001).

Conclusions

The ICD-10-CM transition did not appear to affect NAS. However, coding of maternal OUD alone may not capture the same population across the transition, which confounds the interpretation of trend data spanning this time period.

### International comparison of sudden unexpected death in infancy rates using a newly proposed set of cause-of-death codes [^76155c8b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing rates of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) in different countries and over time is difficult, as these deaths are certified differently in different countries, and, even within the same jurisdiction, changes in this death certification process have occurred over time.

Aims

To identify if International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes are being applied differently in different countries, and to develop a more robust tool for international comparison of these types of deaths.

Methods

Usage of six ICD-10 codes, which code for the majority of SUDI, was compared for the years 2002–2010 in eight high-income countries.

Results

There was a great variability in how each country codes SUDI. For example, the proportion of SUDI coded as sudden infant death syndrome (R95) ranged from 32.6% in Japan to 72.5% in Germany. The proportion of deaths coded as accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (W75) ranged from 1.1% in Germany to 31.7% in New Zealand. Japan was the only country to consistently use the R96 code, with 44.8% of SUDI attributed to that code. The lowest, overall, SUDI rate was seen in the Netherlands (0.19/1000 live births (LB)), and the highest in New Zealand (1.00/1000 LB). SUDI accounted for one-third to half of postneonatal mortality in 2002–2010 for all of the countries except for the Netherlands.

Conclusions

The proposed set of ICD-10 codes encompasses the codes used in different countries for most SUDI cases. Use of these codes will allow for better international comparisons and tracking of trends over time.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^9e9aa8eb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is significantly more expressive and comprehensive than historical versions. The introduction of post-coordination makes the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization more compact, while allowing highly expressive compositional descriptions. Phenotype features are enriched, though fall short of purpose-specific systems such as HPO. Rare diseases existing in the Foundation are not always assigned a linearization code in the MMS, though they do have an independent URI.

Development of the ICD-11 Foundation and linkages to more robust ontologies will continue in the foreseeable future, which we expect will strengthen the use and application of the MMS linearization in clinical description.

n.e.c.: not elsewhere classified. Bold represents associated probability values smaller than 0.05/23 investigated diseases = 0.002.

To examine the robustness of the identified associations, we inspected visually the relationship between gender-specific mortality rates, SROH and ancestry, and performed gender-stratified regression analyses. Figure 2A shows the scatterplot for SROH and disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07). Results are represented in red for young girls and blue for young boys. The corresponding estimated SMRs are shown in Supplementary Material, Table S3. Opposite associations were noticed for young girls (1% risk decrease) and young boys (3% risk increase per Mb in SROH). Results for young girls strongly depended on the data from De Maule region, which showed the highest average SROH (76.2 Mb). However, effect estimates for males and females were even more different after exclusion of this high-leverage observation (6% risk decrease for young girls, data not shown).

### Ocular manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^4b3b8b5a]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials/subjects and methods

This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (TriNetX, LLC), a federated health research platform that aggregates de-identified EHR data of over 99 million patients across 60 healthcare organizations (HCOs). TriNetX, LLC is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the US federal law which protects the privacy and security of healthcare data, and any additional data privacy regulations applicable to the contributing HCO. The process by which the data is de-identified is attested to through a formal determination by a qualified expert as defined in Section §164.514(b)(1) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Because this study used only de-identified patient records, this study was deemed exempt by the Western Institutional Review Board.

Data was collected on July 1, 2024 with a restricted timeframe of 1/1/2012–5/1/2024. Additional data was collected on February 11, 2025 to address reviewer comments. All encounter diagnosis data was extracted using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth/Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) codes as the platform automatically groups these together. Of note, data reporting throughout this manuscript is not a measure of the true study populations as the platform relies on existing data within EHR systems. Thus, in this paper, an EDS patient is defined as a patient who has a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of EDS, the general population is defined as any individual with a visit in the EHR irrespective of an associated ICD-10 diagnosis, and an ocular condition is defined as a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of this condition.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^2c847ed5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^8cdfc2d3]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) epidemiology and classification — The US SIDS rate decreased from 120 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1992 to 56 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2001, representing a reduction of 53% over 10 years, remained constant from 2001 to 2008, and then declined from 54 per 100 000 live births in 2009 to 40 in 2013. In 2013, 1561 infants died of SIDS. Although SIDS rates have declined by > 50% since the early 1990s, SIDS remains the leading cause of postneonatal (28 days to 1 year of age) mortality. The all-cause postneonatal death rate showed a 26% decline from 1992 to 2001 (from 314 to 231 per 100 000 live births), was fairly unchanged from 2001 until 2009 (from 231 to 222 per 100 000 live births), and then declined yearly since 2009 to 193 per 100 000 live births in 2013. Several studies have observed that some deaths previously classified as SIDS (ICD-10 R95) are now being classified as other causes of sleep-related infant death (eg, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed [ASSB; ICD-10 W75] or other ill-defined or unspecified causes [ICD-10 R99]), and at least some of the decline in SIDS rates may be explained by increasing rates of these other assigned causes of SUID. To improve consistency, the National Center for Health Statistics created the special cause-of-death category SUID, which captures deaths with an underlying cause coded as ICD-10 R95, R99, and W75. Historical context includes that in 1992 the AAP recommended nonprone sleep to reduce SIDS risk and the "Back to Sleep" campaign was initiated in 1994.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^a5d430ff]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

### Treacher Collins syndrome in the United States: examining incidence and inpatient interventions [^03ebdedf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advancements have been made in the care of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), but epidemiological data are lacking given its rarity. A national database provides a valuable opportunity for studying the incidence of rare craniofacial conditions. We sought to evaluate disease incidence of phenotypically severe cases and the frequency of the most common associated diagnoses and interventions.

Design

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was the first version to include updated International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding encompassing a unique code for TCS. The 2016 KID was queried for the unique code. Incidence was calculated using national estimates. Diagnosis and procedure codes were pooled and analyzed.

Patients

A total of 266 discharge cases with a diagnosis code for TCS (Q75.4).

Main Outcomes

Disease incidence and the most frequent diagnosis and procedure codes.

Results

The estimated incidence of children born with a diagnosis of TCS was approximately 1 in 80,000. Two of the three most common ICD-10 diagnosis codes were tracheostomy status and obstructive sleep apnea. The most common procedures performed were airway examination procedures.

Conclusions

Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare craniofacial disorder requiring complex multidisciplinary management. Phenotypically severe cases requiring inpatient management may be rarer than previous estimates suggest. Inpatient airway interventions are very common, and multidisciplinary team members should anticipate the degree of potential airway risk these patients pose.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

### Disease trajectory browser for exploring temporal, population-wide disease progression patterns in 7.2 million Danish patients [^0e06aa70]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We present the Danish Disease Trajectory Browser (DTB), a tool for exploring almost 25 years of data from the Danish National Patient Register. In the dataset comprising 7.2 million patients and 122 million admissions, users can identify diagnosis pairs with statistically significant directionality and combine them to linear disease trajectories. Users can search for one or more disease codes (ICD-10 classification) and explore disease progression patterns via an array of functionalities. For example, a set of linear trajectories can be merged into a disease trajectory network displaying the entire multimorbidity spectrum of a disease in a single connected graph. Using data from the Danish Register for Causes of Death mortality is also included. The tool is disease-agnostic across both rare and common diseases and is showcased by exploring multimorbidity in Down syndrome (ICD-10 code Q90) and hypertension (ICD-10 code I10). Finally, we show how search results can be customized and exported from the browser in a format of choice (i.e. JSON, PNG, JPEG and CSV).

### Gastrostomy and congenital anomalies: a European population-based study [^c582bc1e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Surgical procedures were coded according to the coding systems used in the national health systems. Italy and Spain used ICD-9-CM (the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision-Clinical Modification) for the study period, England and Wales used OPCS-4 (Classification of Interventions and Procedures), and Finland and Denmark used national adaptions of NCSP (NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures). The surgery codes used for gastrostomy were 43.11 and 43.19 in ICD-9-CM, G341 and G342 in OPCS-4.8, and JDB in NCSP.

Data were analysed for all children with major congenital anomalies and additional analyses performed on children with the following specific anomalies: spina bifida, hydrocephaly, congenital heart defects and severe congenital heart defects, cleft lip with and without cleft palate, cleft palate, oesophageal atresia, Down syndrome, Goldenhar association, Di George syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Williams syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, Angelmann syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. These anomalies all had specified ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the EUROCAT database and were selected from the EUROlinkCAT list of anomaly subgroupsby a paediatrician (EG) as associated with feeding problems.

There was no parent or public involvement in the study.

### Primary care physicians' use of the proposed classification of common mental disorders for ICD-11 [^7231a3f3]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization is revising the classification of common mental disorders in primary care for ICD-11. Major changes from the ICD-10 primary care version have been proposed for: (i) mood and anxiety disorders; and (ii) presentations of multiple somatic symptoms (bodily stress syndrome). This three-part field study explored the implementation of the revised classification by primary care physicians (PCPs) in five countries.

Methods

Participating PCPs in Brazil, China, Mexico, Pakistan and Spain were asked to use the revised classification, first in patients that they suspected might be psychologically distressed (Part 1), and second in patients with multiple somatic symptoms causing distress or disability not wholly attributable to a known physical pathology, or with high levels of health anxiety (Part 2). Patients referred to Part 1 or Part 2 underwent a structured diagnostic interview. Part 3 consisted of feedback from PCPs regarding the classification.

Results

In Part 1, anxious depression was the most common disorder among referred patients. PCPs assigned the highest severity ratings to anxious depression, and the next highest to current depression; current anxiety was rated as least severe. Considerable overlap was found between bodily stress syndrome (BSS) and health anxiety (HA). The psychiatric interview recorded higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders diagnoses among patients with BSS than did PCPs. PCPs' satisfaction with the revised classification was high.

Conclusions

Results generally supported the inclusion of the new categories of anxious depression, BSS and HA for ICD-11 PHC and suggested that PCPs could implement these categories satisfactorily.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^ef2cf36d]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This is a large cohort of standardised national data within a centralised and nationalised health care system, and therefore represents a unique resource. The CRANE registry has high case ascertainment, and given its national coverage is likely to be representative of children born with an orofacial in England during the study period. A minimum follow-up of 2.25 years in HES data allowed sufficient time for congenital anomalies to be identified after birth. Although the cohort was born between 2000 and 2012, we believe that the knowledge gained from this study is still relevant to people born with an orofacial cleft in the present day. Discordance in cleft subtypes in one fifth of the patient records between the datasets was a weakness as it resulted in the exclusion of otherwise successfully linked data.

The ICD-10 categorisation system of malformations is advantageous because it is an international system that is widely accessible and facilitates thorough documentation of anatomical detail. However, despite the ICD-10 being regarded as the international standard, a variety of different classifications have been used in the literature, which makes comparison difficult. The ICD-10 anatomical subcategorization is not necessarily clinically intuitive and cannot differentiate between minor and major ACMs. Whilst the use of ICD-10 codes allowed us to report many congenital malformations, HES restricts the entry of these codes to 4 characters (eg, Q87.0), which means that some codes were not sensitive enough to distinguish between certain diagnoses (for example, Pierre Robin Sequence and Goldenhar syndrome share the same 4-character ICD-10 code). Furthermore, ICD-10 codes utilised in HES tend to focus on a physical diagnosis or phenotype, rather than the underlying genetic cause. This means the prevalence of specific genetic and/or syndromic diagnoses associated with orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations could not be reported. With the now widespread application of genomic testing, this limitation highlights a need for cleft research cohorts to accurately capture data relating to genetic and syndromic diagnoses.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Accuracy of routinely collected hospital administrative discharge data and death certificate ICD-10 diagnostic coding in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome: a systematic review and validation study [^8bc85f49]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review to identify existing ICD-10 coding validation studies in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome [PSP/CBS]) and, in a new study, evaluated the accuracy of ICD-10 diagnostic codes for PSP/CBS in Scottish hospital inpatient and death certificate data.

Methods

Original studies that assessed the accuracy of specific ICD-10 diagnostic codes in PSP/CBS were sought. Separately, we estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of specific codes for PSP/CBS in inpatient hospital data (SMR01, SMR04) compared to clinical diagnosis in four regions. Sensitivity was assessed in one region due to a concurrent prevalence study. For PSP, the consistency of the G23.1 code in inpatient and death certificate coding was evaluated across Scotland.

Results

No previous ICD-10 validation studies were identified. 14,767 records (SMR01) and 1497 records (SMR04) were assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes between February 2011 and July 2019. The best PPV was achieved with G23.1 (1.00, 95% CI 0.93–1.00) in PSP and G23.9 in CBS (0.20, 95% CI 0.04–0.62). The sensitivity of G23.1 for PSP was 0.52 (95% CI 0.33–0.70) and G31.8 for CBS was 0.17 (95% CI 0.05–0.45). Only 38.1% of deceased G23.1 hospital-coded cases also had this coding on their death certificate: the majority (49.0%) erroneously assigned the G12.2 code.

Discussion

The high G23.1 PPV in inpatient data shows it is a useful tool for PSP case ascertainment, but death certificate coding is inaccurate. The PPV and sensitivity of existing ICD-10 codes for CBS are poor due to a lack of a specific code.

### Comorbidity landscape of the Danish patient population affected by chromosome abnormalities [^7e978c04]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data

Diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR)covering 6.9 million patients and more than 108 million hospital encounters between 1994 and 2015 were available. The diagnoses were encoded in the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), which hierarchically orders diseases in 21 chapters that are subdivided into 227 blocks of similar diseases and 1,702 disease-specific level 3 codes. The level 3 codes are further subdivided with up to four additional characters to indicate etiology, anatomic site, severity, etc. Chromosome abnormalities are encoded in ICD-10 chapter XVII "Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities" in the block Q90–Q99 "Chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified". Eleven well-defined chromosome abnormalities from this block with at least 50 patients each were identified: Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), DS (trisomy 21), KS (47, XXY), triple X syndrome, XYY syndrome, TS (45, X), Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and FXS. Four sub-analyses where also performed: female/male DS and FXS, and non-mosaic/mosaic DS and TS patients where each subgroup had at least 50 patients. Only patients with either a mosaic or a nonmosaic diagnosis in the registry were included in the subgroup analysis. See Table 1 for specific ICD-10 codes for each patient group.

### Inpatient hospitalization costs associated with birth defects among persons aged [^b8ef51ff]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

* Identified by scanning up to 40 available fields for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes Q00–Q99: congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. Patent ductus arteriosus (Q25.0) and atrial septal defect (Q21.1) were not considered birth defects when occurring in neonates aged < 28 days or with an associated indicator of preterm birth (ICD-10-CM codes P07.2 or P07.3). An additional 23 conditions of lesser clinical importance classified within the Q00–Q99 code range were not considered birth defects.

† Birth defects categories correspond to blocks of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: cardiovascular (Q20–Q28), central nervous system (Q00–Q07), chromosomal (Q90–Q99), cleft lip/palate (Q35–Q37), ear (Q16–Q17), eye (Q10–Q15), gastrointestinal (Q38–Q45), genitourinary (Q50–Q64), integumentary (Q80–Q85), musculoskeletal (Q65–Q79), and other syndrome (Q87). "Other defect" includes birth defects of the face and neck (Q18), respiratory system (Q30–Q34), and other congenital malformations (Q86 and Q89). Critical cardiovascular defects were operationalized using the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report. The specific defects included are only those defined in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report; birth defects not included contribute to frequencies and costs aggregated by birth defect category and overall. Because a single hospitalization might include more than one specific birth defect, individual birth defect frequencies might sum to > 100% of birth defects categories or overall frequencies, and mean costs multiplied by frequencies will correspondingly sum to > 100% of total costs.

Results

Systematic review

No studies were identified which evaluated the sensitivity or PPV of individual diagnostic ICD-10 codes for PSP or CBS (Fig. 1). Two of the full text reviewed articles highlighted the incorrect assignment of PSP patients to the "G12.22 Progressive Bulbar Palsy" code (G12.2 codes Motor Neuron Disease).

Frequency and distribution of clinical diagnoses coded using ICD-10 diagnostic codes G23.1, G25.9, G31.0, G31.8, G23.9, G23.8 and F02.0 in SMR01

The clinical diagnoses in individuals assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes are detailed in Table 2. All individuals with G23.1 code (n = 9) had a clinical diagnosis of PSP. Of 61 individuals with the G31.8 code, one individual had PSP listed amongst their differential diagnoses. CBS was not identified. The other clinical diagnoses assigned this code were a combination of parkinsonian (n = 4) and dementia (n = 49) syndrome diagnoses, as well as smaller number (n = 8) of other neurological diagnoses, detailed in Table 2. Few cases were assigned the remainder of the candidate ICD-10 codes. Two individuals, coded with both G31.0 and F02.0, had a predominantly frontotemporal dementia syndrome with potentially suggestive clinical features (postural instability, symmetrical rigidity, frontal behavioural–spatial syndrome) of PSP or CBS, though neither had been given these diagnoses. No cases assigned the G25.9, G23.9, or G23.8 ICD-10 diagnostic codes had a clinical diagnosis of PSP or CBS.

### Assessing the precision of ICD-10 codes for uveitis in 2 electronic health record systems [^532bc7a2]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Electronic health record (EHR) systems based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding of disease entities are increasingly being used to generate large data sets for analysis. However, the reproducibility of ICD-10 coding in uveitis has not been assessed across EHR platforms, and imprecision in coding may lead to improper conclusions in big-data analyses.

Objective

To compare ICD-10 coding of uveitis using 2 EHR systems.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study compares ICD-10 codes for 27 uveitic diseases generated by the Epic and MDIntelleSys EHR systems to the ICD-10 descriptions associated with the codes. No patient data were assessed in this study.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The number of diseases for which ICD-10 coding differed between the 2 systems.

Results

Thirteen of 27 uveitic diseases were coded differently by the 2 EHR systems. Coding imprecision was notable in that the Epic system returned 16 ICD-10 codes and the MDIntelleSys returned 12 ICD-10 codes to describe 13 diseases; 4 diseases had multiple codes returned, and 6 codes were used to describe more than 1 disease. For example, MDIntelleSys uses ICD-10 code H30.13 for both birdshot choroiditis and acute retinal necrosis, while Epic uses H30.9 for both birdshot choroiditis and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; MDIntelleSys uses this code for multifocal choroiditis. Furthermore, the ICD-10 descriptions for certain codes lack specificity, allowing variable interpretation by the coder.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests there is substantial disparity in the ICD-10 codes that are generated for specific uveitides by the 2 EHR systems studied. This result implies that analysis of large databases generated from the pooling of EHR data could produce results with substantial bias because of misclassification resulting from conflicting and imprecise coding of uveitides. Therefore, research into outcomes, costs, health care utilization, and epidemiology in uveitis might be improved if a more uniform coding system to describe ocular inflammatory disease is implemented.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^43fdb678]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^28d3d4c4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Classifications

Classifications are not ontologies, nor are they intended to be. In their most simple form, a classification is a set of categories intended to aggregate a large number of things into a relatively smaller number of groups. Like ontologies, a classification may invoke an ordered hierarchy of categories, invoking increasingly specific category subtypes with each layer of the hierarchy. The connection between one level of a hierarchy and another is rarely specified by the logically formal "is-a" relationship, but more typically informal "broader-than" or "narrower-than" assertions; this is known as the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) (W3C) Classifications are not intended to support logical reasoning, though they can help to organize concepts and can have profound effects on technology and social attitudes (Bowker and Star).

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Validation of syndromic surveillance for respiratory pathogen activity [^33d5b713]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Syndrome Data Collection and Case Definitions

We defined syndrome data as data in health-related registries that reflect infectious disease activity without identifying causative pathogen(s) or focusing on pathogen-specific symptoms (such as routine surveillance data for influenza-like illness or surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis for polio).

Registries for syndrome data were included if they met the following criteria: 1) registration on a daily basis;2) availability of postal code, age, and sex; 3) availability of retrospective data (> 2 years); and 4) (potential) real-time data availability.

Six registries were selected (Table 1) that collected data on work absenteeism, general practice (GP) consultations, prescription medications dispensed by pharmacies, diagnostic test requests (laboratory submissions), hospital diagnoses, and deaths. In all registries, data were available for all or a substantial part of 1999–2004. For the GP, hospital, and mortality registry, definition of a general respiratory syndrome was guided by the case definitions and codes found in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), as selected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). For the laboratory submissions and the pharmacy syndrome, we selected all data that experts considered indicative of respiratory infectious disease (for detailed syndrome definitions, see Technical Appendix).

Table 2 shows the estimated SMR for certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities. Bold type is used to highlight SMR with associated probability values lower than 0.002 (0.05/23), and therefore significant after accounting for multiple testing. SROH was associated with an increased mortality due to disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07, 3% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 1–4%) and to intracranial non-traumatic haemorrhage of foetus and newborn (ICD-10 code P52, 5% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 2–9%). The proportion of Aymara–Quechua ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to respiratory distress of newborn (ICD-10 code P22, 3% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 1–5%) and to anencephaly and similar malformations (ICD-10 code Q00, 5% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 3–7%), and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 4% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −6 to −2%). The proportion of Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to other congenital malformations of brain (ICD-10 code Q04, 7% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 2–12%) and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 5% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −8 to −2%).

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6cf86e4d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses.

Objective

To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (< 50, 50–64, and > 64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare different subgroups.

Results

Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24–0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42–0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16–0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22–0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40–0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (χ2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ2 = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not for cough (χ2 = 5.13; P = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^7319604b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic transitions

Not all genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes; thus, a definitive assessment of genetic disease diagnoses in patients with initial clinical presentations that are indicative of a suspected genetic disease is not possible from an administrative claims-based analysis. However, assessing the proportion of patients transitioning from an initial index diagnosis code in the possible or probable genetic disease categories to a primary diagnosis code in the definite genetic disease category is indicative of a conservative estimate of definitive genetic disease diagnoses. These transitions may have resulted from additional clinical investigations including specialist assessments, the results of imaging or other non-invasive procedures, or, in an extreme minority of cases per the genetic test utilization results above, molecular testing. The number of patients who moved into more definite categories of diagnosis is reported in Table 3.

Table 3
Diagnostic transitions.

The first diagnostic category represents the category of code used for the index event. The second diagnostic category represents a change from a less-specific category to a more specific category during follow-up.

CPT/HCPCS Current Procedural terminology/Healthcare common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), MCA/ID/DD/E: MCA multiple congenital anomalies, ID intellectual disability, DD developmental delay, E epilepsy/seizures.

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the pediatric population, 1.1% and 2.6% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). We observed a higher transition rate in the Conservative cohort — which had at least one genetic test by definition — where 15.8% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable diagnosis to a definite diagnosis within the follow-up period (Table 3).

In the Broad and MCA/ID/DD/E cohorts of the critically-ill newborn population, 5.3% and 6.5% of patients, respectively, transitioned from possible or probable to definite (Table 3). As in the pediatric population, the Conservative cohort had a much higher rate of conversion to definite compared to the other two cohorts: 41.6% of patients transitioned from a possible or probable index diagnosis to a definite genetic disease diagnosis during the follow-up period.

### International time trends in sudden unexpected infant death, 1969–2012 [^bdb2fe67]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The present study is a comparison of historical time trends in SUID, SIDS, and all-cause infant mortality between countries across the globe (1969–2012). Infant deaths were defined as deaths in children during the first year of life. We obtained data from the National Statistical Offices of the respective countries. In the case of missing data, we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database and included additional data if available. Diagnoses were used according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) systems. Our primary diagnosis of interest was SUID. The diagnosis of SUID commonly includes SIDS (ICD-10, R95), accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD10, W75), or other ill-defined or unspecified causes of mortality (ICD-10, R99). We used the broader category ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality (ICD-10, R96–99), as international comparisons have shown differences in the use of individual codes of diagnoses between countries. For example, a high percentage of SUID was coded as other sudden death, cause unknown (ICD-10, R96) in Japan. Codes of diagnoses used for SUID and related diagnoses might differ both between and within countries over time. During the period of interest, the ICD systems changed. We used the following ICD systems: the 8th revision (ICD-8), the 9th revision (ICD-9), and the 10th revision (ICD-10) (Table 1). The years in which ICD systems changed differed between countries.

Table 1
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for sudden infant death syndrome, related diagnoses and all causes of death

A number of countries used other classification systems, such as the 09 N – ICD 9th revision, Special List of causes (tabulation list) (countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, USSR), the 09A/09B – List ICD 9th revision, Standard Basic Tabulation (Croatia, Greece, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand), or the Finnish Classification of Diseases 1987. The German Democratic Republic (GDR), which existed until 1990, used a special version of the ICD for the coding of deaths. For the latest years of our study, all countries - apart from Greece - had adopted the ICD-10 codes. The causes of death in Greece were coded with ICD-9 until 2013.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

### Postconcussion syndrome: a diagnosis of past diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders [^9771ec40]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

After concussion, a subset of patients have persistent symptoms that are functionally limiting and may be difficult to treat. These symptoms were previously captured in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) under the diagnosis of "Post-Concussion Syndrome". However, in the recently published fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, postconcussion syndrome has been eliminated. The elimination of "Post-Concussion Syndrome" moves the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders further away from congruence with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) with respect to the classification of postconcussion symptomology. Although this change likely had the positive effect of reducing misdiagnoses of symptoms due to other causes, the authors highlight the potential issues surrounding the elimination of postconcussion syndrome in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. This opinion piece also emphasizes the multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that may result for those involved in the treatment of, or research regarding, concussion patients with persistent symptoms. Future revisions that provide clear clinical diagnostic criteria may be beneficial.

### Congenital Tooth agenesis and risk of early-onset cancer [^889daa20]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Cancer Diagnosis

Topography and morphology codes were obtained from the Danish Cancer Registryand converted to International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3) codes. The ICCC-3 classification is based on pathology, whereas cancers in the ICD system are grouped according to anatomical location. To ease comparison across age groups, the ICCC-3 classification was also used for adult-onset cancers. If a morphology code was missing (ie, no pathology sample available), an assigned ICD-10 code in the registry was converted to a corresponding ICCC-3 code. If assigning an ICCC-3 code was not possible due to poor specification of the cancer type and location, the event was included only in the analysis of any cancer.

Syndrome Diagnosis

A syndrome diagnosis was defined as either an abnormal karyotype (except balanced translocations) or abnormal chromosomal microarray registered in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Registeror a syndrome ICD code in the Danish National Patient Registry, also including ectodermal dysplasia and incontinentia pigmenti, which are coded as malformations of the skin in the ICD-10 (ICD-8 codes 7592–7599 and ICD-10 codes Q82.3-Q82.4 or within Q85-Q99) (detailed description in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1). Genetic testing for a syndrome registered in these data sources was performed as part of clinical care if the examining clinician suspected a syndromic diagnosis. Results of single-gene tests (eg, colorectal cancer panel screening, including APC and AXIN2) were not available. Tooth agenesis in itself was not an indication for genetic testing within the study period, and no testing was performed as part of this study.

For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

Deaths from natural causes related to the perinatal period (ICD-10 codes P00-P96 or ICD-9 codes 760–779) (eg, congenital malformations [ICD-10 codes Q00-Q99 or ICD-9 codes 740–759], undetermined or consistent with sudden infant death syndrome [ICD-10 codes R95-R99 or ICD-9 codes 798–799]) were identified separately. Deaths from external causes (chapters XIX and XX) were further classified (assault [ICD-10 codes X85-Y09 or ICD-9 codes E960-E969]; self-harm [ICD-10 codes X60-X84 or ICD-9 codes E950-E959]; transport related [ICD-10 codes V01-V99 or ICD-9 codes E800-E807, E10-E819, E820-E838]; drownings [ICD-10 codes W65-W74 or ICD-9 codes E910, E984]; suffocation, strangulation, or asphyxia [ICD-10 codes T71, W75, W76, X88-X89 or ICD-9 codes E911-E913, E915, E953]; fire [ICD-10 codes T20-T32, X00-X09 or ICD-9 codes E890-E899]; falls [ICD-10 codes W00-W19 or ICD-9 codes E880-E888]; poisoning [ICD-10 codes T36-T50, X40-X41 or ICD-9 codes E980-E989]; and suspicious death [possible self-harm, assault, or accidental death (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34 or ICD-9 codes E960-E969 and E980-E989)]).

### Breathing (and coding?) a bit easier: changes to international classification of disease coding for pulmonary hypertension [^66f72f62]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^ac0479d3]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

Our methodology to define the study populations was developed with the goal of identifying pediatric (< 18 years of age) patients with indicators of genetic diseases. Diagnostic codes typically do not classify by underlying disease mechanism, and we therefore manually curated lists of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Technology (CPT), and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, and other relevant billing codes (e.g. neonatal intensive care). A detailed list of all codes used in this study can be found in the Supplementary Information. We then used combinations of these codes (see below) to define patient subsets for analysis. These code sets were initially curated by an expert medical geneticist and were reviewed by claims coding experts at Optum. A similar curation methodology for ICD-9 codes has been previously described, though the current study the code sets were expanded to allow for more detailed classification of patient cohorts and utilization of genetic and non-genetic testing and procedures (by including CPT/HCPCS codes) and to allow for additional timeframe analyses (by adding ICD-10 codes). The code curation process resulted in identification of 1269 ICD-9 codes, 2155 ICD-10 codes, and 781 CPT/HCPCS codes. These codes were further curated with respect to the age of presentation as it is well known that some clinical diagnoses are highly suggestive of a genetic disorder within certain age groups but not others (e.g. isolated scoliosis in a newborn may indicate a genetic disorder, but the same feature in an adolescent is more likely to be multifactorial).

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^f3359c9b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The present recommendations provide a framework for improving diagnosis and management of CdLS. CdLS is a complex disorder, in which many body systems are affected, and it is important that a lead clinician is identified for each patient to ensure coordination of the numerous aspects of care in both childhood and adulthood. The proposed clinical and molecular diagnostic pathways are intended to be universally practical, both in countries with access to modern techniques and in those where this is not yet possible, and they are meant to be cost-effective, avoiding unnecessary diagnostic or management procedures. Still, in some health-care systems and medicolegal environments, the guidelines may need to be adapted. It is important that implementation of the consensus recommendations is accompanied by prospective audits in order to expand the evidence base and allow for future ameliorations of the consensus.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^f9603368]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — differential diagnosis notes that in addition to the 3 most common shoulder conditions outlined in the Diagnosis/Classification section of these clinical guidelines — adhesive capsulitis; sprain and strain of shoulder joint/dislocation; and rotator cuff syndrome/tendinopathy of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and biceps brachii — the following conditions, using ICD-10 terminology, should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with shoulder pain: acute calcific tendonitis/bursitis, arthrosis of the shoulder, primary, arthrosis of the shoulder, secondary, and bursitis of the shoulder.

### Positive predictive value of administrative data for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^31a0d636]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal withdrawal syndrome experienced by some infants with opioid exposure. Hospital administrative data are commonly used for research and surveillance but have not been validated for NAS. Our objectives for this study were to validate the diagnostic codes for NAS and to develop an algorithm to optimize identification.

Methods

Tennessee Medicaid claims from 2009 to 2011 (primary sample) and 2016 (secondary sample; post- International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM]) were obtained. Cases of NAS were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code (2009–2011) 779.5 and ICD-10-CM code (2016) P96.1. Medical record review cases were then conducted by 2 physicians using a standardized algorithm, and positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated. Algorithms were developed for optimizing the identification of NAS in administrative data.

Results

In our primary sample of 112029 mother-infant dyads, 950 potential NAS cases were identified from Medicaid claims data and reviewed. Among reviewed records, 863 were confirmed as having NAS (including 628 [66.1%] cases identified as NAS requiring pharmacotherapy, 224 [23.5%] as NAS not requiring pharmacotherapy, and 11 [1.2%] as iatrogenic NAS), and 87 (9.2%) did not meet clinical criteria for NAS. The PPV of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code for NAS in clinically confirmed NAS was 91% (95% confidence interval: 88.8%-92.5%). Similarly, the PPV for the ICD-10-CM code in the secondary sample was 98.2% (95% confidence interval: 95.4%-99.2%). Algorithms using elements from the Medicaid claims and from length of stay improved PPV.

Conclusions

In a large population-based cohort of Medicaid participants, hospital administrative data had a high PPV in identifying cases of clinically diagnosed NAS.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^c2389deb]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^c3c19630]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent IASP consensus meeting in Valencia, Spain, addressed another important CRPS diagnostic subtype issue. In both the 1994 and 2012 versions of the IASP criteria, there was no CRPS subtype category to capture patients who had previously been diagnosed with CRPS, then improved sufficiently to no longer meet the full criteria but suffered from continued symptoms requiring ongoing care. This significant clinical issue prompted the proposal of a new formal CRPS subtype termed "CRPS with Remission of Some Features". This subtype will be included in the new ICD-11 version of the CRPS criteria. It should be applied only to patients who were documented to meet full CRPS criteria at an earlier point in time but who currently do not display sufficient signs and symptoms to meet full criteria. Patients in this category are not necessarily improved with regards to pain intensity nor are they free of all CRPS-related signs and symptoms, and they may "relapse". We empirically note the occasional patient who may fully meet diagnostic criteria one day and not the next. It is critical for legal and insurance reasons that temporarily not meeting criteria, for whatever reason, is not considered equal to a "cure" of the condition, particularly given the known lability of CRPS features.

A final CRPS subtyping issue is the distinction between CRPS-Type I (without "major nerve damage") and CRPS-Type II (with "major nerve damage"; see Table 2). This is an historical distinction carried over into the 1994 IASP CRPS criteria based on the previously separate diagnostic categories of RSD (now CRPS-Type I) and Causalgia (now CRPS-Type II). At the time of the Budapest consensus group meeting, there was broad agreement that problems do exist with creating this division given the large overlap in clinical features between them (i.e. the primary diagnostic criteria are identical). The group was concerned that these divisions are dependent on nebulous definitions of what constitutes "major nerve damage", and regarding what tests or criteria were necessary to make this distinction (e.g. electrodiagnosis, which is almost always too painful). Despite agreement that the CRPS-Type I vs. Type II distinction may neither be clinically significant nor affect the specific therapeutic method used, this distinction was retained by the Budapest group largely for historical reasons, and remains a formal subtype in the 2012 IASP CRPS criteria and the CRPS criteria to be included in the new ICD-11, pending more data.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### The collective impact of rare diseases in Western Australia: an estimate using a population-based cohort [^4008fea7]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The whole cohort of this study represents 2.0% of the state population in 2010. This is comparable to a study by Mazzucato et al. that extrapolated prevalence data calculated from a population-based registry to estimate that 1.3 to 2% of the European Union population are living with an RD. However, this is considerably lower than the usually reported estimates of 6–8% of the population living with an RD. Results from this study should be considered as minimum values for reasons that include the following: (i) the RD resource set used in this study contained only 467 of the estimated 6,000 to 8,000 RD, (ii) RD are likely to be incorrectly or insufficiently coded in administrative data sets because physicians may not know or use appropriate codes for certain RD, and (iii) people who used outpatient, general practitioner, emergency, and allied health services without inpatient services were not included. Although it is difficult to estimate the extent, these factors could contribute to a significant underestimate of the number of people in WA with an RD.

Substantial elements of the shortfalls of RD coding internationally will be addressed through the next release of ICD codes (ICD-11). Specifically, Orphanet coding is expected to be formally integrated within ICD-11. This means there will be an internationally accepted and comprehensive data-classification system that supports RD if and when ICD-11 is adopted and implemented. Health-data systems may consider earlier incorporation of Orpha codes into data collections so that as ICD-11 is introduced into health-data collections, there will be the capacity to continue to effectively record and report local RD data. Such actions are consistent with the European Commission Expert Group on RD recommendation adopted in November 2014 for national health-care coding systems to consider using Orpha codes in addition to ICD-10 codes when an RD has no specific ICD-10 code.
