Antitrypsin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, including its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and controversies, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its genetic basis. Then, I should verify the molecular pathophysiology in liver and lung. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to examine clinical phenotypes and natural history. Then, I should confirm diagnostic algorithms and thresholds. Next, I will evaluate management, including augmentation therapy and guideline positions. Finally, I will consider controversies, emerging therapies, and synthesize a practical approach with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and genetic basis. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal codominant disorder caused by mutations in SERPINA1, encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin, a hepatically produced serine protease inhibitor that protects the lung from neutrophil elastase–mediated proteolysis; the Z allele (Glu366Lys) is most common and causes severe deficiency, while the S allele (Glu288Val) causes milder deficiency, and normal M alleles yield typical serum levels around 20–53 micromol/L [^8c176a34] [^6388af50].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology in the liver versus the lung. In hepatocytes, misfolded Z-AAT polymers accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing proteotoxic injury and risk of cirrhosis; in the lung, reduced circulating AAT fails to neutralize neutrophil elastase, tipping the protease–antiprotease balance toward elastin destruction and emphysema, with additional inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of AAT itself and its polymers contributing to disease progression [^11335182] [^06e144a1].

> I need to check epidemiology and risk modifiers. Severe AATD (typically ZZ) affects roughly 1 in 2,000–5,000 individuals in populations of European ancestry, with carrier frequencies higher in some regions; smoking markedly accelerates lung disease, and environmental exposures worsen outcomes, whereas liver disease risk is driven by the toxic gain-of-function Z protein and shows variable penetrance across ages [^15f529d3] [^7a2feef8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical phenotypes. I should confirm the spectrum. Lung disease typically presents as early-onset emphysema with basal predominance and airflow obstruction, often misdiagnosed as asthma or smoking-related COPD; liver disease ranges from neonatal cholestasis to adult-onset cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; less common features include necrotizing panniculitis and vasculitis, and disease severity is heterogeneous even within the same genotype, reflecting modifiers and exposures [^4fa102f9] [^19c6d8ac] [^2e950af0] [^630aa80a].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm and thresholds. Let me first confirm the screening indications: test patients with COPD regardless of age, adult-onset asthma with fixed obstruction, unexplained bronchiectasis, and unexplained chronic liver disease; then obtain a quantitative serum AAT level, recognizing that levels below about 11 micromol/L (0.57 g/L) indicate severe deficiency and increased emphysema risk; if low, proceed to genotyping for S and Z alleles and consider expanded sequencing when suspicion remains high; baseline spirometry and, in symptomatic patients or those with abnormal PFTs, chest CT to phenotype emphysema are recommended [^b7872d09] [^73631f1a] [^8574d470] [^f689bc38] [^8f8dbf06] [^96d1b095] [^e4ab2d36].

> I will now examine management principles. Smoking cessation is paramount and universally recommended; standard COPD care applies, including bronchodilators, vaccination, and pulmonary rehabilitation; for liver disease, manage complications and consider transplant in decompensated cirrhosis; lifestyle counseling to avoid tobacco, obesity, and excess alcohol is emphasized in liver-focused guidance [^6f6fa50c] [^7a2feef8] [^9fdb214c].

> But wait, what about augmentation therapy — does it work and in whom should I offer it. Let me reconsider the evidence hierarchy. The strongest signal comes from CT densitometry: randomized and observational data show that IV AAT at 60 mg/kg weekly slows the loss of lung density, a surrogate for emphysema progression; effects on FEV₁ decline are modest and not consistently significant across RCTs, and mortality data are limited and low quality; nonetheless, contemporary guidelines increasingly support considering augmentation in carefully selected patients, typically never- or ex-smokers with documented emphysema, severe deficiency, and FEV1 in the moderate range, while avoiding use in current smokers or those without airflow obstruction [^d9081bdc] [^3812d884] [^e69e619d] [^ea96a845] [^489182d4] [^0d027016] [^2f3f34cb].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and monitoring. Standard dosing is 60 mg/kg IV weekly; higher-dose regimens have shown improved biochemical endpoints in small studies but are not yet standard of care; routine trough level monitoring is not recommended because pharmacokinetics are predictable and clinical outcomes are the priority; cost and access remain major barriers and should be discussed transparently with patients [^cedd61b1] [^62d2ac58] [^5467e778].

> I need to ensure I address controversies and uncertainties. Critics note that RCTs have not met traditional clinical endpoints like mortality or exacerbation reduction, likely due to small samples, insensitive outcomes, and late initiation after substantial lung damage; observational registries suggest benefit in subgroups with moderate airflow limitation, but confounding persists; cost-effectiveness remains debated, and access varies internationally, contributing to heterogeneous adoption despite biologic plausibility [^637101dd] [^d9081bdc] [^0d027016].

> Let me consider emerging and investigational therapies. Gene therapy approaches aim to restore AAT expression or silence Z-AAT production, with early-phase trials underway; inhaled AAT is being studied to deliver higher local concentrations; small molecules targeting polymerization or proteostasis are in development; these strategies may address both lung and liver disease, but efficacy and safety in humans remain under evaluation [^4e8cc1f8] [^4e8cc1f8] [^f0bf55e1].

> Next, I should review special populations and modifiers. PiMZ individuals generally have near-normal lung function unless they smoke, in whom COPD risk rises; rare SERPINA1 variants beyond S and Z can contribute to deficiency and lung disease risk in aggregate, underscoring the value of sequencing when suspicion is high; pediatric liver disease warrants early recognition and transplant referral when indicated [^67db2b24] [^ab7f641c] [^9fdb214c].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical approach. Suspect AATD in atypical COPD, early-onset emphysema, fixed-obstruction asthma, unexplained bronchiectasis, or chronic liver disease; confirm with serum AAT quantification and genotyping; stage lung disease with spirometry and CT; institute smoking cessation and standard COPD care; discuss augmentation therapy in eligible ex- or never-smokers with emphysema and severe deficiency, emphasizing CT densitometry benefits and uncertain FEV₁/mortality effects; monitor annually with spirometry and periodic liver assessment; consider clinical trials and refer for transplant evaluation when appropriate [^fc64e6c2] [^f689bc38] [^e4ab2d36] [^1bbceb23] [^9f48d3c3] [^0d027016].

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a **serine protease inhibitor** produced primarily by the liver, with a key role in protecting lung tissue from neutrophil elastase–mediated damage [^5c1c43b2]. AAT deficiency is a **genetic disorder** caused by SERPINA1 mutations, most commonly the Z allele, leading to reduced circulating AAT and increased risk of early-onset emphysema and liver disease [^8c176a34]. Diagnosis relies on **serum AAT level, phenotyping, and genotyping** [^f689bc38] [^ad62dc6c]. Management includes smoking cessation, standard COPD care, and intravenous AAT augmentation for patients with severe deficiency and airflow obstruction, which slows emphysema progression and may improve survival, though cost and access remain challenges [^9f48d3c3] [^0d027016]. Emerging therapies such as gene therapy and inhaled AAT are under investigation [^8c5f156c].

## Structure and function

- **Structure**: AAT is a 52 kDa glycoprotein belonging to the serpin superfamily, characterized by a flexible reactive center loop that traps target proteases [^833d508f].

- **Function**: Its primary role is to inhibit neutrophil elastase, protecting lung elastin from proteolytic destruction; it also has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [^833d508f].

- **Normal levels**: Serum AAT typically ranges from 20–53 micromol/L (1.0–2.7 g/L), with a protective threshold of ~11 micromol/L (0.57 g/L) [^6388af50].

---

## Genetic variants and deficiency

- **Common variants**: The Z allele (Glu342Lys) causes misfolding and polymerization, reducing plasma AAT to 10–15% of normal; the S allele (Glu264Val) causes milder deficiency (~50–60% of normal) [^8c176a34].

- **Prevalence**: Severe deficiency (ZZ) affects ~1 in 2,000–5,000 individuals of European ancestry, with carrier frequencies of 2–5% for the Z allele [^5c1c43b2].

- **Pathophysiology**: Low circulating AAT permits unchecked elastase activity, causing emphysema; polymer accumulation in hepatocytes causes liver disease [^5c1c43b2].

---

## Clinical manifestations

| **Organ system** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Lung | - Early-onset emphysema (especially basal) <br/> - Chronic bronchitis <br/> - Recurrent respiratory infections <br/> - Rapidly progressive airflow obstruction [^4fa102f9] [^19c6d8ac] |
| Liver | - Neonatal cholestasis <br/> - Chronic hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatocellular carcinoma [^a5f3f506] |
| Skin | - Necrotizing panniculitis (rare) [^2e950af0] |
| Systemic | - Vasculitis (e.g. granulomatosis with polyangiitis) (rare) [^630aa80a] |

---

## Diagnosis

- **Screening**: Test patients with COPD, unexplained bronchiectasis, chronic liver disease, or adult-onset asthma with fixed obstruction [^fc64e6c2] [^8574d470] [^73631f1a].

- **Initial test**: Quantitative serum AAT level; values < 11 micromol/L suggest deficiency [^f689bc38] [^6388af50].

- **Confirmatory tests**: Phenotyping (Pi-typing) and genotyping (S and Z alleles; expanded sequencing if needed) [^ad62dc6c] [^96d1b095].

- **Imaging**: Baseline chest CT to assess emphysema distribution and severity [^3812d884].

---

## Management

### General measures

General measures include **smoking cessation** — the most critical intervention to slow lung damage [^6f6fa50c] — and **standard COPD care** with bronchodilators, vaccination, and pulmonary rehabilitation [^notfound].

---

### Augmentation therapy

- **Indication**: Intravenous AAT (60 mg/kg weekly) for severe deficiency (e.g. ZZ) with airflow obstruction (FEV₁ 35–60% predicted) [^9f48d3c3] [^ea96a845].

- **Benefits**: Slows emphysema progression (preserves CT lung density) and may reduce mortality in appropriately selected patients [^0d027016] [^2f3f34cb].

- **Limitations**: Expensive, lifelong therapy; not indicated for current smokers, MZ/SZ heterozygotes, or liver disease alone [^489182d4] [^dd730aa1].

---

### Liver disease management

Liver disease management includes **regular monitoring** of liver function and ultrasound to detect cirrhosis or carcinoma, and **transplantation** for decompensated cirrhosis or advanced liver disease [^9fdb214c].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Gene therapy**: Preclinical and early clinical trials targeting SERPINA1 correction or silencing are underway [^8c5f156c].

- **Inhaled AAT**: Under investigation to deliver higher local concentrations with lower systemic exposure [^72274844].

- **Small molecules**: Agents targeting AAT polymerization or proteostasis are in development [^4e8cc1f8].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **genotype**, **smoking status**, and **access to care**. Untreated ZZ individuals face accelerated lung function decline and reduced life expectancy, whereas augmentation therapy and smoking cessation improve outcomes [^5c1c43b2] [^0d027016].

---

Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a **critical antiprotease** whose deficiency causes significant lung and liver disease. Early diagnosis, risk-factor modification, and targeted augmentation therapy are essential to slow disease progression, while emerging gene and protein-based therapies offer hope for definitive treatment.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^a5f3f506]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disease affecting the lung and liver. The typical pulmonary manifestation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in young adulthood, and terminal respiratory insufficiency causes premature death in many patients. In the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may manifest as benign neonatal hepatitis syndrome; a small percentage of adults develop liver fibrosis, with progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The alpha-1 antitrypsin molecule is a serine protease inhibitor that is predominantly produced in the liver. Its most important physiologic functions are the protection of pulmonary tissue from aggressive proteolytic enzymes and regulation of pulmonary immune processes. Diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be established by measurement of the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration or by genetic analysis. Treatment is similar to the usual treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A further option is substitution therapy with human alpha-1 antitrypsin. The targets of treatment are the prevention of the accelerated decline of pulmonary function, reduction of lung infections, and improvements in exercise capacity.

### Augmentation therapy in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^756a22e3]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that leads to early-onset emphysema. Recently, exogenous supplementation of the enzyme has become a therapeutic alternative.

Objective

To review the role of so-called augmentation therapy with pooled human plasma alpha-1 antitrypsin as a specific treatment for emphysema caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Methods

The authors performed a Medline (1966–2007) search with the keywords 'alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency' and 'therapy'. The authors focused on articles regarding biochemical and clinical efficacy.

Results/Conclusion

Augmentation therapy has been shown to raise antiprotease serum and epithelial lining fluid levels above the 'protective threshold' value. Evidence suggests that this approach slows the decline in lung function, could reduce infection rates, might enhance survival, and is well tolerated. Questions about the cost-effectiveness of this therapy remain.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy: current status [^b33da141]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that predisposes to the development of early-onset emphysema and, in some instances, liver disease. The use of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy in the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency related emphysema is much debated and the purpose of this review is to examine the results of recent studies. We will comment briefly on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease together with new therapeutic approaches currently under intense research.

Recent Findings

Several nonrandomized observational studies and one meta-analysis on the clinical effectiveness of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement treatment showed a favourable result towards reducing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) deterioration in alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient individuals with moderate lung disease or accelerated FEV₁ decline. Improved ways of monitoring disease progression, including computed tomography scanning and exacerbations, are being proposed as primary endpoints. Apart from one small randomized, placebo-controlled trial using computed tomography scanning, which showed a trend toward preservation of lung density on scanning with treatment, the literature lacks proof of effectiveness from large randomized trials.

Summary

There might be a possible, but so far unproven, role of alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy in reducing the progression of emphysema in subsets of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are required to draw firm conclusions. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology provide opportunities for development of new therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.

### Α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency: what has it ever done for us? [^80bdbda5]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The first five cases of α1-antitrypsin deficiency were originally published in 1963. This changed our whole concept about the pathophysiology of emphysema, including the role of inflammation and, in particular, the role of proteolytic enzymes. However, the observation also had a significant 50-year impact on many aspects of protein biochemistry, genetics, cell biology, and disease concepts outside the lung as well as the study of COPD in general.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^8c176a34]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The association between severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin and early-onset pulmonary emphysema has been known for several decades. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, and the most common genetic variants causing deficiency are termed S and Z. The molecular basis of the deficiency is the abnormal folding, polymerization, and retention of the variant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The Z variant causes a change in the amino acid sequence (Glu366Lys) and is associated with plasma levels that are 10–15% of the normal M allele, whereas the S variant (Glu288Val) causes a milder deficiency with plasma levels that are 50–60% of normal.

Although the risk for lung disease in ZZ homozygotes is clearly established, the role of additional rare variants of SERPINA1 has not been adequately explored. This is an important issue, as there are more than 100 other rare variants in the SERPINA1 gene that have known or predicted deleterious effects. In addition, whether there is an increased risk for lung disease because of a single copy of the Z allele has been a source of debate in the literature for many years.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^5c1c43b2]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects about one in 2000–5000 individuals. It is clinically characterised by liver disease and early-onset emphysema. Although alpha1 antitrypsin is mainly produced in the liver, its main function is to protect the lung against proteolytic damage from neutrophil elastase. The most frequent mutation that causes severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency arises in the SERPINA 1 gene and gives rise to the Z allele. This mutation reduces concentrations in serum of alpha1 antitrypsin by retaining polymerised molecules within hepatocytes: an amount below the serum protective threshold of 11 micromol/L increases risk for emphysema. In addition to the usual treatments for emphysema, infusion of purified alpha1 antitrypsin from pooled human plasma represents a specific treatment and raises the concentrations in serum and epithelial-lining fluid above the protective threshold. Evidence suggests that this approach is safe, slows the decline of lung function, could reduce infection rates, and might enhance survival. However, uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of this expensive treatment remains.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin in cell and organ transplantation [^71890a4e]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

In this article, we will start by reviewing the novel functions of AAT, then go on to describe the current state of research into the use of AAT in transplantation of islet cells and solid organs. AAT has also been studied for treatment of graft vs host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but analysis of that work is beyond the focus and scope of this review.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. 6: new and emerging treatments for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^3369ac43]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing lung and liver disease, as well as other associated conditions. Most treatment of affected individuals is not specifically directed at AAT deficiency but focuses on the resultant disease state. The only currently available specific therapeutic agent-namely, intravenous augmentation with plasma derived AAT protein-is marketed in a limited number of countries. Treatments aimed at correcting the underlying genetic abnormality, supplementing or modifying the gene product, and halting or reversing organ injury are now beginning to emerge. These innovative approaches may prove effective at modifying or eliminating diseases association with AAT deficiency.

### The discovery of α ₁-antitrypsin and its role in health and disease [^833d508f]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is the archetype member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) supergene family. The AAT deficiency is most often associated with the Z mutation, which results in abnormal Z AAT folding in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes during biogenesis. This causes intra-cellular retention of the AAT protein rather than efficient secretion with consequent deficiency of circulating AAT. The reduced serum levels of AAT contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the accumulation of abnormally folded AAT protein increases risk for liver diseases. In this review we show that with the discovery of AAT deficiency in the early 60s as a genetically determined predisposition to the development of early-onset emphysema, intensive investigations of enzymatic mechanisms that produce lung destruction in COPD were pursued. To date, the role of AAT in other than lung and liver diseases has not been extensively examined. Current findings provide new evidence that, in addition to protease inhibition, AAT expresses anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties, and highlight the importance of this protein in health and diseases. In this review co-occurrence of several diseases with AAT deficiency is discussed.

### Key current clinical issues in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^2ae4d0db]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a common but under-recognized condition on which respiratory therapists can have a large impact. A key recent development is the issuance of an international evidence-based standards document regarding diagnosis and management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This report summarizes that standards document, which recommends more widespread testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, in order to extend the benefits of diagnosis to individuals found to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. An important aspect of the standards document is that evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy is reviewed. Though no definitive support from a randomized clinical trial is available, the weight of evidence favors the clinical efficacy of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy, at least in individuals with moderate degrees of established airflow obstruction. On that basis the standards document recommends intravenous augmentation therapy in specified clinical circumstances.

### Proteostasis strategies for restoring alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^f0bf55e1]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

The function of the human proteome is defined by the proteostasis network (PN) (Science 2008;319:916; Science 2010;329:766), a biological system that generates, protects, and, where necessary, degrades a protein to optimize the cell, tissue, and organismal response to diet, stress, and aging. Numerous human diseases result from the failure of proteins to fold properly in response to mutation, disrupting the proteome. In the case of the exocytic pathway, this includes proteostasis components that direct folding, and export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Included here are serpin deficiencies, a class of related diseases that result in a significant reduction of secretion of serine proteinase inhibitors from the liver into serum. In response to misfolding, variants of the serine protease α(1)-antitrypsin (α1AT) fail to exit the ER and are targeted for either ER-associated degradation or autophagic pathways. The challenge for developing α1AT deficiency therapeutics is to understand the PN pathways involved in folding and export. Herein, we review the role of the PN in managing the protein fold and function during synthesis in the ER and trafficking to the cell surface or extracellular space. We highlight the role of the proteostasis boundary to define the operation of the proteome (Annu Rev Biochem 2009;78:959). We discuss how manipulation of folding energetics or the PN by pharmacological intervention could provide multiple routes for restoration of variant α1AT function to the benefit of human health.

### Issues in the diagnosis of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency [^b6d210a7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient helps modify lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of emphysema. In 2003, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society issued guidelines to improve standards in diagnosing alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. This review highlights key recommendations for diagnosis of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, including the different types of diagnostic tests recommended in the guidelines. Options for patient treatment will be discussed.

### Update on α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: new therapies [^4e8cc1f8]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

α1-Antitrypsin deficiency is characterised by the misfolding and intracellular polymerisation of mutant α1-antitrypsin within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The retention of mutant protein causes hepatic damage and cirrhosis whilst the lack of an important circulating protease inhibitor predisposes the individuals with severe α1-antitrypsin deficiency to early onset emphysema. Our work over the past 25years has led to new paradigms for the liver and lung disease associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency. We review here the molecular pathology of the cirrhosis and emphysema associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency and show how an understanding of this condition provided the paradigm for a wider group of disorders that we have termed the serpinopathies. The detailed understanding of the pathobiology of α1-antitrypsin deficiency has identified important disease mechanisms to target. As a result, several novel parallel and complementary therapeutic approaches are in development with some now in clinical trials. We provide an overview of these new therapies for the liver and lung disease associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### The diagnosis and management of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in the adult [^c7ddae44]. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, more specifically with respect to augmentation therapy, Alpha-1 2016 guidelines recommend to discuss the potential benefits of reducing lung function decline taking into account the cost of therapy and lack of evidence for such benefit with each patient with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency and FEV₁ > 65% of predicted.

### The role of computed tomography for the evaluation of lung disease in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^bc4f279b]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding Comments

The evidence presented in this review suggests that CT scanning is a useful imaging tool to phenotype and measure interventions in AATD. CT lung density seems to be a clinically relevant outcome for emphysema trials. Because some caveats remain, more research is needed before it can be used routinely in clinical practice.

### Α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency [^15f529d3]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

- **Definition**: AATD is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to a deficiency or dysfunction of the α-1 antitrypsin protein.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency involves a deficiency in the α-1 antitrypsin protein. The imbalance of proteases and antiproteases leads to unopposed neutrophil elastase activity and subsequent tissue damage in the lungs.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Europe is estimated at 20 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factor for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic predisposition, as the condition is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant manner. Individuals of Northern European descent are particularly susceptible due to a higher likelihood of carrying the defective gene.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency often present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, and recurrent respiratory infections. In some cases, the disease may also manifest as unexplained bronchiectasis. In rare cases, it can also lead to liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary widely among patients. The disease is generally progressive, with the potential for significant lung damage over time.

### Improving detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: role of the allergist [^ab43f96f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that manifests as lung and/or liver disease. Because symptoms of AATD overlap with those of common pulmonary and hepatic conditions, AATD is often misdiagnosed, which has resulted in substantial underdiagnosis of AATD worldwide. Although screening patients for AATD is recommended, the lack of procedures to facilitate testing remains a barrier to accurate diagnosis of AATD. Delays in AATD diagnosis can worsen outcomes for patients by postponing appropriate disease-modifying treatments. Patients with AATD-related lung disease experience symptoms similar to other obstructive lung disorders and are often misdiagnosed for years. In addition to existing screening guidelines, we recommend that screening for AATD become a standard part of allergists' workups of patients with asthma and fixed obstructive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis without known origin, and patients under consideration for treatment with biologics. This Rostrum article reviews screening and diagnostic tests available in the United States and emphasizes evidence-based strategies to increase testing frequency and improve AATD detection rates. We underscore the pivotal role of allergists in managing care for patients with AATD. Finally, we urge health care providers to be aware of potentially poor clinical outcomes among patients with AATD during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

### Intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin for hospitalized patients with COPD… [^e2f246bf]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Intravenous augmentation therapy with purified preparations of AAT derived from human plasma is a well consolidated specific therapeutic option to treat the severe deficient state of AAT. Prolastin is used to restore the balance between AAT and elastases in the lung and consequently to prevent a further deterioration in the pulmonary emphysema. Recently, in patients with COVID-19, without genetically lowered AAT levels with moderate to severe ARDS, treatment with AAT was demonstrated to be safe, feasible, and biochemically efficacious as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic therapy. Secondary outcomes are:

- Difference in change in plasma concentration of IL-1b, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, and soluble TNF receptor 1, CRP at 7 days after randomization.
- Differences in AAT antielastase activity, the amount of active elastase, the AAT levels in serum at baseline and at 7 days after randomization.

Alpha1-antitrypsin is an acute phase protein with antineutrophil elastase properties and several studies have demonstrated an elevation of acute phase proteins during COPD exacerbations. Intravenous augmentation therapy with purified preparations of AAT, derived from human plasma, is a well consolidated specific therapeutic option to treat the severe deficient state of AAT. In turn, the abrupt cessation of AAT augmentation therapy for patients with a hereditary deficiency of the protein results in increased systemic inflammation and subsequent progression of emphysema and COPD. Recently, in patients with COVID-19, without genetically lowered AAT levels with moderate to severe ARDS, treatment with AAT was demonstrated to be safe, feasible, and biochemically efficacious as an anti-inflammatory therapy.

This suggests a potential protective effect of AAT in treating COPD exacerbations in subjects without the genetic deficiency of AAT because of the anti-inflammatory effect of AAT. Secondary objectives:

- to determine the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of IV Prolastin administered once at 120 mg per kilogram of body weight on plasma concentration of other biomarkers which have been implicated in pulmonary and systemic inflammation, and also to be suppressed by AAT in vivo to identify treatment failure as assessed by: Primary study outcome:

- change in level of circulating IL-6 in plasma at 7 days after IMP administration, as measured by ELISA. Secondary study outcomes:

### Anti-proteases and alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy [^72274844]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that first highlighted the importance of protease balance in normal lung homeostasis. Proteases such as neutrophil elastase are important in many pulmonary diseases. However, the first commercially licensed anti-protease therapy was used for emphysema in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The 4 commercial alpha-1 protease inhibitor preparations in the United States are currently given intravenously to augment the serum and alveolar epithelial lining fluid concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Since the discovery of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in 1963, many genetic polymorphisms of the SERPINA1 gene have been discovered. Because neutrophilic inflammation is the hallmark of usual COPD, anti-protease therapy also has been explored in this disease. Further trials with different dosing schema, inhaled therapy, and in different disease states are all ongoing. These studies would be facilitated by having COPD outcomes that are independent of measurement of air flow and achievable in smaller populations over a short period of time.

### Intravenous α-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy for treating patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency and lung disease [^d9081bdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People who smoke are more seriously affected and have a greater risk of dying from the disease. Therefore, the primary treatment is to help people give up smoking. There are now also preparations available that contain alpha-1 antitrypsin, but it is uncertain what their clinical effect is.

Objectives

To review the benefits and harms of augmentation therapy with intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and lung disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to 25 March 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin compared with placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two review authors independently selected trials, extracted outcome data and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

We included three trials (283 participants in the analyses) that ran for two to three years. All participants were ex- or never-smokers and had genetic variants that carried a high risk of developing COPD. Only one trial reported mortality data (one person of 93 died in the treatment group and three of 87 died in the placebo group). There was no information on harms in the oldest trial. Another trial reported serious adverse events in 10 participants in the treatment group and 18 participants in the placebo group. In the most recent trial, serious adverse events occurred in 28 participants in each group. None of the trials reported mean number of lung infections or hospital admissions. In the two trials that reported exacerbations, there were more exacerbations in the treatment group than in the placebo group, but the results of both trials included the possibility of no difference. Quality of life was similar in the two groups. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) deteriorated more in participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group but the confidence interval (CI) included no difference (standardised mean difference -0.19, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.05; P = 0.12). For carbon monoxide diffusion, the difference was -0.11 mmol/minute/kPa (95% CI -0.35 to 0.12; P = 0.34). Lung density measured by computer tomography (CT) scan deteriorated significantly less in the treatment group than in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 0.86 g/L, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.42; P = 0.002). Several secondary outcomes were unreported in the largest and most recent trial whose authors had numerous financial conflicts of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

This review update added one new study and 143 new participants, but the conclusions remain unchanged. Due to sparse data, we could not arrive at a conclusion about the impact of augmentation therapy on mortality, exacerbations, lung infections, hospital admission and quality of life, and there was uncertainty about possible harms. Therefore, it is our opinion that augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin cannot be recommended.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^ad1a0cdc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the main strengths of the study was that a large number of non-Hispanic white patients were sequenced across the entire SERPINA1 coding region. Larger sample sizes for different ethnic groups need to be studied, but the identification of group-specific variants provides a good rationale for performing such studies. Another strength was that the study participants all had significant smoke exposure, thus reducing the potential for lack of penetrance of the variants. The availability of measurements of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin was an important asset in this study, as it helped guide the interpretation of the genetic association data.

This study illustrates the difficulty in analyzing rare genetic variants: Although there may be significant associations when considered in aggregate (i.e.g.ene-based burden testing), there are often too few individuals with each variant to test individually with sufficient power. Nevertheless, rare variants are potentially important for the individual patient, and therefore additional large-scale studies such as this are warranted.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibits TMPRSS2 protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^192169d8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through inhalation of droplets and aerosols and subsequent infection of cells of the respiratory tract. In many cases, infection is limited to the upper airways resulting in no or mild symptoms. Severe disease is caused by viral dissemination to the lungs ultimately resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. The airway epithelium acts as a frontline defense against respiratory pathogens via the mucociliary clearance and its immunological functions. The epithelial lining fluid is rich in innate immunity peptides as well as proteins with antibacterial and antiviral activity, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin or defensins. Currently, our knowledge about innate immune defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract is limited.

To identify endogenous antiviral peptides and proteins, we previously generated peptide/protein libraries from body fluids and tissues and screened the resulting fractions for antiviral factors. This approach allowed to identify novel modulators of HIV-1, CMV, and HSV-2infection, with prospects for clinical development as antiviral drugs. In this work, we set out to identify factors of the respiratory tract that block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Screening a peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage allowed to identify α 1 -antitrypsin (α 1 AT), a highly abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor, as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. We show that α 1 AT suppresses viral replication in cell lines and human airway epithelial cultures and that it binds and inactivates the serine protease TMPRSS2, which enzymatically primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for membrane fusion. Hence, α 1 AT blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry by inhibiting TMPRSS2, and may play an important role in the innate immune defense against the novel coronavirus. Our findings suggest that repurposing of α 1 AT-containing drugs has prospects for treatment of COVID-19.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^ab7f641c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Ortega and colleagues (pp.) present a comprehensive survey of all genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene in a large study sample. The authors sequenced the entire SERPINA1 gene in 2,168 heavy smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) drawn from the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study) study. The subjects represent three ethnic groups, and measures of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin levels were available for 64% of the study participants. This landmark study sheds light on the role of non-Z SERPINA1 variants and heterozygosity for the Z allele in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The sequencing identified 26 variants in the SERPINA1 gene that cause an amino acid substitution in the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein and one frame-shift mutation that results in complete absence of protein. Several of the rare variants (allele frequency, < 5%) were unique to a particular ethnic group. In the initial analysis, the aggregate effect of rare variants together with the Z and S alleles on measures of lung function and computed tomography scan evidence of emphysema was tested in each ethnic group. In non-Hispanic whites, highly significant additive effects were observed for several lung function and emphysema outcomes. In addition, the level of alpha-1 antitrypsin decreased with the presence of each additional variant. There were no similar associations in the African American and Hispanic groups, but the sample sizes were much smaller, and there were no individuals with two variants in either group.

### A review of α ₁-antitrypsin deficiency [^6388af50]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

α(1)-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an underrecognized genetic condition that affects approximately 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 individuals and predisposes to liver disease and early-onset emphysema. AAT is mainly produced in the liver and functions to protect the lung against proteolytic damage (e.g., from neutrophil elastase). Among the approximately 120 variant alleles described to date, the Z allele is most commonly responsible for severe deficiency and disease. Z-type AAT molecules polymerize within the hepatocyte, precluding secretion into the blood and causing low serum AAT levels (∼ 3–7 μM with normal serum levels of 20–53 μM). A serum AAT level of 11 μM represents the protective threshold value below which the risk of emphysema is believed to increase. In addition to the usual treatments for emphysema, infusion of purified AAT from pooled human plasma-so-called "augmentation therapy"-represents a specific therapy for AAT deficiency and raises serum levels above the protective threshold. Although definitive evidence from randomized controlled trials of augmentation therapy is lacking and therapy is expensive, the available evidence suggests that this approach is safe and can slow the decline of lung function and emphysema progression. Promising novel therapies are under active investigation.

### Intracellular processing of alpha1-antitrypsin [^e65fa49e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

α(1)-Antitrypsin (AAT) secreted from hepatocytes is an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Its normal circulating concentration functions to maintain the elasticity of the lung by preventing the hydrolytic destruction of elastin fibers. Severely diminished circulating concentrations of AAT, resulting from the impaired secretion of genetic variants that exhibit distinct polypeptide folding defects, can function as an etiologic agent for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, the inappropriate accumulation of structurally aberrant AAT within the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum can contribute to the etiology of liver disease. This article focuses on the discovery and characterization of a biosynthetic quality control system that contributes to the secretion of AAT by first facilitating its proper structural maturation, and then by orchestrating the selective elimination of those molecules that fail to attain structural maturation. Mechanistic elucidation of these interconnected quality control events recently led to the identification of an underlying genetic modifier capable of accelerating the onset of end-stage liver disease by impairing the efficiency of an initial step in the protein disposal process.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: does augmentation therapy work? [^637101dd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare inherited cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that affects an estimated 250,000 individuals in Europe and North America. Although alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy for individuals with AATD has been available since the late 1980s, about 35 years, this therapy has not been uniformly adopted by many countries. Despite the overwhelming logic that replacement of a missing protein would prevent further loss of lung tissue in individuals with AATD, many regulators remain unconvinced of the clinical utility of AAT augmentation therapy in individuals with AATD because clinical trials to date have not met regulatory designated clinical endpoints. The reason clinical trials have not met mandated clinical endpoints is complex and illustrates the challenges of proving that therapies are effective in rare diseases in general.

First is the fact that outcome variables such as FEV₁ are imprecise and only partially reflect the clinical features of AATD lung disease, particularly progressive emphysema, in individuals with AATD over their lifetimes. Second, sample size estimates using FEV₁ rate of decline as an outcome variable may approach 400 subjects in each arm and require 3-plus years to reach significance. Other challenges to designing studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of augmentation therapy include the lack of effective AATD screening programs to identify individuals with AATD and their identification only after they have substantial lung function impairment. Adding to these challenges is the placebo requirement for subjects in long-term intravenous (IV) studies.

An NHLBI registry that followed more than a 1,000 individuals with AATD with and without augmentation for up to 7 years only demonstrated a treatment effect in a subset of individuals with an FEV₁ between 35% and 49% predicted. The validity of this treatment effect has been questioned on the basis of the fact that subjects were not randomized and entered the study having been either placed on augmentation therapy or not by their individual physicians, thus creating a potential bias based on unclear health care decisions.

### Health status decline in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a feasible outcome for disease modifying therapies? [^1d42e19b]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although HS relates to baseline lung physiology and its decline, the changes are minimal with time even in those with documented rapid physiological decline. These data support the role of close patient supervision and monitoring in a specialist clinic and provides fuel for debate about trial designs to assess therapeutic efficacy of COPD disease modification with HS as an outcome.

### Gene therapy for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: an update [^8c5f156c]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Altering the human genetic code has been explored since the early 1990s as a definitive answer for the treatment of monogenic and acquired diseases which do not respond to conventional therapies. In Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) the proper synthesis and secretion of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein is impaired, leading to its toxic hepatic accumulation along with its pulmonary insufficiency, which is associated with parenchymal proteolytic destruction. Because AATD is caused by mutations in a single gene whose correction alone would normalize the mutant phenotype, it has become a popular target for both augmentation gene therapy and gene editing. Although gene therapy products are already a reality for the treatment of some pathologies, such as inherited retinal dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, AATD-related pulmonary and, especially, liver diseases still lack effective therapeutic options.

Areas Covered

Here, we review the course, challenges, and achievements of AATD gene therapy as well as update on new strategies being developed.

Expert Opinion

Reaching safe and clinically effective expression of the AAT is currently the greatest challenge for AATD gene therapy. The improvement and emergence of technologies that use gene introduction, silencing and correction hold promise for the treatment of AATD.

4 SAFETY OF AAT IN HUMANS

Purified, plasma‐derived AAT augmentation therapy for AAT deficiency has been licensed in the United States for nearly 30 years. Long‐term intravenous use of AAT, usually at a dose of 60 mg/kg per week, is well tolerated in AAT‐deficient individuals without reports of neutralizing antibodies. 2, 3 In several studies, deficient individuals randomized to treatment with AAT reported fewer adverse events than those receiving placebo (reviewed in references 2 and 3). AAT treatment of cystic fibrosis patients by both inhaled and intravenous routes also appears to be safe and well tolerated despite their chronic infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria. 44 In early clinical trials for type‐1 diabetes, and in small human trials for other conditions, neither acute nor cumulative adverse effects attributable to AAT have emerged.

### Is more better? Promising biological effects of double-dose alpha 1-antitrypsin therapy [^62d2ac58]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The pilot study reported in this issue of the Journal by Campos and colleagues (pp.) tests the hypothesis that a higher concentration of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) than that achieved with the current standard AAT therapy will more effectively decrease the protease and inflammatory burden in AAT-deficient (AATD) patients. Enrolling 10 patients with AATD who were treated with a standard weekly intravenous dose of AAT (60 mg/kg/wk), they administered AAT at twice the dose (120 mg/kg/wk) for 4 weeks, followed by return to standard dose for another 5 weeks. This approach follows this group's previous analysis of the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of double-dose AAT over the course of 8 weeks in a crossover design with standard dose administration. In the current study, the investigators perform study bronchoscopies to more thoroughly explore the effect of double-dose AAT on airway and airspace parameters of proteolysis and immune responses.

### Human liver organoids: from generation to applications [^c029e41e]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common autosomal codominant disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin, a serine protease inhibitor mainly produced in the liver. Mutations in SERPINA1 cause the accumulation of misfolded proteins, primarily in the liver and/or lungs, leading to liver cirrhosis and emphysema. Several disease models of AATD have been described using organoids, iPSCs, or patient-specific hiPSCs that recapitulate key phenotypic features of AATD such as increased alpha-1 antitrypsin retention or endoplasmic reticulum stress. AATD patient-derived hiPSCs have been used to deepen the knowledge of AATD molecular mechanisms, exploring the role of Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, inflammatory response, unfolded protein response, or the establishment of AATD-associated gene expression profiles. – Importantly, organoids and hiPSCs have been pivotal for drug discovery and therapeutic approaches. hiPSCs were used to correct and insert AATD mutations by adenine and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing, piggyBack, transcription activator-like effector, and zinc finger nuclease technology, with the successful rescue of cellular phenotypes. Importantly, hIPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells were successfully transplanted into AATD transgenic mice in which the "Z" patient mutation was introduced, which resulted in a progressive repopulation of the mouse livers. Moreover, AATD patient-derived hiPSCs and organoids have been used to create a high-throughput screening platform, and several compounds have been tested as treatment options for AATD.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibits TMPRSS2 protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^8774547c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen and primarily infects the airway epithelium. As our knowledge about innate immune factors of the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 is limited, we generated and screened a peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven entry. Analysis of antiviral fractions revealed the presence of α 1 -antitrypsin (α 1 AT), a highly abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor. Here, we report that α 1 AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry at physiological concentrations and suppresses viral replication in cell lines and primary cells including human airway epithelial cultures. We further demonstrate that α 1 AT binds and inactivates the serine protease TMPRSS2, which enzymatically primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for membrane fusion. Thus, the acute phase protein α 1 AT is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 entry, and may play an important role in the innate immune defense against the novel coronavirus. Our findings suggest that repurposing of α 1 AT-containing drugs has prospects for the therapy of COVID-19.

### A review of augmentation therapy for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^cdd3e63d]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a relatively common, but under-recognized condition which manifests commonly with liver cirrhosis and emphysema. Specific therapy for lung-affected individuals with AATD is augmentation therapy, which consists of intravenous infusion of purified human plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Augmentation therapy was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987 for emphysema associated with severe AATD and today, six augmentation therapy preparations, all of which derive from pooled human plasma, have received FDA approval.

Areas Covered

This paper reviews augmentation therapy for AATD, including the various available commercial preparations, their processing and biochemical differences, evidence regarding biochemical and clinical efficacy, patterns of clinical use, adverse effect profiles, cost-effectiveness and potential uses in conditions other than emphysema associated with AATD. Novel and emerging strategies for treating AATD are briefly discussed next, including alternative dosing and administration strategies, recombinant preparations, small molecule inhibitors of neutrophil elastase and of AAT polymerization, autophagy-enhancing drugs and gene therapy approaches.

Expert Opinion

We conclude with a discussion of our approach to managing patients with AATD and use of augmentation therapy.

### Alpha (1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin in human milk: origin, concentrations, and stability [^7638ecb6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The protease inhibitors alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin are present in human milk, but little is known about their roles in protein digestion during infancy. It has been hypothesized that alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin may modulate digestion in the infant gut.

Objective

We determined whether the mammary gland expresses alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin, measured alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin throughout lactation, assessed the resistance of alpha(1)-antitrypsin to proteolysis, and determined the potential of alpha(1)-antitrypsin to affect the survival of other milk proteins.

Design

A pool of complementary DNA from the human mammary gland was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction to detect genes for alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin concentrations were measured in milk samples obtained longitudinally (days 4–47) from 8 women. An in vitro model of infant digestion was used to assess the digestive stability of alpha(1)-antitrypsin against pepsin and pancreatin. Lactoferrin, with alpha(1)-antitrypsin present, was digested by pancreatin, and the digested proteins were separated.

Results

Alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin concentrations were high in early milk and decreased throughout lactation. Polymerase chain reaction products were detected for both genes. After in vitro digestion, much of the alpha(1)-antitrypsin was still intact, whereas many other milk proteins were digested. Much of the lactoferrin was still intact after digestion, but only when alpha(1)-antitrypsin was added.

Conclusions

The results suggest that alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin are produced by the mammary gland and are present in milk in relatively high amounts in early lactation. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin may survive digestion and may affect the survival of other proteins.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — reductions in A1AT levels align with clinical risk, as there is a clear pathophysiological cascade from gene mutation to lower A1AT levels and clinical phenotype, with the most profound reduction associated with the highest risk of emphysema; clarifying the mutation and its impact on serum A1AT levels is important to understand susceptibility to disease risk and progression, and meta-analyses illustrate a significant association between protein phenotypes and resulting A1AT levels, with one study demonstrating increased mortality when comparing MZ to MM.

### The biological effects of double-dose alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy. A pilot clinical trial [^57b45e89]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, further studies are required to determine the functional role of each of the targets affected by AAT level normalization identified in this study. The observation of a possible carryover effect in most of these markers, where the effect of DD therapy lasted at least a month after resuming SD therapy, should be further explored in studies of longer duration to determine when, and if, the potential carryover effect disappears. Clinical studies of DD therapy over a longer time period or the exploration of higher doses, which may yield greater improvements in biological parameters and potentially clinical parameters, should be implemented.

Some important limitations of this study should be mentioned. This was a small pilot study, which reported complete findings in eight patients with AATD. The primary outcome was change in pulmonary inflammatory markers measured in BALF and there are limited previous data on the natural variability of cytokine levels in BALF over such a short time period in healthy individuals, individuals with COPD, and in particular those with AATD. However, the significant changes observed despite this small sample size is a strong hint of the potent effects of DD therapy, at least in the individuals studied here. Unfortunately, we did not include non–AAT-deficient subjects with COPD, healthy control subjects, or a placebo arm to document the variability of inflammatory markers in BALF and better assess the magnitude of changes observed with DD therapy. For this reason, we opted for a three-phase design in which baseline conditions were restored, a design that followed a prior study evaluating the impact of AAT on sputum inflammation. We acknowledge that biological changes do not necessarily translate into changes in clinically relevant outcomes and further studies are required to validate the clinical impact of higher AAT dosing. It is important, however, to highlight that our results cannot be extrapolated to the entire AATD population, because the clinical manifestations in this condition are protean, from no lung symptoms to varying levels of COPD severity. We used defined inclusion criteria to enroll symptomatic subjects likely to have increased lung inflammation, such as presence of chronic bronchitis, exacerbations, or poor quality of life. Therefore, the magnitude of the effects observed might not be reflective of a broader population of patients with AATD.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin is present in the specific granules of human eosinophilic granulocytes [^cca08503]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Eosinophils may be found at sites of inflammation, for example in asthma, allergy and helminthic infestation, but their role in human inflammatory disease is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the presence of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a serine proteinase inhibitor, in human eosinophils. When lysates of highly purified eosinophils were subjected to Western blotting, with a chemiluminescent substrate, immunoreactive bands were seen. An ELISA was developed to measure the AAT content, which was found to be about 100 ng/5 x 106 eosinophils, about 50 ng/5 x 106 neutrophils, and about 25 ng/5 x 106 monocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy showed localization of AAT to the specific granules of eosinophils. During prolonged incubation of eosinophils, no significant increase in the total amount of AAT could be detected by ELISA. However, there was an increased level of AAT in the medium, in parallel with a decrease in the intracellular AAT content, suggesting release of preformed AAT. Apparent complex formation between iodinated elastase and AAT in eosinophil lysates provided evidence that the AAT is functionally active. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that by releasing AAT, eosinophils may, in a microenvironment, play a role in counteracting the tissue damage caused by serine proteinases released by neutrophils in inflammatory conditions.

### Novel variants of SERPIN1A gene: interplay between alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^762a3de2]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is one of the major circulating anti-protease whose levels in circulation are raised during excessive amount of proteases, especially neutrophil elastase (NE) released during the course of inflammation. Proteolytic attack of NE on peripheral organs, more exclusively on lung parenchyma has severe consequence that may precipitate pulmonary emphysema. Normally, human body has its own molecular and physiological mechanisms to synthesize and regulate the production of anti-protease like AAT to mitigate the extent of inflammatory damage. AAT coded by serine-protease inhibitor (SERPINA1) is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and to some extent by macrophages, monocytes, lung tissue etc. The observation that persons with AAT deficiency developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and early-onset of emphysema proposed a role for pathways connecting AAT in pathogenesis. Extensive studies have been done till now to bridge a connection between numerous genetic polymorphisms of SERPINA1 gene and the early onset of COPD. Here in this review, we have comprehensively discussed some of the variants of SERPINA1 gene discovered till date and their association with the exacerbation of obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Ethical considerations in gene selection for reproductive carrier screening [^9ba51eb7]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are homozygous for the Z allele. In people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, lung disease generally starts in adulthood and is exacerbated by smoking and exposure to other lung irritants. Approximately 80–100% of people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency will develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Stoller et al.). Whilst liver disease in people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can occur at any age, the most severe form occurs in infancy, resulting in severe liver damage and death in approximately 2% of children with the ZZ genotype.

As Ruby and Lee's case (Box 3) illustrates, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency provides a good example of the ethical complexity in the notion of severity. The clinical presentation of this condition is both variable and unpredictable. It is however a gene with a relatively high carrier rate (Wienke et al.). A phenotype of severe liver damage and death at a young age would be a reasonable inclusion for RGCS, yet this occurs infrequently and cannot be predicted with certainty. The majority of cases of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are adult-onset, and can be mitigated to an extent by avoiding exposure to environmental lung irritants.

### Detection of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a review [^8c5d93e6]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Screening studies reveal a much larger number of individuals expected to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency than is clinically recognized, with estimates that only about 2–10% of such individuals have been diagnosed. In the context that recognition of alpha-1 antitrypsin may prompt specific interventions (e.g., smoking avoidance, testing of family members, genetic counseling, and consideration of augmentation therapy), diagnosis is important, inviting much attention for efforts to identify affected individuals. Strategies to identify affected individuals include both population-based screening and targeted detection, and available studies have employed both approaches, though large-scale population-based screening is challenging. As reviewed in this paper, targeted-detection studies have generally produced a higher rate of detecting disease, and tend to be more successful with easier sampling techniques. Strategies to enhance detection in targeted studies have included awareness campaigns, easy testing techniques (such as evaluation of dried blood spots and home, confidential testing), and inclusive criteria for testing which span the full spectrum of clinical manifestations of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

### Circulating alpha1-antitrypsin in the general population: determinants and association with lung function [^535a91d7]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our cross-sectional results demonstrated that a complex interrelationship among tobacco exposure, gender, circulating AAT, lung function, and systemic inflammatory status exists. If the observed interactions between these variables are confirmed in larger and longitudinal studies, the potential utility of circulating AAT as a biomarker for susceptibility to respiratory disease seems limited. The reported interactions are also relevant to studying the impact of genetic variation in AAT on lung health.

### Is more better? Promising biological effects of double-dose alpha 1-antitrypsin therapy [^fad580d6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The results of this study are important because they open the door to larger controlled clinical trials to determine whether doubling the dose of AAT replacement/augmentation therapy will improve clinical outcomes in individuals with AATD. This pilot study was, of course, underpowered and of too brief duration to provide information on clinical outcomes pertinent to AATD. Taken together with the earlier crossover study, which suggested that during the 8 weeks of double-dose therapy subjects tended to report fewer exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this pilot study showing improvement in biochemical parameters of lung elastolysis and inflammation provides a source of optimism. Although AAT standard therapy has been adopted as a management strategy for select AATD individuals in the United States, its widespread use has been hampered by skepticism of clinical effectiveness. Most of this is the result of the failure of prospective randomized controlled trials of standard AAT therapy to show a significant effect on major clinical outcomes such as survival, rate of COPD exacerbations, and improvement in lung function, with effectiveness being limited to decreasing the progression of radiographic emphysema. However, it is important to caution against applying the results of this pilot study directly to clinical practice in the absence of data from larger appropriately designed studies that test clinical efficacy. Furthermore, clinical applications will require a careful cost analysis of this already expensive therapy. Also, even in this pilot study of only a few subjects, it became apparent that individuals exhibit distinct responses to double-dose therapy, and as the authors pointed out, a personalized approach may be required and should be considered even in the design of a larger clinical trial.

This report and the recent advances in experimental gene therapy and in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in AATD, highlight the concerted effort of the medical and research community to provide much needed relief for individuals affected with AATD.

### The selective advantage of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^4d79a55b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The S- and Z-deficiency alleles of alpha1-antitrypsin are found in more than 20% of some white populations. This high gene frequency suggests that these mutations confer a selective advantage, but the biologic mechanism of this has remained obscure. It is now well recognized that the S and Z alleles result in a conformational transition within the alpha1-antitrypsin molecule and the formation of polymers that are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Polymers of mutant alpha1-antitrypsin can also form within the alveoli and small airways of the lung where they may drive the inflammation that underlies emphysema in individuals with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. This local production of polymers by mutant S and Z alpha1-antitrypsin may have also provided protection against infectious disease in the preantibiotic era by focusing and amplifying the inflammatory response to limit invasive respiratory and gastrointestinal infection. It is only since the discovery of antibiotics, the widespread adoption of smoking, and increased longevity that these protective, proinflammatory properties of alpha1-antitrypsin mutants have become detrimental to cause the emphysema and systemic inflammatory diseases associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Suspecting and testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-an allergist's and / or immunologist's perspective [^5621277a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary, monogenic disorder with no unique clinical features. AATD can be difficult to diagnose as patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms often mistaken for other respiratory syndromes such as asthma or smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, symptoms related to AATD may also affect other organs, including the liver, vasculature, and skin. The severity of AATD varies between individuals, and in severe cases, the irreversible lung damage can develop into emphysema. Early diagnosis is critical to enable the implementation of lifestyle changes and therapeutic options that can slow further deterioration of pulmonary tissue. Once AATD is suspected, a range of tests are available (serum alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor [A1-PI] level measurement, phenotyping, genotyping, gene sequencing) for confirming AATD. Currently, intravenous infusion of A1-PI is the only therapy that directly addresses the underlying cause of AATD, and has demonstrated efficacy in a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial. This review discusses the etiology, testing, and management of AATD from the allergist's and/or immunologist's perspective. It aims to raise awareness of the condition among physicians who care for people with obstructive lung disorders and are therefore likely to see patients with obstructive lung disease that may, in fact, prove to be AATD.

### Gene therapy for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^091c9c4f]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common single-gene disorder among Northern Europeans and North Americans. The carrier frequency for the common missense mutation (Z-AAT) ranges from 4% in the US to nearly 25% in the Republic of Ireland. Severe AAT deficiency (plasma levels below 11 μm) is most commonly associated with an adult-onset lung disease, with pan-acinar emphysema and airway inflammation, which is thought to be primarily owing to the loss of function of AAT in neutralizing neutrophil elastase and other pro-inflammatory enzymes. In 5–10% of patients, severe liver disease may develop. This may occur at any time from infancy to adulthood, and is thought to be owing to toxicity from the Z-AAT mutant protein that folds poorly and forms insoluble polymers within the hepatocyte, which is the primary site for AAT production. Thus, gene therapy for AAT lung disease is conceived of as augmentation of serum levels (a prolonged form of protein replacement, which is currently in use), while gene therapy for liver disease presents the problem of also having to downregulate the production of Z-AAT protein. Over the years, numerous strategies have been employed for the gene therapy of both AAT-deficient lung disease and liver disease. These will be reviewed with an emphasis on modalities that have reached clinical trials recently.

### Circulating alpha1-antitrypsin in the general population: determinants and association with lung function [^7ded7072]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

The observed inverse association observed between AAT and BMI might also be reflecting different roles of AAT. In general, positive association between CRP and BMI have been observed among obese persons, an effect that was attributed to low-grade systemic inflammation. However, the acute phase response is a complex signalling pathway and different acute phase proteins are distinctly regulated and expressed. Engström et al found a number of inflammation-sensitive proteins to be positively related to BMI, yet AAT levels were highest in healthy men in the lowest BMI quartile.

The cross-sectional nature of the study prohibits assessment of cause and effect as well as differentiation between etiological and prognostic effects of variation in AAT concentrations. This aspect may be of relevance to considerations about the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the observed associations. Dahl et al found the AAT MZ genotype to be associated with lung function among individuals with clinically established COPD, but not among subjects without COPD in the general population. A possible criticism to our paper is the lack of information about potential AAT deficiency pheno- or genotypes in the study population. But we specifically investigated the potential value of variation at the serum AAT protein levels as a biomarker for lung function impairment in the general population. Since the observed associations were insensitive to the AAT cut-off level rare, unrecognized AAT deficiency alleles are an unlikely source of bias in this study. Another concern of the current cross-sectional study, which is embedded into the SAPALDIA cohort, is the potential for selection bias due to non-participation. Never smokers were more likely to participate at follow-up. If serum AAT was associated with the likelihood of participation at baseline or follow-up this could have distorted results on associations between AAT and other factors. Although unlikely, we cannot definitively rule out such bias in the absence of AAT measurements in non-participants.

### Lung inflammation in α-1-antitrypsin deficient individuals with normal lung function [^06e144a1]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Lungs have been shown to serve as a target organ for airborne pathogens and allergens that cause inflammation due to continuous exposure. Previous studies have reported that air pollution, and inhaled particulates stimulate neutrophils infiltration within the airways and increase AAT levels, resolving within days in normal individuals. In contrast, and consistent with our results, there is an increased risk of lung damage associated with neutrophil infiltration in AATD individuals, due to low levels of AAT and unopposed activity of proteases regardless of CS exposure. Furthermore, CS causes lung neutrophilic inflammation which is expected to be larger in AATD smokers than in smokers with normal AAT levels. Neutrophilic inflammation in AATD airways could be exacerbated as a result of AAT polymers deposited in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, acting as potent chemoattractants for neutrophils. Previous studies have shown that CS polymerizes AAT, exacerbating inflammation. Therefore, our results may also support the notion that AATD lung resident cells including alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells play a role in early AATD lung inflammation due to toxic gain of function, analogous to hepatocytes. In this regard, we and others have shown that AATD macrophages with AAT accumulation have impaired efferocytosis, and activation of the unfolded protein response, and spontaneously produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, these findings suggest that early lung inflammation due to a lack of AAT might be part of the mechanism for the progression of AATD lung disease.
