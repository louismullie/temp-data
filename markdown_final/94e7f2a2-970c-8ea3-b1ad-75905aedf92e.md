## Question

A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent burning epigastric pain. His pain improves with antacid use and eating but returns approximately 2 hours following meals. He has a history of chronic osteoarthritis and takes ibuprofen daily. Upper endoscopy shows a deep ulcer located on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb. This ulcer is most likely to erode into which of the following structures?
A. Pancreatic duct
B. Descending aorta
C. Gastroduodenal artery
D. Transverse colon

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which structure a deep posterior duodenal bulb ulcer is most likely to erode into, given the options of pancreatic duct, descending aorta, gastroduodenal artery, and transverse colon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise anatomic location of the duodenal bulb and what lies posterior to it. Then, I should verify which named artery traverses that posterior space and supplies the duodenum. Next, I will consider the classic complications of posterior duodenal ulcers, especially bleeding, and whether erosion into that artery is a recognized pattern. Finally, I will briefly review why the other options are less likely based on anatomy and published imaging or case data, before concluding with the most defensible answer.

> Let me first confirm the anatomy. The duodenal bulb sits immediately posterior to the gastroduodenal artery, which is a branch of the common hepatic artery and courses behind the first portion of the duodenum, supplying the pylorus, duodenal bulb, and head of the pancreas. This posterior relationship places the gastroduodenal artery at direct risk from a deep posterior bulb ulcer, whereas the pancreatic duct lies more medially and superiorly and is not the primary structure abutting the posterior bulb wall [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the complication profile. Posterior duodenal ulcers are notorious for bleeding rather than free perforation because they erode into retroperitoneal structures, and the gastroduodenal artery is the classic bleeding source in this setting. Multidetector CT descriptions and interventional radiology literature repeatedly identify the gastroduodenal artery as the culprit vessel in duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, and endoscopic and angiographic series document active extravasation from the gastroduodenal artery or its branches in posterior bulb ulcers, confirming this anatomic vulnerability [^f3e40bb8] [^13f5b3b4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider the other options. The pancreatic duct is not immediately posterior to the bulb and is more typically involved by post-bulbar or periampullary disease or by pancreatitis-related fistulization rather than a simple posterior bulb ulcer, so it is less likely here. The descending aorta lies far posterior and is not in the immediate retroduodenal field, making erosion into the aorta improbable from a bulb ulcer. The transverse colon is inferior and separated by multiple planes, so erosion into the colon would be anatomically implausible from a duodenal bulb lesion [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any of the provided sources directly name the gastroduodenal artery in the context of posterior bulb ulcers. Yes, CT-based reviews and interventional case series explicitly identify the gastroduodenal artery as the bleeding vessel in duodenal ulcers, including posterior bulb ulcers, and describe embolization of the gastroduodenal artery to control hemorrhage, which aligns with the expected path of erosion in this scenario [^f3e40bb8] [^13f5b3b4].

> Putting this together, the most likely structure for a deep posterior duodenal bulb ulcer to erode into is the gastroduodenal artery, given its immediate posterior location and the well-documented pattern of gastroduodenal artery bleeding from posterior bulb ulcers. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Gastroduodenal artery [^f3e40bb8] [^13f5b3b4].

---

The correct answer is **C. Gastroduodenal artery**. A deep posterior duodenal bulb ulcer is most likely to erode into the gastroduodenal artery, which lies posterior to the duodenal bulb and is the classic source of **severe hemorrhage** in this setting [^f3e40bb8]. Erosion into the pancreatic duct (A) is less common and typically associated with post-bulbar ulcers or pancreatitis-related fistulas, not the bulb [^fd21759a]. The descending aorta (B) is too posterior to be involved by a duodenal bulb ulcer. The transverse colon (D) is not adjacent to the duodenal bulb and is not at risk of erosion from this location [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical relationships and ulcer erosion

The duodenal bulb is the proximal portion of the duodenum, closely related to several important structures. The **gastroduodenal artery** runs posterior to the duodenal bulb, making it particularly vulnerable to erosion from a deep posterior ulcer [^notfound]. This artery is a major branch of the common hepatic artery and supplies the pylorus, duodenal bulb, and pancreatic head. Erosion into the gastroduodenal artery can cause **severe, life-threatening hemorrhage** [^6ee89f42].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting gastroduodenal artery erosion

Multiple clinical studies and case reports consistently identify the gastroduodenal artery as the most common structure involved in **posterior duodenal bulb ulcer erosion** [^notfound]. Arterial bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery is a well-documented complication of deep posterior duodenal ulcers, often requiring urgent endoscopic or surgical intervention [^6ee89f42].

---

## Why other options are less likely

- **Pancreatic duct**: While posterior duodenal ulcers can occasionally fistulize into the pancreatic duct, this is less common than erosion into the gastroduodenal artery. Pancreatic duct involvement is more typically associated with post-bulbar ulcers or pancreatitis-related complications [^fd21759a].

- **Descending aorta**: The descending aorta lies posterior to the duodenum but is not in immediate contact with the duodenal bulb. Erosion into the aorta is extremely rare and usually associated with extensive retroperitoneal disease or trauma, not a typical duodenal bulb ulcer [^notfound].

- **Transverse colon**: The transverse colon is located inferior to the duodenum and is not in direct contact with the duodenal bulb. Therefore, erosion into the transverse colon from a duodenal bulb ulcer is anatomically implausible [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognition of gastroduodenal artery erosion as the most likely complication of a deep posterior duodenal bulb ulcer is critical for **timely intervention** [^6ee89f42]. Endoscopic hemostasis is the first-line treatment, but surgical or angiographic intervention may be required if endoscopic therapy fails or is unavailable [^6ee89f42].

---

A deep posterior duodenal bulb ulcer is most likely to erode into the **gastroduodenal artery**, given its anatomical proximity and the frequency of arterial bleeding documented in clinical literature [^f3e40bb8].

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 53-year-old man who had epigastric pain that he described as a sensation of burning behind his sternum. It persisted for months despite treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized, 24-week studies of ibuprofen and famotidine tablet were conducted in patients who were expected to require daily administration of an NSAID for at least the coming 6 months for conditions such as the following: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic low back pain, chronic regional pain syndrome, and chronic soft tissue pain. Patients were assigned randomly, in approximately a 2:1 ratio, to treatment with either ibuprofen and famotidine tablet or ibuprofen (800 mg) three times a day for 24 consecutive weeks. A total of 1533 patients were enrolled and ranged in age from 39 to 80 years (median age 55 years) with 68% females. Race was distributed as follows: 79% Caucasian, 18% African-American, and 3% Other. Approximately 15% of the patients in Studies 301 and 303 were taking concurrent low-dose aspirin (less than or equal to 325 mg daily), 18% were 65 years of age or older, and 6% had a history of previous upper gastrointestinal ulcer. Although

H. pylori status was negative at baseline, H. pylori status was not reassessed during the trials.

Studies 301 and 303 compared the incidence of upper gastrointestinal (gastric and/or duodenal) ulcer formation in a total 930 patients taking ibuprofen and famotidine tablet and 452 patients taking ibuprofen only, either as a primary or secondary endpoint. In both trials, ibuprofen and famotidine tablet was associated with a statistically significantly reduction in the risk of developing upper gastrointestinal ulcers compared to taking ibuprofen only during the 6 month study period. The data are presented below in Tables 4 and 5. Two analyses for each endpoint were conducted. In one analysis patients who terminated early, without an endoscopic evaluation within 14 days of their last dose of study drug, were classified as not having an ulcer. In the second analysis, those patients were classified as having an ulcer. Both analyses exclude patients who terminated study prior to the first scheduled endoscopy at 8 weeks.

CT appearances of uncomplicated peptic disease

The CT diagnosis of PUD relies on a combination of direct and indirect signs. Among the latter, the hallmark of gastro-duodenitis is represented by mural thickening of the affected portion of the stomach and of the proximal duodenum, which typically shows a stratified appearance corresponding to hypoattenuating oedematous submucosa and enhancing hyperaemic mucosa. This appearance may be either diffuse or focal surrounding the ulceration site, and is best perceptible in views perpendicular to the long axis, and in arterial-dominant or pancreatic phases rather than in portal-venous acquisitions. In the setting of HP- or NSAID-related PUD, gastro-duodenitis is generally segmental and limited to the distal gastric body and antrum (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). The other useful indirect sign which alerts the keen radiologist to the possible presence of an active inflammation is represented by oedematous "stranding" of the perigastric or periduodenal fat (Figs. 1, 3 and 4). Sometimes, adjacent adenopathies may be present (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
A 54-year-old obese male smoker, admitted to emergency department (ED) because of epigastric pain radiating to the back with deep abdominal tenderness, underwent urgent multidetector CT-angiography "to rule out acute aortic disease". Secondary CT interpretation with multiplanar reconstructions identified findings consistent with peptic gastro-duodenitis, namely asymmetric oedematous mural thickening (*) with mucosal hyperenhancement (thin arrows) along the posterior and superior aspects of the distal antrum, pylorus and duodenal bulb, subtle perivisceral inflammatory stranding (+) and at least a centimetric lymphadenopathy (thick arrow in d) [Adapted from Open Access ref. no]

### Ibuprofen [^368a3d77]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history or peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

### Gastroduodenal perforation [^5ea93eda]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The cause and management of gastroduodenal perforation have changed as a result of increasing use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and improved pharmacologic treatment of acid hypersecretion as well as the recognition and treatment of Helicobacter pylori. As a result of the reduction in ulcer recurrence with medical therapy, the surgical approach to patients with gastroduodenal perforation has also changed over the last 3 decades, with ulcer-reducing surgery being performed infrequently.

14.4	Gastric Ulcer

In a US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 253 patients with endoscopically documented gastric ulcer, the percentage of patients healed at four and eight weeks was significantly higher with PREVACID 15 and 30 mg once a day than with placebo (Table 14) [see Indications and Usage (1.4)].

Patients treated with any PREVACID dose reported significantly less day and night abdominal pain along with fewer days of antacid use and fewer antacid tablets used per day than the placebo group.

Independent substantiation of the effectiveness of PREVACID 30 mg was provided by a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data.

14.5	Healing of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer

In two US and Canadian multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with endoscopically confirmed NSAID-associated gastric ulcer who continued their NSAID use, the percentage of patients healed after eight weeks was statistically significantly higher with 30 mg of PREVACID than with the active control. A total of 711 patients were enrolled in the study, and 701 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years (median age 59 years), with 67% female patients and 33% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 87% Caucasian, 8% Black, 5% Other. There was no statistically significant difference between PREVACID 30 mg daily and the active control on symptom relief (i.e., abdominal pain) (Table 15) [see Indications and Usage (1.5)].

14.6	Risk Reduction of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer

In one large US, multicenter, double-blind, placebo- and misoprostol-controlled (misoprostol blinded only to the endoscopist) study in patients who required chronic use of an NSAID and who had a history of an endoscopically documented gastric ulcer, the proportion of patients remaining free from gastric ulcer at four, eight, and 12 weeks was significantly higher with 15 or 30 mg of PREVACID than placebo. A total of 537 patients were enrolled in the study, and 535 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 23 to 89 years (median age 60 years), with 65% female patients and 35% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, 4% Other. The 30 mg dose of PREVACID demonstrated no additional benefit in risk reduction of the NSAID-associated gastric ulcer than the 15 mg dose (Table 16) [see Indications and Usage (1.6)].

### Approaches to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in the high-risk patient [^cfd9dfb5]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are probably the most common cause of gastroduodenal injury in the United States today. Approximately half of patients who regularly take NSAIDs have gastric erosions, and 15%-30% have ulcers when they are examined endoscopically. However, the incidence of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) events caused by NSAIDs is much lower. Clinical upper GI events may occur in 3%-4.5% of patients taking NSAIDs, and serious complicated events develop in approximately 1.5%. However, the risk varies widely in relationship to clinical features such as history of ulcers or GI events, age, concomitant anticoagulant or steroid use, and NSAID dose. This review discusses the risks of clinical GI disease in NSAID users, the predictors of increased risk, and strategies for prevention of NSAID-associated GI disease.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### Acute NSAID-related transmural duodenitis and extensive duodenal ulceration [^9baa3197]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A 40-year-old previously healthy white man presented to the emergency department at American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, with severe upper abdominal pain of 36-hour duration. The pain started a few hours after the intake of a single tablet of tiaprofenic acid and became more intense after the intake of another tablet 24 hours later. He had no other symptoms. He had no prior upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, ulcer disease, steroidal or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, or ethanol intake. Physical examination revealed mild upper abdominal tenderness. Complete blood count, amylase, lipase, and liver function tests were unremarkable. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed marked thickening of the duodenal wall with surrounding mesenteric streaking. Upper GI endoscopy revealed extensive ulceration involving the duodenal bulb, apex, and proximal D2, as well as a few gastric erosions. Histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsy samples showed extensive epithelial cell necrosis and infiltration of the lamina propria with neutrophils and eosinophils. The patient responded well to rabeprazole 20 mg BID and remains well 5 months later.

Methods

We performed a literature search of PubMed for all English-language articles published between January 1970 and present (June 2007) using the key words tiaprofenic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAID, duodenitis, duodenal erosion, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, gastric erosion, gastric ulcer, or peptic ulcer. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials involving NSAIDs found using PubMed, with a focus on their GI adverse effects.

Results

Based on the PubMed search, there were no published reports of acute transmural duodenitis and complicated duodenal ulcers associated with short-term exposure to tiaprofenic acid or other NSAIDs. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability scale was used and a score of 6 was obtained, indicating a probable ADR from tiaprofenic acid use.

Conclusion

We report a patient who developed symptomatic severe transmural duodenitis and periduodenal mesenteric streaking, consistent with a complicated ulcer, probably associated with very short-term exposure to tiaprofenic acid.

### Acquired double pylorus secondary to a completely epithelialized gastroduodenal fistula [^faa51278]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old man underwent a gastroscopic reevaluation due to a prior history of gastric antral ulcers two years ago (Fig. 1 a). The carbon-13 urea breath test was negative. The patient had taken a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac sodium) and proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) periodically for back pain and ceased the NSAID six months ago. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed two pyloric channels that were communicating the gastric antrum with the duodenal bulb (Fig. 1 b, Video 1). The endoscope could be passed into the duodenum through either channel. The channel located on the side of the lesser curvature, although fully epithelialized, had failed to contract, suggesting an accessory pylorus (Fig. 2 a, b). This patient was clinically asymptomatic but at risk for ulcer recurrence, and endoscopic follow-up was continued.

Endoscopic images of gastric antral ulcer progression. a The ulcers on the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum two years prior. b These ulcers developed into an antroduodenal fistula with a larger size than the anatomic pylorus.

Fig. 2
Endoscopic view of antroduodenal fistula and anatomic pylorus. a The antroduodenal fistula was completely epithelialized. b Anatomic pylorus showed normal contractile function.

Double pylorus is generally an incidental finding with a reported endoscopic incidence of between 0.001% and 0.08%. It is rarely congenital, or more commonly acquired as a complication of a prepyloric, duodenal ulcer or gastric carcinoma that perforates the gastric and duodenal walls over time and creates an antroduodenal fistula. Most fistulas are located on the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum, followed by the posterior wall, greater curvature, and anterior wall. Some patients have a predisposing factor of ulcerogenic drug use or Helicobacter pylori infection. Multiple systemic diseases, such as diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may be associated with acquired double pylorus. The accessory orifice with an absence of normal contraction can cause reflux of duodenal contents. The natural history of the fistula is variable, with approximately 60% remaining patent and a few progressing to three pyloric ostia, spontaneous closure, or fusion into a large single pylorus. Double pylorus is usually treated conservatively and only in rare cases is surgical intervention required.

### Safety and efficacy of long-term esomeprazole 20 mg in Japanese patients with a history of peptic ulcer receiving daily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^8af931b2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, are common in Japan. For example, the prevalence of gonarthrosis or gonarthritis among women in Japan is 36–63%, depending on age, and some 320,000 Japanese individuals are affected by rheumatoid arthritis according to a 2002 survey. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective pain management for patients with such conditions, and are widely prescribed in Japan and other Asian countries.

While effective for relief of pain, the long-term use of NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) ranging from mild upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia to peptic ulcers, which can lead to life-threatening complications if the ulcers perforate or haemorrhage. A pooled analysis of 21 randomised, parallel-group studies of celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs, for example, identified GI symptoms (abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence) in 16% of patients taking celecoxib and around 20–24% of those taking diclofenac, ibuprofen or naproxen. With regard to the risk of peptic ulcers, a study of patients with osteoarthritis found that up to 17% of patients developed such lesions within 12 weeks of commencing treatment with non-selective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. This compares with a background incidence of 3.3% in a general population, based on a meta-analysis of the placebo treatment arms of 36 clinical trials of NSAIDs. Risk factors for upper GI events among NSAID users are numerous, and include older age, a history of previous GI events (e.g. bleeds) and use of higher NSAID doses.

Minimising the risk of potentially serious GI events in long-term NSAID users is clearly appropriate, especially for those patients at increased risk. The proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention of peptic ulcers and upper GI symptoms related to NSAID use in European, North American and Japanese patients, but few long-term studies have been conducted in the corresponding Japanese population. The present study therefore investigated the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg in Japanese patients with an endoscopically-confirmed history of peptic ulcer who were also receiving daily NSAID therapy. Efficacy of esomeprazole for prevention of peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms was also determined.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

GI risks of NSAIDs

Statement 4: NSAID use is associated with increased risk of adverse events throughout the entire GI tract; this is associated with substantial mortality. Level of Agreement: Strong Agreement (vote statement: a, 75.0%; b, 21.9%; c, 3.1%). Level of Evidence: A (vote grade: A, 87.5%; B, 12.5%).

The GI adverse effects of NSAIDs have been well documented in several studies, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. The majority of these studies have reported adverse events in the upper GI tract. The meta-analysis by Ofman et al. which reviewed severe upper GI complications in almost 800,000 patients taking oral NSAIDs for at least 4 days, showed an OR of 5.36 (95% CI, 1.79–16.1) from 16 RCTs (versus placebo), RR of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) from 9 cohort studies, and OR of 3.0 (95% CI, 2.5–3.7) from 23 case control studies for severe upper GI complications, which included perforations, clinically relevant ulcers, and bleeding.

Similarly, low-dose (≤ 325 mg daily) aspirin is associated with major upper GI bleeding: the RR was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6–2.7) in the meta-analysis by McQuaid and Laine and 2.6 (95% CI, 2.2–2.9) in the large Danish cohort study, carried out by Sørensen et al. Lanas et al. recently reported an OR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.27–1.90) and found that PPI use reduced the risk of major GI bleeding (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21–0.57).

A predictable and consistent GI blood loss has been shown in healthy volunteers taking ibuprofen (800 mg t.i.d.). Bleeding was observed in 27/31 subjects (87%) and averaged 4.5 to 5.0 mL/day (SD, 12; range, 0–65 mL/day) with an onset of 3 to 5 days after starting the drug.

NSAID-related upper- and lower-GI complications

Clinical significance

The extensive use of NSAIDs in prescriptions and by over-the-counter NSAID users has made GI complications a severe problem. These complications generally include bleeding gastric and/or duodenal ulcers, and to a lesser extent obstructions and/or perforations.NSAIDs can cause both upper- and lower-GI complications. Although the incidence of upper-GI mucosal damage has decreased over the years, due to the use of PPIs, lower-GI mucosal damage has been steadily increasing.

Although the risk of ulcer complications may decrease after the first few months of NSAID use, it still does not disappear with long-term therapy. Also, NSAID use is associated with heightened risks in some patients, and thus awareness of the risk factors and the use of preventive therapy for NSAID-related upper-GI injury is important. Table 1 highlights some of the GI complications associated with NSAID use.

Classification and diagnostic criteria

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognise that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present, but heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. FD is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic or metabolic disease.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy.FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation, and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) (table 1). Clinically, the EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning that is often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals. It is, however, recognised that patients with FD can have overlapping features of EPS and PDS, particularly in secondary and tertiary care.

Table 1
The Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia

It is important to note how diagnostic criteria for FD have evolved over time. The Rome Foundation has attempted to define the minimum thresholds for frequency and severity of each individual symptom more precisely. For example, in the latest iteration, Rome IV, the term 'bothersome' is used to describe symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Moreover, the Rome IV criteria for FD require PDS symptoms to occur three times per week, and for EPS symptoms to occur at least once per week. However, one of the more contentious issues when using the Rome IV criteria for FD in routine clinical practice is the requirement to have experienced symptoms for the last 3 months, with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

### Non-perforated peptic ulcer disease: multidetector CT findings, complications, and differential diagnosis [^f3e40bb8]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer haemorrhage

Bleeding is nowadays the most common PUD complication, which affects up to 15% of patients (incidence 19–57 cases/100.000 individuals/year) with NSAID use as key risk factor. Manifestations range from asymptomatic blood loss with positive faecal blood test, to melaena or haematemesis, to hypovolemic shock. Despite effective treatment, PUD-related haemorrhage tends to recur and up to 31% of patients will experience rebleeding within a month.

Albeit endoscopy remains the standard of care, as it allows both diagnosis and haemostasis, multidetector CT may prove useful in patients with suspected gastroduodenal bleeding. On preliminary unenhanced scans, dependent hyper attenuating debris from recent blood may be detected in the gastric fundus or duodenal lumen (Fig. 8). Blood products measure 30 to 45 Hounsfield units (HU), and the highest attenuation clot (45–70 HU) is generally found nearby the bleeding site. Caution should be paid to not misinterpret ingested material, medications, foreign bodies or residual contrast medium as blood, leading to falsely positive diagnosis.

Fig. 8
In an elderly 84-year-old male with haematemesis and melaena, precontrast CT scans (a) showed dilated second, third and fourth duodenum filled by hyper attenuating fluid (+) consistent with recent haemorrhage. Arterial-phase CT acquisition (b, c) showed characteristic appearance of antropyloric PUD with submucosal oedema (*) and mucosal hyperenhancement (thin arrow) but did not reveal signs of active bleeding, as confirmed by endoscopy

With help from focused MIP reformations, multidetector CT may allow direct identification of active haemorrhage as intraluminal "jet-like" or "blush" contrast extravasation at the bleeding site, isoattenuating with enhanced vessels (Figs. 9, and 10). In PUD, arterial bleeding may originate from the gastroduodenal artery, such as in duodenal ulcers, or from the left gastric artery in gastric ulcers along the lesser curvature, and in our experience is generally focal and subtle. Alternatively, CT may suggest different causes of digestive haemorrhage, such as tumour or varices.

14.5 Risk Reduction of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer

Two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in adult patients at risk of developing gastric and/or duodenal ulcers associated with continuous use of non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs. A total of 1,429 patients were randomized across the 2 studies. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 89 (median age 66 years) with 71% female, 29% male, 83% Caucasian, 5% Black, 4% Asian, and 8% Others. At baseline, the patients in these studies were endoscopically confirmed not to have ulcers but were determined to be at risk for ulcer occurrence due to their age (at least 60 years) and/or history of a documented gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. Patients receiving NSAIDs and treated with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg or 40 mg once daily experienced significant reduction in gastric ulcer occurrences relative to placebo treatment at 26 weeks. See Table 13. No additional benefit was seen with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg over esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg. Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily is not recommended regimen for the risk reduction of NSAID-associated gastric ulcer in adults. These studies did not demonstrate significant reduction in the development of NSAID-associated duodenal ulcer due to the low incidence.

### Extensive necrosis of duodenum after injection sclerotherapy of a bleeding duodenal ulcer with 5% ethanolamine [^29883502]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

We read with considerable interest the study of Konstantinidis et al about the use of ethanolamine 5% as injection therapy for bleeding peptic ulcer. Having experienced a severe complication induced by ethanolamine injection, we are concerned with the study's conclusion that injection treatment with ethanolamine is safe.

An 85-year-old man with a history of heart failure stage III, hypertension and recent diclofenac treatment for knee osteoarthritis, presented with hematemesis. Urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a relatively large ulcer with a non-bleeding visible vessel on the posterior wall near to the apex of duodenal bulb. Four mL of epinephrine solution (1:10000) plus 3 mL ethanolamine were injected in the four quadrants around the ulcer (epinephrine) and within the ulcer base (ethanolamine). Six hours later he developed severe upper abdominal pain and non-bloody vomiting. An abdominal x-ray showed free air under the diaphragms. Surgery demonstrated an extensive necrosis of distal antrum, bulb and second part of duodenum due to thrombosis of the gastroduodenal artery. He underwent a Whipple operation with uneventful course.

Despite the fact that sclerosants are described as safe and effective in treating bleeding ulcers, they may be associated with serious complications including perforation, necrosis, ulceration, vessel thrombosis and hemorrhage, leading to significant morbidity and one reported fatality. Moreover, four studies showed no advantage of using ethanolamine alone or in combination over using epinephrine alone.

Therefore, we believe that there is a limited role for sclerosants in light of other therapies with fewer associated complications.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

Ulcer bleeding — prevention of recurrent bleeding and antiplatelet management are summarized as follows: Prevention of recurrent bleeding is directed by the etiology of the bleeding ulcer, and H. pylori should be eradicated if present and after cure is documented, no further therapy is needed. NSAIDs should be stopped; if they must be continued a low-dose of a COX-2-selective NSAID plus a PPI should be used. Patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should start proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and generally have antiplatelet therapy restarted as soon as possible after bleeding ceases (ideally within 1–3 days and certainly within 7 days). Those with idiopathic ulcers should receive long-term antiulcer therapy.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^19f31541]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

Case3

An 82-year-old male patient was admitted with hematemesis. The patient had a history of osteoarthritis treated with NSAIDs and denied any prior biliary diseases. An emergent endoscopic examination revealed an anterior-bulb duodenal ulcer that did not respond to endoscopic treatment (Fig. 3 a). Subsequently, an emergency angiography was performed, but no positive findings were observed. Empirical gastroduodenal artery embolization was performed using gelatin sponge particles and coils, but rebleeding occurred, therefore, a repeat angiography was conducted. A pseudoaneurysm of the cystic artery was identified following super-selective catheterization of the cystic artery (Fig. 3 b). The pseudoaneurysm was successfully embolized with NBCA (Fig. 3 c). Ten days after the embolization, an endoscopic examination revealed that the ulcer had healed (Fig. 3 d). The patient was discharged without gallbladder infraction.

### Acid peptic disease in the elderly [^bf20a328]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

GERD and peptic ulcer disease are important diseases in the elderly. GERD presents similarly in the elderly and the young, although elderly patients may have less severe symptoms yet more severe mucosal disease and a higher prevalence of BE. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is falling, the elderly remain at risk for peptic ulcer because of the widespread use of NSAIDS. The presentation of peptic ulcer disease in the elderly can be subtle and atypical when compared with younger patients, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Because of comorbidity in the aged, peptic ulcer disease and its complications result in increased morbidity and mortality rates.

### Risk factors of poor prognosis and impairment of activities of daily living in patients with hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulcers [^bbb704ac]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

PPI use was identified as a risk factor of impairment of ADL. Most of the patients were prescribed PPI for the prevention of peptic ulcers caused by NSAIDs (21%) and antiplatelets (including aspirin) (47%) or due to a previous history of peptic ulcers (9%). A previous report showed that approximately 5% of patients with a history of ulcer bleeding who continued to take both NSAIDs and PPI still had recurrent ulcers after 6 months. Another study revealed that 19%–26% of patients with similar situations had endoscopically assessed gastroduodenal ulcers at 6 months, and the risk factors of ulcer recurrence included age ≥ 75 and comorbidity (heart diseases, stroke, cirrhosis, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, and diabetes). Thus, ulcer development as a result of NSAIDs under PPI treatment is not rare, and based on our results, such ulcers may result in poor clinical outcomes. Although the precise reasons are unknown, a possible risk of osteoporosis and dementia owing to taking PPIs may also be associated with the poor outcomes of PPI users. Moreover, the relatively low dose of PPIs in Japanese patients (e.g. esomeprazole 10–20 mg/day) could not sufficiently prevent the development of ulcers as a result of NSAIDs.

In the elderly, the locations of HGU (fundus and the posterior wall of the duodenum) were identified as independent risk factors of worse outcomes, but the presence of comorbidities was not. Localization on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb has been shown to be a risk factor for adverse outcome in bleeding peptic ulcers. Furthermore, the morbidity rate of fundus ulcers in elderly people is known to be higher than that in non-elderly people. The seriousness of ulcers or bleeding is likely to be associated with mortality for elderly patients. Indeed, Chow et al. reported that the risk of death was increased in elderly patients (age > 80) with features of severe bleeding (transfusion > 4 units, ulcer size > 2 cm, hematemesis, and melaena) at presentation. In this regard, the finding that Forrest IIb was the risk of overall mortality was of interest. Although patients with Forrest I or Forrest IIa ulcer always received endoscopic hemostasis, those with Forrest IIb did not. The difference in treatment strategy between the stages of ulcers might contribute to the result. The fact that comorbidities were not identified as a prognostic factor in the elderly is not surprising because most elderly patients have at least one comorbidity.

After observing the response to initial therapy with Ibuprofen tablets, thedose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient'sneeds. Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaintsoccur, administer Ibuprofen tablets with meals or milk.

Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups ofchronic disease:

Suggested Dosage: 1,200 mg to 3,200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg tid or qid). Individual patients may show a better responseto 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2,400 mg, although in well-controlledclinical trials patients on 3,200 mg did not show a better meanresponse in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3,200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinicalbenefits to offset potential increased risk. The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be loweredor raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiatingdrug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond. In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higherdoses of Ibuprofen tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.

The smallest dose of Ibuprofen tablets that yields acceptable controlshould be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationshipexists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for effects of food on rate of absorption).

The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment. In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with Ibuprofen tablets is sometimes seen in a few days to a week but most often isobserved by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has beenachieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted asrequired.

Mild to moderate pain:

400 mg every 4 to 6 hours as necessaryfor relief of pain. In controlled analgesic clinical trials, doses of Ibuprofen tabletsgreater than 400 mg were no more effective than the 400 mg dose.

Dysmenorrhea:

For the treatment of dysmenorrhea, beginningwith the earliest onset of such pain, Ibuprofen tablets should be given in adose of 400 mg every 4 hours as necessary for the relief of pain.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^72817ed8]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs

Potential GI side effects of NSAID therapy are a concern for physicians. Traditionally, adverse upper-GI-tract effects have been the focus, but there is increasing recognition that lower-GI complications are also an important issue.–Infection with Helicobacter pylori is also relevant and may be more common in some populations.– H. pylori infection increases the risk of GI complications during NSAID therapy, and eradication of H. pylori prior to commencing long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce GI risk.

Other risk factors for upper-GI-tract complications during NSAID therapy include older age (≥ 60 years), history of dyspepsia, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or oral anticoagulants, and a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. In the last few decades, mortality rates in patients with NSAID-associated upper-GI bleed or perforation have increased. Serious GI complications necessitating emergency surgery or hospitalization can occur without prior symptoms. Approximately 60%–80% of arthritis patients hospitalized or requiring surgery for serious GI complications during NSAID therapy report no previous GI symptoms. This highlights the need for a proactive approach to risk management, given that lack of symptoms makes it difficult to intervene before GI events become life-threatening.

Fig. 17
In a 53-year-old male with longstanding history of untreated duodenal ulcer, contrast-enhanced CT (a.c) revealed overdistended stomach (+) with fluid, normal-appearing gallbladder, minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation in left liver lobe and some air in peripheral intrahepatic ducts (arrows) without previous surgery or biliary intervention. The antropyloric tract showed oedematous submucosa (*) and enhancing mucosa (thin arrow in b), and closely adhered to the ventral aspect of pancreatic head, and a thin fluid-containing track suggesting fistulisation (arrowhead in c) was identifiable between proximal duodenum and distal choledochus. Endoscopy showed duodenal bulb deformation from chronic PUD without active ulcers, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was unsuccessful. During a bout of acute pancreatitis, repeated CT (d) confirmed choledocho-duodenal fistula (arrowhead). Prolonged medical therapy ultimately allowed resolution of symptoms [Adapted with permission from ref. no]

Fig. 18
A 78-year-old male with history of chronic NSAID use had initial contrast-enhanced CT (a, b) finding of circumferential thickening of pylorus and proximal duodenum with oedematous submucosa (*), enhancing mucosa (thin arrows) and posterior ulcer outpouching (arrows); ventrally, the normal-appearing gallbladder (+) was in contact with the affected duodenal bulb. Fifteen months later, the patient experienced melaena and abdominal pain: repeated CT (c, d) showed development of communication (arrowheads) between thickened duodenum (*) and contracted gallbladder (+) with intraluminal air and some dependent sludge or blood

CT consistently shows peripherally enhancing pancreatic abscesses (Fig. 16), which most commonly result from superinfection of post-necrotic collections following severe acute pancreatitis. Conversely, the presence of air-attenuation components and signs of severe gastro-duodenitis suggest the correct diagnosis of fistulising PUD, which is crucial to prevent failed laparoscopy. Open surgical treatment including gastric resection or duodenectomy is generally required.

### An unusual duodenal cloverleaf [^d33f6150]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

A 69-year-old female underwent an esophagog-astroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to a 6-month history of recurrent episode of vomiting. She had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for 20 years, and was under intermittent treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

On endoscopic examination, esophagus was normal, and stomach showed mild antral hyperemia. On the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, four pseudo-diverticula were found designing a kind of cloverleaf, with long white scars on the stalk of this pattern (Fig. 1). Rapid urease test was positive a diagnosis of complicated scars of healed Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive duodenal ulcer was posed, and the patient was successfully treated with H. pylori eradication regimen.

Figure 1
Four pseudo-diverticula located on the duodenal anterior wall and designing a kind of cloverleaf with long white scars on the stalk of this pattern

H. pylori infection is the most important cause of duodenal ulcer. Although its prevalence and incidence is currently decreasing in the western world, it is still able to cause complications.

Both H. pylori infection and NSAID use are currently identified as independent risk factors for the development of peptic ulcer disease and associated bleeding. Current guidelines advise H. pylori eradication before starting long-term NSAID treatment, whilst H. pylori eradication in those who are already long-term users is of no clear benefit. Treatment with maintenance proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for preventing NSAID-associated ulcers is advised too.

It is therefore hypothesized that the "duodenal cloverleaf" discovered in our patient may be the outcome of a complicated duodenal ulcer, associated with chronic H. pylori infection and worsened by long-term NSAID use without concurrent PPI gastroprotection.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (yosprala) [^d3da9b1c]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

YOSPRALA trials

Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) evaluated the omeprazole component by comparing the incidence of gastric ulcer formation in 524 patients randomized to YOSPRALA 325 mg/40 mg tablets and 525 patients randomized to EC-aspirin 325 mg. Patients were included with a cerebro- or cardiovascular diagnosis if they had been taking daily aspirin 325 mg for at least 3 months, were expected to require daily aspirin 325 mg therapy for at least 6 months and were over 55 years old. Subjects between 18 and 55 years old were also required to have a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. The majority of patients were male (71%) and white (90%). The majority (57%) of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Approximately 11% were also on chronic NSAID therapy.

Studies 1 and 2 showed that YOSPRALA given as 325 mg/40 mg tablets once daily statistically significantly reduced the 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg once daily. The results at one month, three months, and six months treatment are presented in Table 4.

In both trials, patients receiving YOSPRALA 325 mg/40 mg tablets had a statistically significantly lower 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg (3% vs. 12%).

Upper GI bleeding was reported as a serious adverse reaction in each treatment arm; 1 gastric ulcer hemorrhage in a subject receiving YOSPRALA and 1 duodenal ulcer hemorrhage in a subject receiving EC-aspirin alone.

### Non-perforated peptic ulcer disease: multidetector CT findings, complications, and differential diagnosis [^5f6ed2e7]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Epidemiology, pathogenesis and complications of peptic ulcer disease

Despite progressive eradication, over half of the world's population still harbours chronic HP infection, particularly in developing countries. Conversely the prevalence of PUD is lower (approximately 1.5% to 5%) in Europe and North America, where an increasing proportion (up to 46% of patients) of PUD cases is secondary to the widespread use of NSAIDs including low-dose aspirin. Since NSAIDs and HP result in additive risk, in Western countries PUD is increasingly encountered in elderly people (with a 1.5 male predominance), who usually suffer from lower degrees of abdominal pain compared to their younger counterparts. Other factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol intake may contribute to the risk of developing PUD. In 10% of cases the disease is idiopathic and unrelated to either HP or NSAID medications. Furthermore, PUD probably plays a role also in the pathogenesis of atrophic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Nowadays, albeit the more significant decrease has been in the duodenum, duodenal ulcers remain more common than their gastric counterparts.

Currently, digestive bleeding is by far the commonest complication, followed by perforation, gastric outlet obstruction and fistulisation, in descending order of frequency. Risk factors associated with development of PUD complications include male sex, advanced age, comorbidities, alcohol, smoking, NSAID use, anticoagulation, corticosteroids and immunosuppressant medications. Mortality increases with age and comorbidities, and is higher in patients without previous history of PUD.

### Cardioprotective aspirin users and their excess risk of upper gastrointestinal complications [^aecabb36]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Risk, relative risk, and excess risk estimates

To estimate absolute incidence rates within each risk subgroup, and based on pooled estimates from ours and others' original studies, we assumed the following: i) The overall baseline UGIC incidence rate is in the order of 1 per 1,000 person-years (pooled incidence rate = 0.99; 95%CI 0.84–1.18). ii) The incidence increases exponentially with age, from less than 1 per 1,000 person-years until the age of 60 to over 5 per 1,000 person-years at age 85 years. iii) Within age groups, the incidence rates among men are double those among women. iv) Regarding previous ulcer history, the relative risks used for past upper gastrointestinal pain/dyspepsia, uncomplicated and complicated ulcers were 2, 6, and 10, respectively. v) The relative risk associated with NSAIDs has been shown to be lower among patients with past ulcer history, even though the absolute risk is still higher among NSAID users with ulcer history. Briefly, exposure to NSAIDs causes over a fourfold increase in the risk of UGIC for patients without prior history (from 1 to 4 cases per 1,000 persons per year), and a greater than twofold increase in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (from 10 to 25 cases per 1,000 persons per year). Hence, the effect of NSAIDs on the risk of UGIC decreases proportionally with the severity of the prior gastrointestinal condition. However, patients with a history of complicated ulcer disease present the greatest absolute risk of UGIC when taking NSAIDs, that is, about 25 cases per 1,000 person-years, from which 15 cases could be attributable to NSAID treatment. The relative risks used for NSAID use were 2.5 in subjects with a past history of complicated or uncomplicated ulcer, 3 in subjects with past upper gastrointestinal pain, and 4 in subjects with no previous upper gastrointestinal complaint. vi) Low-dose aspirin doubles the risk of UGIC in each of these risk groups.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) refers to development of gastric or duodenal mucosal defects which penetrate through the muscularis mucosa. Until the end of the twentieth century, PUD represented a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since then, the availability of effective therapies, including H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors and Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication treatment, resulted in decreasing incidence of PUD. However, PUD continues to be a major global health issue that affects roughly 10% of the world population, due to the combined effect of persistent HP epidemics in low-income countries and of widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Patients affected by PUD may suffer from chronic symptoms such as dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort, nausea and early satiety, and often experience acute bouts of abdominal pain. Upper digestive endoscopy is definitely the mainstay diagnostic technique for PUD, but is invasive and often unfeasible in urgent conditions unless gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected. As a result, many patients with unknown PUD present to emergency departments with unexplained acute abdomen and commonly undergo multidetector CT. Since perforated gastroduodenal ulcers represent the commonest cause of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum, suggesting the underlying presence of PUD is relatively straightforward when radiologists are faced with upper abdominal free air or peritonitis without CT signs of colonic diverticulitis and digestive tract masses.

Conversely, due to the widespread belief that CT has no role in detecting uncomplicated PUD, most non-perforated ulcers are missed at primary CT interpretation. Unfortunately, unless clinical suspicion of PUD exists, endoscopy may not be performed for days or weeks after CT, thus allowing time for complications to develop. Albeit superficial ulcers are generally inconspicuous, careful multiplanar CT interpretation and attention to subtle mural and extraluminal signs may allow diagnosing non-perforated PUD prospectively. Suggesting the possibility of unexpected PUD may allow planning early endoscopy for diagnostic confirmation and timely start of appropriate treatment with nasogastric tube aspiration, intravenous fluids, and HP "triple therapy" eradication.

Therefore, this pictorial essay aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with CT appearances of non-perforated PUD. After an overview of the current epidemiology of PUD, we explain the appropriate multidetector CT acquisition and interpretation techniques. Then, the imaging findings of uncomplicated peptic disease, PUD-related digestive haemorrhage, gastric outlet obstruction and biliopancreatic fistulisation are presented with examples and a focus on their respective differential diagnoses.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^6f0eb876]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The Rome criteria

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would aid the physician greatly in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated, convincingly, that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and FD.

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology, and therefore encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional GI disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning, in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), and the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). EPS consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting; however, it should not fulfil biliary pain criteria. Postprandial epigastric bloating, belching, and nausea can also be present, but are not specific to dyspepsia. PDS is defined as bothersome postprandial fullness after normal-sized meals, or else early satiety that prevents someone finishing a regular-sized meal, with such episodes occurring at least several times per week. Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, belching, or nausea may also be present. But are not specific to dyspepsia. These definitions were determined based on a study of dyspeptic symptom groupings, and also on the fact that up to 80% of patients with dyspepsia report that their symptoms are made worse by eating.

### Medical versus surgical treatment for refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer [^08a3bba3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Refractory peptic ulcers are ulcers in the stomach or duodenum that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment or those that are associated with complications despite medical treatment. Recurrent peptic ulcers are peptic ulcers that recur after healing of the ulcer. Given the number of deaths due to peptic ulcer-related complications and the long-term complications of medical treatment (increased incidence of fracture), it is unclear whether medical or surgical intervention is the better treatment option in people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015 to identify randomised trials and non-randomised studies, using search strategies. We also searched the references of included studies to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing medical treatment with surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager 5 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We included only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago in the review. This study included 77 participants who had gastric ulcer and in whom medical therapy (histamine H2 receptor blockers, antacids, and diet) had failed after an average duration of treatment of 29 months. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. It appears that the participants did not have previous complications such as bleeding or perforation. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy while 40 participants received surgical therapy (antrectomy with or without vagotomy; subtotal gastrectomy with or without vagotomy; vagotomy; pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer; suture or closure of ulcer without vagotomy or excision of the ulcer; proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy alone; suture or closure of the ulcer with proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy). Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference. The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (2 out of 37; 5.4%) had gastric cancer, which was identified by repeated biopsy. They did not report the proportion of participants who had gastric cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of gastric cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (that is health-related quality of life (using any validated scale), adverse events and serious adverse events, peptic ulcer bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation, abdominal pain, and long-term mortality).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that provide the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies that evaluate the natural history of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers are urgently required to determine whether randomised controlled trials comparing medical versus surgical management in patients with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers or both are necessary. Such studies will also provide information for the design of such randomised controlled trials. A minimum follow-up of two to three years will allow the calculation of the incidence of complications and gastric cancer (in gastric ulcers only) in recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers. In addition to complications related to treatment and disease, health-related quality of life and loss of productivity should also be measured.

### Ischaemic gastric ulceration with endoscopic healing after revascularization [^99f2c571]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man with a history of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss was admitted for evaluation. Gastroscopy disclosed a severe gastric ulceration covering the lesser curvature. There was none of the usual risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and no malignancy was found. After 2 weeks' treatment with a proton pump inhibitor no healing was observed. The patient had a known atherosclerotic vascular disease, and angiography disclosed severe mesenteric ischaemia. After a revascularization procedure with stenting of the superior mesenteric artery was performed, the patient's symptoms disappeared. Healing of the gastric ulceration was observed at a further gastroscopy 2 weeks later. Chronic ischaemia is a rare cause of gastric ulcer, but should be suspected when no other cause is found and when the usual treatment with proton pump inhibitors does not result in healing.

Early surgical involvement in the management of a patient at high risk for recurrent bleeding, despite endoscopic intervention, is often optimal to assure continuity of care. Close collaboration of the surgical team with gastroenterologic endoscopy teams greatly benefits the patient. A detailed description of the location of the bleeding process is of great help for the surgeon as surgical decision making will be influenced by the distance from the gastroesophageal junction or pylorus, location on the anterior or posterior wall, greater or lesser curvature or incisura, and the size of the process.

### Dieulafoy's lesion of the duodenum: a comparative review of 37 cases [^6d1d8a95]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Dieulafoy's lesion is an abnormally large, tortuous, submucosal vessel that erodes the overlying epithelium without primary ulceration or erosion. The lesion predominantly occurs in the proximal stomach but it is also reported in extragastric sites. The pathogenesis and precipitating factors are poorly understood. Patients frequently present with gastrointestinal haemorrhage that can range from being self-limited to massive life threatening. Although there are no standard guidelines, endoscopy has significantly impacted the diagnosis and management. This review outlines our current understanding of the epidemiology of and risk factors for Dieulafoy's lesion of the duodenum, the pathophysiology of this disorder, and currently available approaches to diagnosis and management.

### Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of aetiology [^1064e507]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastroduodenal perforations

Gastric and duodenal perforations share similar causative mechanisms and clinical presentation. Patients with gastric or intraperitoneal duodenal perforation usually present with acute abdominal pain, guarding and rebound tenderness due to rapidly evolving chemical peritonitis caused by the effect of acidic/biliary/pancreatic contents on the peritoneal cavity. Immunosuppressed patients, including those treated with steroid drugs may present with non-specific symptomatology following contained or retroperitoneal perforation. MDCT can demonstrate gastric and duodenal perforation with an accuracy greater than 90%. Gas in the supramesocolic space indicates gastroduodenal perforation. Due to anatomic proximity, free gas bubbles in the lesser sac are indicative of perforation at the posterior gastric wall and at the duodenal bulb. Gas bubbles along the falciform ligament (falciform ligament sign) and in the intrahepatic fissure of ligamentum teres (ligamentum teres sign) are useful predictors of intraperitoneal gastroduodenal perforation. Pneumoperitoneum may range from abundant to absent. Perforation of the retroperitoneal duodenum characteristically causes pneumoretroperitoneum in the right anterior pararenal space. CT images should also be scrutinised for signs of oral contrast extravasation, focal thinning/discontinuity of the gastroduodenal wall, segmental wall thickening, perigastric or periduodenal fluid and adjacent fat stranding. Gas extending to the mediastinum may be encountered.

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) remains the leading cause of gastroduodenal perforation, followed by trauma, malignancy and iatrogenic injuries. Less common causes include inflammatory and ischemic conditions like mesenteric infarction, volvulus, intussusception and vasculitis.

Perforation is encountered in 5–20% of PUD cases, contributing to 70% of ulcer-related mortality. Associated risk factors include Helicobacter pylorii infection NSAIDs, acetylsalicylic acid, corticosteroids (Fig. 5), bevacizumab, stress, tobacco, alcohol abuse, and less commonly inflammatory bowel disease and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Ulcers along the anterior wall and curvatures perforate directly into the peritoneal space (Fig. 6), while ulcers along the posterior wall or duodenum tend to result in contained perforations. The gastric antrum and duodenal bulb are the most common perforation sites in ulcerative disease. Post-bulbar ulcers are rare (3–5%) and should raise suspicion for conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or Crohn's.

### Patient information: peptic ulcer disease… [^e3ca851f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori causes about 42% of peptic ulcers, although only 10% of people with H pylori develop a peptic ulcer. About 36% of peptic ulcers are associated with use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ketorolac. In addition, cigarette smoking, psychological stress, family history of peptic ulcer disease, and adverse childhood circumstances such as crowded living conditions and poor water quality can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Some people with peptic ulcer disease have no symptoms, but about 81% of people with peptic ulcers have upper abdominal pain or discomfort, called dyspepsia. With duodenal ulcers, the abdominal pain may improve immediately after eating but typically worsens 2 to 3 hours later. Heartburn or acid regurgitation occurs in about 46% of people with peptic ulcers, and 29% have bleeding ulcers.

Complications of peptic ulcer disease include gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to vomiting blood; obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the stomach and causes abdominal pain, bloating, and recurrent vomiting; and ulcer perforation, which causes sudden, severe pain and can lead to shock and death if not treated with emergency surgery. The primary treatment for peptic ulcer disease is use of a proton pump inhibitor drug such as omeprazole or lansoprazole to decrease stomach acid and allow the lining of the stomach or duodenum to heal. Most ulcers heal within 4 weeks, but those larger than 2 cm may take 8 weeks to resolve. Antacids are appropriate only for temporary symptom relief. Patients with H pylori infection should receive a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, and up to 3 antibiotics, which are selected based on patterns of H pylori resistance in the local area.

For patients who develop a peptic ulcer due to use of an NSAID, stopping that medication leads to healing of ulcers in 95% of cases. For individuals with peptic ulcer disease who need to continue taking an NSAID, options to reduce their ulcer risk include switching from an oral to a topical NSAID, using a different type of NSAID, or adding a proton pump inhibitor.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison of the incidence of endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcer rates with valdecoxib or naproxen in healthy subjects aged 65 to 75 years [^bf0e5982]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Compared with nonselective NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors have been associated with a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (in short-term endoscopic studies) and ulcer complications (in long-term trials).

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of valdecoxib 20 mg BID and naproxen 500 mg BID, administered for 6.5 days, on the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) mucosa of healthy older subjects (aged 65–75 years) as assessed by UGI endoscopy.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, active-comparator, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, eligible subjects who were free of NSAID or COX-2-selective inhibitor use for 2 weeks and who had normal UGI mucosa (mucosal grading score of 0, based on endoscopic evaluation of both the stomach and duodenum) were randomized. Serologic testing for Helicobacter pylori antibodies was conducted at baseline. No antiulcer medications were permitted. The primary end point was the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (gastric or duodenal mucosal grading score of 7, as indicated by any lesion with unequivocal depth ≥ 3 mm in diameter) after 6.5 days of blinded treatment with valdecoxib, naproxen, or placebo. Secondary end points were incidence of gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastroduodenal erosions/ulcers, and the incidence of ≥ 11 gastroduodenal erosions/ulcers. All documented adverse events were self-reported by subjects or were observed by investigators.

Results

Sixty-one patients were randomized to receive valdecoxib, 60 to naproxen, and 60 to placebo. Mean (SD) subject age was 68.8 (3.25) years in the valdecoxib group, 68.6 (2.76) years in the naproxen group, and 68.6 (3.14) years in the placebo group (P = NS). In the valdecoxib and naproxen groups, 47.5% and 58.3% of subjects were female, respectively, compared with 56.7% of the placebo group (P = NS). Valdecoxib and placebo were associated with significantly lower incidences of gastroduodenal ulcers than naproxen (1.6% [1 gastroduodenal ulcer/61 patients] and 1.7% [1/59], respectively, vs 22.0% [13/59]; P < 0.001). Compared with naproxen, both valdecoxib and placebo were associated with significantly lower incidences of gastric (1.6% [1/61] and 1.7% [1/59] vs 15.3% [9/59]; both, P < 0.03) and duodenal ulcers (0% [0/61] and 0% [0/59] vs 8.5% [5/59]; both, P < 0.03). In all cases, the incidence of ulcers with valdecoxib was not significantly different from placebo. Results were similar for any erosions/ulcers, and when analyzed by H pylori status. The number of adverse events was low in each group.

Conclusion

In these healthy older subjects (aged 65–75 years), valdecoxib 20 mg BID was associated with a significantly lower rate of gastroduodenal, gastric, and duodenal ulcers than naproxen 500 mg BID, even after 6.5 days of therapy.

Maintenance of Healed Duodenal Ulcer

The recommended oral dosage for adults is 150 mg once daily at bedtime.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

The recommended oral dosage in adults for the treatment of erosions, ulcerations, and associated heartburn is 150 mg twice daily.

Active Benign Gastric Ulcer

The recommended oral dosage is 300 mg given either as 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily at bedtime. Prior to treatment, care should be taken to exclude the possibility of malignant gastric ulceration.

Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Moderate to Severe Renal Insufficiency

The dose for patients with renal dysfunction should be reduced as follows:

Some elderly patients may have creatinine clearances of less than 50 mL/min, and, based on pharmacokinetic data in patients with renal impairment, the dose for such patients should be reduced accordingly. The clinical effects of this dosage reduction in patients with renal failure have not been evaluated.

### Management of massive peptic ulcer bleeding [^6ee89f42]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Massive bleeding from a peptic ulcer remains a challenge. A multidisciplinary team of skilled endoscopists, intensive care specialists, experienced upper gastrointestinal surgeons, and intervention radiologists all have a role to play. Endoscopy is the first-line treatment. Even with larger ulcers, endoscopic hemostasis can be achieved in the majority of cases. Surgery is clearly indicated in patients in whom arterial bleeding cannot be controlled at endoscopy. Angiographic embolization is an alternate option, particularly in those unfit for surgery. In selected patients judged to belong to the high-risk group — ulcers 2 cm or greater in size located at the lesser curve and posterior bulbar duodenal, shock on presentation, and elderly with comorbid illnesses — a more aggressive postendoscopy management is warranted. The optimal course of action is unclear. Most would be expectant and offer medical therapy in the form of acid suppression. Surgical series suggest that early elective surgery may improve outcome. Angiography allows the bleeding artery to be characterized, and coil embolization of larger arteries may further add to endoscopic hemostasis. The role of early elective surgery or angiographic embolization in selected high-risk patients to forestall recurrent bleeding remains controversial. Prospective studies are needed to compare different management strategies in these high-risk ulcers.

### Magnitude, outcome, and predictors of mortality in perforated peptic ulcer disease: a retrospective study in jigjiga town, Ethiopia [^1a1b851f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a significant global health issue due to its high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. It affects 4 million people worldwide annually, and the incidence of PUD has been estimated to be around 1.5–3%. It is a surgical emergency and life-threatening complication that affects around 2–10% of patients with peptic ulcer disease. And accounts for more than 70% of deaths associated with PUD. Perforation is often the first clinical presentation of PUD. Perforations typically occur in the anterior wall of the duodenum (60%), followed by the antrum (20%) and lesser curvature of the stomach (20%). Patients with perforated PUD often present with an acute abdomen that carries high morbidity and mortality.

There is a geographical difference in the etiology and risk factors of perforated PUD, reflecting variation in socioeconomic development. In the developing world, the patients are males and young, with a strong association with cigarette smoking. In contrast, patients in the developed world tend to be elderly, with a strong association with ulcerogenic drug ingestion. Moreover, the etiology and risk factors also include the use of NSAIDs, steroids, alcohol, H.pylori, cigarette smoking, and previous peptic ulcer disease. There are also some local risk factors in the region, such as kha t, which is common in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Defining the exact etiological factor in any patient may often be difficult, as multiple risk factors may be present, and they tend to interact.

The most common presenting symptom was sudden onset of abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention and almost all patients have abdominal tenderness. Around 31% have been reported to have a previous history of dyspepsia. While others report up to 69% have had a previous history of dyspepsia and previous treatment of peptic ulcer disease. The diagnosis of perforated PUD is clinical which is based on a high index of suspicion in a condition with acute exacerbation of a patient with known peptic ulcer disease and can be investigated with erect chest x-ray in which the presence of free air under the right diaphragm (pneumo-peritonium) clinches the diagnosis. This sign is present in 65–80% of the cases. Using lateral erect chest X-rays increases the detection of pneumoperitonium by up to 98%.

### Non-perforated peptic ulcer disease: multidetector CT findings, complications, and differential diagnosis [^5fe406ca]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Particularly in the elderly, the key differential diagnosis of gastric or duodenal mural thickening is malignant tumours. Neoplastic mural thickening is typically focal, nodular or mass-forming rather than diffuse, often measures over 1 cm, shows uniformly soft-tissue attenuation rather than layered enhancement pattern (Fig. 6), and may infiltrate the surrounding fat. Albeit deep ulcerations which protrude into a solid mass strongly suggest cancer, to overlapping CT appearances (Fig. 6 e, f) endoscopy is generally required for diagnostic confirmation.

Fig. 6
Differentiation of gastric tumours from PUD. In a 45-year-old HIV-positive male with wasting syndrome, CT (a) with oral water (+) showed localized, enhancing mural thickening at distal gastric antrum (thin arrows). In a 67-year-old male, CT (b… d) revealed distended gastric fundus (+) with residual contrast from previous fluoroscopic study, contracted antrum with mucosal enhancement (thin arrows) and hypoattenuating mural thickening (*); multiplanar image review revealed shouldering at transition between abnormal wall and upstream gastric body (in c) and eccentric, nodular-shaped thickening (in d) with subtle infiltration of perigastric fat, consistent with endoscopic diagnosis of stomach cancer. In a 44-year-old female, diffuse signet-ring gastric carcinoma (linitis plastica) showed CT (e, f) appearance of asymmetrically thickened, hypoattenuating wall (*) with irregular, enhancing mucosal thickening (thin arrows) and a focal posterior ulceration (arrow in e)

Finally, ulcer outpouchings should be differentiated from duodenal diverticula, which are not uncommon in the elderly population, often asymptomatic, and typically located medially, at the transition between descending and horizontal portions (Fig. 7).

Pancreatitis is the most common inflammatory process that can affect the duodenum. Severe pancreatitis can lead to duodenal involvement through two mechanisms: the first is direct damage to the duodenal wall by an inflammatory reaction (mural edema or hematoma from disruption of the intramural vasculature) (Fig. 13), and the second is a fibrotic reaction due to compression by pseudocysts or by an enlarged pancreatic head. Pancreatic inflammatory fluid collections and pseudocysts develop in up to 50% of patients with acute pancreatitis. CT shows displacement and extrinsic compression of the descending duodenum without mucosal abnormalities secondary to a well-defined fluid collection with low attenuation (< 15 HU) surrounded by a peripheral fibrous capsule (Fig. 14). Higher attenuation values are indicative of a superimposed infection, necrotic tissue, or intracystic haemorrhage.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (aspirin and omeprazole delayed-release tab) [^c602c0f5]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA trials

Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) evaluated the omeprazole component by comparing the incidence of gastric ulcer formation in 524 patients randomized to ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg tablets and 525 patients randomized to EC-aspirin 325 mg. Patients were included with a cerebro- or cardiovascular diagnosis if they had been taking daily aspirin 325 mg for at least 3 months, were expected to require daily aspirin 325 mg therapy for at least 6 months and were over 55 years old. Subjects between 18 and 55 years old were also required to have a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. The majority of patients were male (71%) and white (90%). The majority (57%) of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Approximately 11% were also on chronic NSAID therapy.

Studies 1 and 2 showed that ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA given as 325 mg/40 mg tablets once daily statistically significantly reduced the 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg once daily. The results at one month, three months, and six months treatment are presented in Table 4.

In both trials, patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg tablets had a statistically significantly lower 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg (3% vs. 12%).

Upper GI bleeding was reported as a serious adverse reaction in each treatment arm; 1 gastric ulcer hemorrhage in a subject receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA and 1 duodenal ulcer hemorrhage in a subject receiving EC-aspirin alone.

METHODS

Study design

GI outcomes were evaluated in patients with osteoarthritis in need of daily NSAIDs (i.e. using celecoxib or nsNSAIDs) as a result of chronic pain, at moderate GI risk (defined as aged ≥ 55 years), who were treated in a manner typical of US clinical patient care in 783 primary care and specialty practices. We hypothesized celecoxib would be associated with lower incidences of clinically significant upper and/or lower GI events compared with nsNSAIDs, with or without PPIs. Aspirin users were excluded to select a population with lower cardiovascular risk and to determine whether celecoxib has a greater GI benefit than nsNSAIDs, without the confounding use of aspirin. It has been reported that in patients taking COX-2 selective NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin, the GI advantages of COX-2 selective NSAIDs were reduced.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^3f35ff34]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease is common with a lifetime prevalence in the general population of 5–10% and an incidence of 0.1–0.3% per year. Peptic ulceration occurs due to acid peptic damage to the gastro-duodenal mucosa, resulting in mucosal erosion that exposes the underlying tissues to the digestive action of gastro-duodenal secretions. This pathology was traditionally related to a hypersecretory acid environment, dietary factors and stress. However, the increasing incidence of the Helicobacter pylori infection, the extensive use of NSAIDs, and the increase in alcohol and smoking abuse have changed the epidemiology of this disease. Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30 years, complications are still encountered in 10–20% of these patients. Complications of peptic ulcer disease include perforation and bleeding and improvement in medical management has made obstruction from chronic fibrotic disease a rare event. A recent review on the epidemiology of complicated peptic ulcer disease found that hemorrhage was by far the most common complication of peptic disease, with a reported annual incidence of hemorrhage in the general population ranging from 0.02 to 0.06%, with sample size-weighted average 30-day mortality of 8.6%. Reported annual incidence of perforation ranges from 0.004 to 0.014%, with sample size-weighted average 30-day mortality of 23.5%. Although perforation is less common, with a perforation:bleeding ratio of approximately 1:6, it is the most common indication for emergency operation and causes about 40% of all ulcer-related deaths.

Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy and timely surgical/radiological treatment.

### Pathophysiology of duodenal ulcer disease [^59b70c61]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Before the discovery of Helicobacter pylori infection some 12 years ago, three major disturbances in gastric physiology had been identified in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. These abnormalities were: impaired acid inhibition of gastrin release from the antral mucosa, increased basal and stimulated acid secretion by the body of the stomach and increased acid load in the duodenum. Some of these abnormalities in gastric function can now be explained by the effects of H. pylori infection. The increased release of gastrin by the antral mucosa in duodenal ulcer patients, for example, can be entirely explained by the effects of this organism. Other abnormalities, however, appear to have a genetic basis or may be due to environmental factors. Much work has been conducted on the relationship between H. pylori and the development of duodenal ulcer disease, and this paper aims to review recent studies in the field and to give an overview of the latest understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease.

### A randomized, controlled comparison of ibuprofen at the maximal over-the-counter dose compared with prescription-dose celecoxib on upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury [^d13cd72c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Ibuprofen is a well-tolerated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), particularly at over-the-counter (OTC) doses. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-selective inhibitors cause less ulceration than prescription-dose nonselective NSAIDs. We compared endoscopic injury related to nonprescription ibuprofen doses with celecoxib, also comparing prescription doses of naproxen with placebo as a positive control.

Methods

The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, double-dummy endoscopic evaluation with concealed allocation. A 2-way crossover with a 4-5-week washout period was used. Participants were healthy adults with normal baseline findings from endoscopy. Ninety-five subjects were randomly assigned, and 79 subjects completed both study phases. Age distribution was reflective of the target population of the OTC agent. Twenty percent were infected with Helicobacter pylori, and 79% and 67% had a current or past medical problem, respectively. Qualifying subjects, stratified by the presence or absence of H. pylori infection (n = 20), were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 sequences (phase I/II) as follows: ibuprofen/celecoxib; celecoxib/ibuprofen, naproxen/placebo, or placebo/naproxen. Primary end points were the frequency of endoscopic ulcers and erosions in the groups administered: (1) celecoxib vs. ibuprofen and (2) naproxen vs. placebo.

Results

In celecoxib-treated subjects, 2.6% developed ulcers compared with 17.9% of those treated with ibuprofen (P = 0.056). Naproxen treatment was associated with a significantly greater ulceration rate compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Short-term use of the nonselective COX inhibitors ibuprofen and naproxen is associated with a greater risk for endoscopic mucosal injury compared with the COX-2-selective inhibitor celecoxib or placebo. A prospective analysis appropriately powered to address the incidence of clinically significant gastroduodenal ulceration associated with the short-term use of these agents would be required to further define the clinical relevance of these findings.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^2dcc3850]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

NSAID ulcers — secondary prevention after healing: In patients restarted on NSAIDs after ulcer healing, maintenance proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy reduced recurrent ulcer bleeding at 6 months versus H. pylori therapy only (4.4 vs. 18.8%; NNT = 7). At 6 months, recurrent bleeding was 4.9% with celecoxib and 6.4% with diclofenac plus PPI, with recurrent ulcers on endoscopy in 19 and 26% of patients. In a subsequent 12-month double-blind study comparing celecoxib plus twice-daily PPI versus celecoxib plus placebo, recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred in 0 vs. 8.9% (NNT = 12). Patients who must remain on NSAIDs should receive a COX-2-selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose plus PPI therapy.

AGA upper gastrointestinal biopsy for dyspepsia — scope and definitions — presents recommendations on the role of biopsy to evaluate dyspepsia in the absence of mucosal lesions, focusing on adult patients (ie, older than 18 years of age) undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for dyspepsia as the sole indication, with dyspepsia defined by Rome III as 1 or more of bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning, and assuming no prior treatment for Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. For normal-appearing mucosa, it notes that currently there are no clinical standards or guidelines for performing such biopsies, and that endoscopic biopsy was assumed to be associated with a negligible rate of complications. The guideline uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and was developed based primarily on Western populations, acknowledging that certain non-Western populations might warrant a risk-tailored management approach.

### Perforated pyloroduodenal peptic ulcer and sonography [^bfb2d842]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the spectrum of sonographic findings in perforated pyloroduodenal peptic ulcer and discuss the potential role of sonography in the diagnosis.

Conclusion

Although sonography is not the first-line investigation of choice in suspected perforated peptic ulcer, understanding of the characteristic appearances seen during general abdominal sonography may aid the reader in the diagnosis of this important and sometimes overlooked cause of nonspecific abdominal pain. This may shorten time to the diagnosis and ultimate surgical management.

### Reducing NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complications [^b626fc03]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Around 17 million items for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed annually in England alone.1 These drugs are associated with upper gastrointestinal complications.2 For example, each year, NSAIDs cause about 3,500 hospitalisations for, and 400 deaths from, ulcer bleeding in people aged 60 years or above.3 Aspirin, even in low doses, is also associated with gastrointestinal complications.4 5 Here we assess strategies for reducing gastrointestinal complications induced by NSAIDs, including aspirin and selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (coxibs).

### Differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding proximal to the ligament of trietz [^622bee63]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is an important medical problem for patients and the medical system. The causes of UGIB are varied and their accurate identification guides appropriate management. The major cause of UGIB is peptic ulcer disease, for which Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use are major risk factors. Lesser causes include Dieulafoy lesion, gastric antral vascular ectasia, hemobilia, aortoenteric fistulas, and upper gastrointestinal tumors. Awareness of causes and management of UGIB should allow physicians to treat their patients more effectively.

Duodenal ulcer on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb

Double pylorus is a rare anomaly found in less than 0.4% of upper endoscopies. It is seen twice as often in males when compared with females. Frequently, it is a complication of peptic ulcer disease, resulting from penetration of the peptic ulcer and the creation of a fistula between the duodenal bulb and the prepyloric antrum. Occasionally it may be congenital or secondary to gastric carcinoma. The location of the second duct is commonly in the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum, near the anatomic pylorus. Similarly, our patient's endoscopic findings indicated that the second duct was acquired and originated from the ulcer located in duodenal bulb, penetrating the prepyloric antrum.

In most cases, as in our patient, this abnormality itself tends to be clinically silent. It is mostly found incidentally by endoscopic or X-ray examination. In our case, the presenting symptom was gastrointestinal bleeding from the gastric ulcers, a condition rarely reported in the literature. A long history of treatment with drugs including corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also prohibit healing, contributing to fistula formation. Our patient's previous medication included salicylic acid.

Treatment with anti-ulcer medication must be rapidly performed. The majority of patients respond well to conservative treatment for peptic ulcers, regardless of whether the fistula remains open or is spontaneously closed. In general, surgical intervention is not a choice of treatment, although it should be considered for patients with refractory symptoms, recurrent ulcers, and other complications, even in those taking strong anti-ulcer medication. Spontaneous fusion of both ducts (real pylorus and pseudopylorus) only occurs in a small percentage of patients. Endoscopic treatment is also feasible using a biliary sphincterotomy.

In conclusion, we would like to share an unusual case presenting with gastric ulcer bleeding who had a fistula originating from the duodenal bulb ulcer coincidentally seen during endoscopy.

### Gastric irritation effect of COX inhibitors vs. NSAIDs… [^bbbcb77a]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The adverse gastrointestinal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are well known. In patients who take NSAIDs regularly, upper endoscopic examinations have shown a 15 to 30 percent prevalence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. A new class of anti-inflammatory medications has recently been introduced, called cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Selective COX-2 inhibitors may therefore relieve the pain of inflammation without deleterious effects on gastrointestinal mucosa. Laine and associates performed a randomized trial comparing the effect of a COX-2–specific inhibitor with that of ibuprofen on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoarthritis. A total of 742 patients with osteoarthritis was randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, ibuprofen or placebo. Patients who had evidence of an ulcer on initial endoscopy were excluded.

An ulcer was defined as the presence of a mucosal lesion of 3 mm or more. The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers with rofecoxib therapy was significantly lower than with ibuprofen therapy and was equivalent to placebo. Specifically, ulcers were seen at 12 weeks in 9. 9 percent of patients taking placebo,
4. 1 percent taking rofecoxib at 25 mg per day, 7. 3 percent taking rofecoxib at 50 mg per day, and
27. 7 percent taking ibuprofen. The authors then calculated the number-needed-to-treat. At a dosage of 25 mg per day of rofecoxib over six months of treatment, 2. 8 patients would need to be treated with rofecoxib rather than ibuprofen to avert the development of an ulcer in one patient. editor's note: This study confirms the lower rate of gastroduodenal ulcers in patients taking a COX-2 inhibitor. This study did not compare other commonly used NSAIDs or nonacetylated salicylates on the rate of ulcer formation.

While it was not the objective of the study to assess analgesic efficacy, it appears that there was no difference between rofecoxib and ibuprofen in this regard.

Fistulisation

Contrary to intraperitoneal perforation, which causes free peritonitis in the abdominal cavity, posterior duodenal ulcers may occasionally penetrate into the retroperitoneum or fistulise to adjacent organs such as the pancreas (Fig. 16), common bile duct (Fig. 17), gallbladder (Fig. 18) or liver. Clinical manifestations of retroperitoneal infections may be either hyperacute (epigastric pain and tenderness, fever) or insidious (abdominal or back pain, malaise weight loss). Leukocytosis and elevation of acute phase reactants, serum amylase, lipase and hepatic transaminases are generally observed.

Fig. 16
In an 84-year-old male with malaise, appetite loss, epigastric tenderness and protracted low-grade fever, contrast-enhanced CT detected a vast retroperitoneal abscess (+) with some internal gas and residual enhancing pancreatic parenchyma at body and tail, which was indissociable from the distal gastric antrum and pylorus: the latter showed circumferential mural thickening with oedematous submucosa (*) and hyperenhancing mucosa (thin arrows). Additionally, focal communication (arrowheads in c, d) was identified between pancreatic abscess and inflamed digestive tract. The fistulisation site corresponded to endoscopic finding (image in inset d) of large posterior bulbar ulcer. Laparotomic surgery required extensive dissection, confirmed a vast, stinky purulent and necrotic collection, fixed to the stomach and deformed pylorus, and was completed with gastric resection and Billroth-II gastrojejunostomy. Pathology confirmed severe transmural ulcerated peptic gastro-duodenitis, without malignant changes [Adapted from Open Access ref. no]

### Nabumetone [^b09f69f6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.
