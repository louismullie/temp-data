## Question

Faint wheezes in LLB IN HEART FAILURE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of faint wheezes in the left lower lung base (LLB) in heart failure, including mechanism, prevalence, diagnostic implications, and how to distinguish them from other causes of wheezing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of wheeze in heart failure and whether it reflects bronchospasm versus airway edema. Then, I should verify how common wheeze is in acute heart failure and whether it localizes to the bases. Next, I will review the diagnostic value and limitations of auscultation, including interobserver variability. After that, I need to check which accompanying signs and tests increase the likelihood of heart failure when wheeze is present. Finally, I will consider key differentials and outline a practical, evidence-based approach to evaluation and management, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and high-quality studies.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. In heart failure, pulmonary venous hypertension leads to peribronchial interstitial edema and airway wall thickening, which narrows airway caliber and increases resistance, producing wheeze; this is often termed "cardiac asthma" and reflects non-asthmatic bronchospasm or turbulent flow rather than primary airway disease, and end-expiratory wheezes may indicate bronchospasm in this context [^826ecb2f] [^2d1035b4] [^c31deb26].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence and distribution. Wheezing is not rare in acute heart failure; contemporary data suggest wheeze in roughly 30% of cases, and although wheeze is classically described as diffuse, it can be heard focally, including at the lung bases, depending on the distribution of edema and airway narrowing. Thus, faint wheezes in the LLB can still be consistent with heart failure physiology, especially when other congestive features are present [^7eeeb390] [^c31deb26].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic specificity. I need to check the reliability of auscultation. Interobserver agreement for wheeze is variable, with studies showing kappa values ranging from poor to excellent depending on methodology and training; this means that auscultation alone cannot reliably distinguish cardiac wheeze from obstructive lung disease, and clinicians often overcall or undercall wheeze, particularly when mixed adventitious sounds are present [^1cdec914] [^4afb4aa0] [^20d9beb6].

> Next, I should review which accompanying findings increase the likelihood that wheeze reflects heart failure. Let me consider the bedside features with the strongest diagnostic weight: elevated jugular venous pressure, a third heart sound, peripheral edema, and pulmonary rales substantially raise the probability of heart failure. In the ED literature, an S3 gallop has a positive likelihood ratio around 11, and pulmonary venous congestion on chest radiograph around 12, while the absence of rales lowers the probability, underscoring that wheeze in isolation is insufficient [^896d3544] [^d855c5a2].

> I will now examine how to integrate objective testing when wheeze is present. Chest radiography is recommended in suspected or new-onset heart failure to assess cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion and to identify alternative diagnoses; natriuretic peptides markedly improve diagnostic accuracy, with BNP less than 100 pg/mL providing a strong negative likelihood ratio for heart failure; lung ultrasound can rapidly detect B-lines and pleural effusions, outperforming auscultation for pulmonary congestion in acute settings; and echocardiography confirms structural or functional cardiac abnormalities when heart failure is suspected [^7056ffdd] [^896d3544] [^4cf461a1] [^a257161a].

> But wait, what if the wheeze is not cardiac. I should double-check the differential. COPD and asthma frequently coexist with heart failure and can produce wheeze that obscures crackles; pulmonary embolism, endobronchial obstruction, and vocal cord dysfunction can also present with wheeze; in older adults, age-related crackles are common and can confound interpretation, so I need to correlate with history, risk factors, and imaging rather than relying on a single auscultatory finding [^7eeeb390] [^b1aee67a] [^f3586a34].

> Let me think about a practical approach. If I hear faint wheezes in the LLB in a patient with dyspnea, I should immediately look for congestive signs such as JVP, S3, edema, and orthopnea; obtain a chest radiograph and natriuretic peptide; and consider lung ultrasound if available. If these support heart failure, I should treat with diuretics, vasodilators as indicated, and continue guideline-directed medical therapy, recognizing that classic asthma medications are not effective for cardiac wheeze. If the pretest probability is low or alternative diagnoses are likely, I should pivot to spirometry, CT, or other targeted testing rather than anchoring on wheeze alone [^7056ffdd] [^89c733bd] [^896d3544].

> In summary, I should confirm that faint wheezes in the LLB can reflect heart failure via peribronchial edema and airway narrowing, occur in a meaningful minority of acute heart failure cases, and carry limited diagnostic specificity on their own. Their significance rises when integrated with congestive signs, chest radiography, natriuretic peptides, and echocardiography, and they should be distinguished from obstructive lung disease and other wheezing etiologies through careful clinical correlation and appropriate testing [^826ecb2f] [^7eeeb390] [^896d3544] [^7056ffdd].

Faint wheezes in the left lower lung base (LLB) in heart failure reflect **bronchial narrowing from peribronchial edema** and fluid accumulation, producing a high-pitched, musical sound on expiration [^c31deb26] [^414715d9]. They are a recognized but nonspecific finding in heart failure, often coexisting with crackles and an S3, and are more common in acute decompensation or when the left lower lobe is preferentially affected by congestion [^d855c5a2] [^7eeeb390]. Faint wheezes alone are not diagnostic and must be interpreted with **JVP, edema, CXR, and natriuretic peptides** to confirm heart failure and exclude asthma or COPD [^896d3544] [^7056ffdd].

---

## Pathophysiology of faint wheezes in heart failure

Faint wheezes in heart failure arise from **peribronchial edema** and fluid accumulation that narrow small- and medium-sized airways, increasing airflow resistance and generating turbulent, high-pitched sounds on expiration [^c31deb26] [^414715d9]. This mechanism is distinct from primary airway disease (asthma/COPD) and reflects transient, congestion-related bronchial compromise that may improve with decongestion [^826ecb2f].

---

## Clinical significance of faint wheezes in the left lower lung base

- **Localization**: Faint wheezes in the LLB suggest preferential congestion in the left lower lobe, which can occur due to gravity, regional lymphatics, or asymmetric pulmonary vascular pressures.

- **Association with severity**: Wheezes are more common in acute decompensated heart failure and may coexist with crackles, S3, and elevated JVP, indicating higher filling pressures and fluid overload [^d855c5a2] [^7eeeb390].

- **Nonspecificity**: Wheezes are not specific to heart failure and can be seen in asthma, COPD, or infection; thus, they must be interpreted in clinical context and with supportive findings [^1f7ad5f6] [^b1aee67a].

---

## Diagnostic implications and differentiation

Faint wheezes in the LLB should prompt evaluation for heart failure, but **cannot alone establish the diagnosis**. Key discriminators include:

| **Clinical feature** | **Heart failure** | **Asthma/copd** |
|-|-|-|
| History | - Orthopnea <br/> - PND <br/> - Fluid overload | - Chronic cough <br/> - Smoking <br/> - Allergy |
| Exam | - Elevated JVP <br/> - Edema <br/> - S3 <br/> - Crackles | - Prolonged expiration <br/> - Barrel chest <br/> - Rhonchi |
| Imaging | - Cardiomegaly <br/> - Pulmonary congestion <br/> - Pleural effusion | - Hyperinflation <br/> - Flattened diaphragm <br/> - Bronchial wall thickening |
| Biomarkers | - Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP | - Normal or mildly elevated BNP |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines emphasize integrating **history, exam, CXR, ECG, and natriuretic peptides** to diagnose heart failure, with wheezes considered a less specific sign that may support congestion but should not be used in isolation [^7056ffdd] [^7417de34]. The universal definition similarly lists wheeze as a less specific sign, reinforcing the need for corroborative evidence [^d855c5a2].

---

## Clinical management considerations

- **Treat congestion**: Use loop diuretics and vasodilators to reduce fluid overload and relieve peribronchial edema, which typically resolves wheezes as congestion improves [^e357c58e].

- **Avoid bronchodilators**: Routine bronchodilators are not indicated for cardiac wheeze unless there is coexisting obstructive disease; they may cause harm in pure heart failure [^89c733bd].

- **Monitor response**: Reassess lung sounds after decongestion; persistence of wheezes should prompt reconsideration of asthma/COPD overlap or alternative diagnoses [^7eeeb390].

---

## Prognostic implications

Faint wheezes in heart failure are not independently prognostic but, when part of a congestive phenotype (with crackles, S3, edema), they correlate with **higher risk of decompensation, longer hospital stay, and need for intensive therapy**. Their resolution with decongestion is a favorable sign of clinical improvement [^notfound].

---

Faint wheezes in the LLB in heart failure reflect **peribronchial edema** causing transient airway narrowing; they are a supportive but nonspecific sign that should be interpreted alongside JVP, edema, CXR, and natriuretic peptides to confirm heart failure and guide therapy [^c31deb26] [^896d3544] [^7056ffdd].

Crepitations are defined as crackling sounds heard usually in lung infection or with pulmonary fibrosis. Pleural friction rub is defined as an abnormal lung sound that is caused by inflammation of the pleural layer of the lungs rubbing together; it is heard on inspiration and expiration and sounds like a low-pitch harsh/ grating noise. Absent breath sounds are defined as absence of breath sounds during auscultation.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^4afb4aa0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Key messages

How can we improve the agreement on lung sound descriptions?
Although auscultation of the lungs is important in medical diagnosis and decision-making, disagreement on the use of terms describing the sounds weakens the diagnostic value of the adventitious lung sounds for chest diseases.
Poor agreement was found when 12 observers classified lung sounds from video recordings of 20 patients with lung diseases into detailed categories, whereas acceptable agreement was obtained when the terms were combined into broader categories.

The stethoscope is the quintessential iconic symbol of the medical profession. However, the reputation of this 200-year-old instrument as a useful diagnostic tool in lung disease has been declining since chest radiography became available.Reports on the limited diagnostic value of chest auscultation in conditions like pneumoniaand heart failurehave contributed to the low standing of chest auscultation among medical experts today. Guidelines from the Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) give little credit to lung sounds, and auscultation findings are not even listed among clues to early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).In the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, however, wheezing is mentioned to be a main symptom of asthma.

Conclusion

Our findings support a cautious attitude when using ALS to diagnose lung disease in elderly patients. The presence of wheezes or crackles in one lung location did not strongly predicted the outcomes analyzed. Nonetheless, it is possible that these solitary findings are a manifestation of lung senescence and/or represent subclinical disease in apparently healthy subjects. However, when inspiratory crackles at two or more locations or both wheezes and crackles are heard, risk of decreased lung function increases considerably. Such findings, particularly when unexpected in a patient, should lead to further investigation regarding possible heart or lung disease.

### Heart failure in dilated cardiomyopathy mimicking asthma triggered by pneumonia [^603c8df5]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a rare cause of wheezing and may develop into a critical condition in children. Few cases report patients with heart failure, secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy, with high fever. A 23-month-old girl visited the emergency department with high fever, cough, first wheezing episode, chest retraction and tachycardia. The chest X-ray revealed consolidation on the left lower lung field; the cardiothoracic ratio was 60%. She was diagnosed with bronchial asthma triggered by pneumonia, which remained unchanged during four visits. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with heart failure in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and discharged without sequelae. During the first wheezing episode in children with abnormal vital signs, heart failure should be considered in the differential diagnosis, and a chest X-ray should be performed. Additionally, when the cardiothoracic ratio is greater than 50%, 12-lead ECG and echocardiography should be performed. Moreover, cognitive bias should be considered in all emergency care unit situations.

Description

An 87-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with progressive dyspnoea on effort over the previous 2 weeks. She had been treated for rheumatoid arthritis with oral prednisolone (5 mg/day) and tacrolimus (2 mg/day). At her first visit, vital signs and physical examination were normal except for slight rhonchi in anterior lung fields. Chest radiograph showed slight cardiomegaly, but no abnormal lesions were noted in either lung (figure 1A). Echocardiography demonstrated no evidence of congestive heart failure. She was thus diagnosed with cough variant asthma and/or asthma, and treated with inhaled budesonide (400 µg/day). However, 10 days later, she returned to our hospital because of increasing dyspnoea. She had tachypnoea (30 breaths/min), and intermittent wheezes emerged in both the cervical (online supplementary audio 1) and left tracheobronchial areas. Additionally, the left bronchovesicular sound (online supplementary audio 2) apparently decreased than that of right tracheobronchial area (online supplementary audio 3).

Figure 1 
Chest radiograph taken at the first visit appeared normal except for slight cardiomegaly (A). Thoracic CT demonstrated that the mediastinal tumour compressed the left main bronchus, which partially invaded the bronchial lumen (B, C).

On the same day, thoracic CT revealed a mediastinal tumour (figure 1B,C) that compressed and/or partially invaded the left tracheal lumen, thereby generating the intermittent wheezes that radiated to the cervical area.

This case reminds us of the critical pitfalls for wheezing resembling asthmaand the power of careful auscultation for appropriate diagnosis.

Learning points

General physicians should always be aware of the possibility of tracheal/bronchial stenosis due to malignant neoplasms whenever they encounter patients who wheeze.
Auscultation can be changeable over a short interval of time, but careful auscultation should be performed for appropriate diagnosis.
The intensity of tracheobronchial sound from bilateral lung fields should be compared in patients with respiratory symptoms.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, more specifically with respect to chest radiography, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary and other diseases likely to cause or contribute to the symptoms in patients with suspected or new-onset HF or presenting with acute decompensated HF.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^7eeeb390]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

### The pulmonary manifestations of left heart failure [^c31deb26]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Determining whether a patient's symptoms are the result of heart or lung disease requires an understanding of the influence of pulmonary venous hypertension on lung function. Herein, we describe the effects of acute and chronic elevations of pulmonary venous pressure on the mechanical and gas-exchanging properties of the lung. The mechanisms responsible for various symptoms of congestive heart failure are described, and the significance of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart disease is considered. While the initial clinical evaluation of patients with dyspnea is imprecise, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide levels may prove useful in this setting.

### Prevalence and clinical associations of wheezes and crackles in the general population: the troms ø study [^e239b331]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Self-reported asthma was associated with wheezes, which was in line with previous studies. Hypertension, self-reported asthma, myocardial infarction, self-reported COPD, and RA were associated with crackles in the univariable analysis, but only the latter two remained statistically significant in the multivariable models. The association of crackles with RA could be explained by the presence of parenchymal lung abnormalities in patients with this diagnosis. However, we did not have an independent confirmation of the diagnosis. Self-reported heart failure was not associated with crackles probably due to underdiagnosed heart failure. Interestingly, symptoms suggestive of airway infection the week before the examination was not an independent predictor of crackles or wheezes. In a European study from primary care of 2810 adults with acute cough, crackles were registered in 31% of patients in the pneumonia group. Since the prevalence of pneumonia in this study was only 5%, and probably far less in our study, it is likely that crackles represented chronic rather than acute changes in the lungs in most cases.

Women had a higher prevalence of wheezes than men. Considering subcategories of wheezes, this observation was valid for expiratory but not for inspiratory wheezes. The same gender disparity has been reported in epidemiological studies on self-reported wheeze. Although wheezing is more common in male newborns and infants, this gender difference seems to change sometime during adolescence when females start to show a higher risk of wheezing. Our findings indicate that this may persist into later adulthood.

Oxygen saturation was significantly associated with the presence of inspiratory crackles. Crackles are related to the sudden opening of closed airways or to air movement through obstructed airways. These conditions may impair ventilation/perfusion matching, the most common cause of hypoxemia, which could explain the relationship in our study.

### Inspiratory crackles-early and late-revisited: identifying COPD by crackle characteristics [^3af4411c]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and the future of the stethoscope

In terms of screening a general adult population for COPD, basal inspiratory crackles can only indicate that a patient might have this disease. However, when they occur early during inspiration, the clinician has reason to suspect COPD, and even more so when heard bilaterally, although such crackles may also indicate bronchiectasisand asthma.The PPVs found in our study are similar to those found for high COPD questionnaire scoresBut, identification of crackles cannot match the questionnaires in terms of sensitivity.

The limited sensitivity we observed, particularly in mild to moderate COPD, reminds us that in most patients with COPD no crackles are heard. However, when listening to the chest wheezes or diminished breath sounds are also useful signs for identifying COPD.The sensitivity of chest auscultation for COPD is, accordingly, considerably higher than for early inspiratory crackles alone. Anyway, a suspicion of COPD will in most cases rely on smoking history and symptoms.

When basal inspiratory crackles are identified in a patient with dyspnoea, the clinicians has to consider heart failureand other restrictive conditionsin addition to the obstructive diseases. In a recent study from Japan, early and fine inspiratory crackles were found in severe interstitial lung disease.When the inspiratory crackles are both early and coarse, a strong attention to the possibility of COPD is timely. In the near future, electronic stethoscopes with automatic machine learning based classification and interpretation of lung sounds might be helpful in this respect.Differentiation between coarse and fine and between early and late crackles can probably be taken into account in future devices and mHealth solutions, being thus more easily integrated in routine clinical practice.

### Cardiac asthma [^826ecb2f]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac dyspnea, especially if present only with exercise, is often confused with asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm. Cardiac dyspnea or asthma is the consequence of pulmonary edema due to pulmonary venous hypertension and not due to asthmatic bronchoconstriction. In overt, acute congestive heart failure, the diagnosis may be readily made by history and physical examination and pertinent laboratory and imaging data.

### Validation of remote cardiopulmonary examination in patients with heart failure with a videophone-based system [^7db57380]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of a videophone-based system for remote cardiopulmonary examination of patients with heart failure.

Methods and Results

Fifty patients were examined by 2 cardiologists, 1 with a conventional stethoscope and 1 remotely with a videophone-based method, employing an electronic stethoscope and transmitting through an integrated services digital network line. During both sessions, the cardiologists filled out a 27-item questionnaire, which was then compared; concordance between standard and remote examination was evaluated. In 92% of patients, electronic and acoustic auscultation concurred. Only in 3 patients (4%) did teleauscultation not permit a correct interpretation of lung examination. In one patient, bilateral fine crepitant rales were not detected during teleauscultation. Conversely, in the second, patient bilateral fine crepitant rales were recognized during teleauscultation, which were not confirmed during real-life auscultation. In the third nonconcordant patient, moderate-degree wheezing was not detected during teleauscultation. Fine crepitant rales were present at the lungs lower fields in 12 and wheezing in 3 additional patients, and were always correctly identified during teleauscultation. Overall, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of remote lung auscultation were 88%, 97%, 94%, and 94%, respectively.

Conclusions

Remote cardiopulmonary examination appears as a feasible method for assessing patients with heart failure. Telestethoscopy can therefore be reliably used in the context of comprehensive telecare programs.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^d855c5a2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF)—common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (>2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into “at risk” and “pre-HF” is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

Respiratory distress—pertinent assessment findings include that severe respiratory distress may manifest with hypoxia, altered mentation, diaphoresis, or inability to speak more than 2–3 words; in the setting of severe bronchoconstriction, wheezing may not be heard and patients with known asthma with severe dyspnea should be empirically treated, even if wheezing is absent; a “shark fin” on waveform capnography suggests significant bronchospasm and obstructive physiology; bronchospastic etiology (e.g., asthma, COPD) is suggested by wheezing on auscultation, “Shark fin” waveform capnograph or prolonged expiratory phase, and history of asthma/COPD; fluid overload etiology (e.g., CHF, pulmonary edema) is suggested by jugular venous distention, rales on auscultation, peripheral edema, and history of CHF, diuretic therapy, dialysis noncompliance, hypertension.

Results

Participants

Tromsø 7 had an attendance of 21,083 (65%) in the first visit. Of these, 9253 had been selected in advance to be invited to the second visit, and 90% (n = 8346) took part. Limited by absences of the staff, we recorded lung sounds in 6035 (72.3%). Restricted by human resources and time constraints, only 4033 participants were included in the classification procedure. Our final number of participants represents 19.1% of the participation in Tromsø 7 and 48.3% of those attending the second visit. A comparison of the main characteristics between all the participants of Tromsø 7 and the final study sample and the flow diagram of the participants included in our analyses are available online.

The mean age of all 4033 participants was 63.5 years, and 2159 (53.5%) were female. (Table 1). There were 477 (11.0%) and 2372 (47%) current and previous smokers, respectively. We found an FEV 1 < LLN in 286 (7.1%) participants and 182 (4.5%) had oxygen saturation ≤ 95% (Table 1). We observed that women had lower proportion of myocardial infarction, heart failure and past smokers, but they presented a higher proportion of self-reported asthma, dyspnea (mMRC) and oxygen saturation ≤ 95%.

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure? [^896d3544]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis.

Objective

To assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

Study Selection

We retained 22 studies of various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality.

Data Synthesis

Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of (1) past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-8.0); (2) the symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.5); (3) the sign of the third heart sound (S(3)) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9-25.0); (4) the chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8-21.0); and (5) electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.8). The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of (1) past history of heart failure (negative LR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38-0.53); (2) the symptom of dyspnea on exertion (negative LR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67); (3) rales (negative LR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37-0.70); (4) the chest radiograph showing cardiomegaly (negative LR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23-0.48); and (5) any electrocardiogram abnormality (negative LR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.88). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum B-type natriuretic peptide <100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07-0.16).

Conclusions

For dyspneic adult emergency department patients, a directed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiography should be performed. If the suspicion of heart failure remains, obtaining a serum BNP level may be helpful, especially for excluding heart failure.

### Identifying possible asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in patients with a new diagnosis of COPD in primary care [^5accb789]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Of the enrolled subjects without chronic airflow obstruction (n =3,175), 23% had lung function impairment, i.e. FEV 1 <80%pred that may suggest underlying respiratory disease other than COPD, but, unfortunately, the present diagnostic algorithm did not allow us to evaluate these individuals further.

The highest prevalence of possible ACOS was observed by applying the definition of chronic airflow obstruction and wheeze. Wheeze is caused by air passing through too narrow airways, and may be caused by different disease processes, including asthma, COPD and heart failure. Thus, this definition may, therefore, seem too broad for identifying individuals with an overlap between asthma and COPD. In keeping with this, patients classified into the ACOS group by this definition had more dyspnoea compared with the COPD-only group. Using the same criteria, although in a cross-sectional population study, Chung et al. found a prevalence of ACOS of 2.3% in the total population, corresponding to a prevalence of 30% in the COPD group, similar to the findings in the present study. Furthermore, Huang et al. have recently reported that the presence of episodic wheezing in patients with COPD has a negative impact on morbidity.

### Prevalence and clinical associations of wheezes and crackles in the general population: the troms ø study [^e30e529a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Two hundred years after its invention, the relevance of the stethoscope in modern medical practice has become a topic of debate. There are some obvious advantages of lung auscultation, such as availability, low cost and non-invasiveness. Lung auscultation remains thus an important part of the respiratory examination, mainly in primary care and in resource-constrained settings.

Lung auscultation has shown to be useful in diagnosing various respiratory disorders. Adventitious lung sounds (ALS) such as wheezes and crackles are associated with common diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, heart failure and pneumonia. Positive findings during auscultation influence clinical decisions such as the rate of antibiotic prescriptions and referrals to specialist care.

Presence of ALS alone, however, only show moderate sensitivities and specificities, limiting their diagnostic utility. This modest accuracy is mainly related to the fact that both wheezes and crackles can also be present in apparently healthy adults [,–]. To determine the real usefulness of ALS it is crucial to define first their behavior, presence and characteristics, in apparently healthy people. Most studies to date, however, have investigated how ALS relate to specific diagnostic categories without considering their distribution across the whole spectrum from health to disease. Moreover, the few existent studies investigating ALS in apparently healthy people used small samples, failing to be representative of the general population. The prevalence of wheezes and crackles in a general population has never been reported.

With this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of wheezes and crackles in a large general adult population. We also explored to which degree ALS are associated with self-reported disease, smoking status and clinical measures of lung function.

### Dyspnoea in a patient with chronic heart failure: surprise, surpise! [^290a1193]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Dyspnoea is one of the typical symptoms of congestive heart failure. The cause of dyspnoea in this patient with chronic heart failure, 8 months after coronary artery bypass grafting, was a great surprise for the heart failure physician, showing that a more broad view of dyspnoea is warranted in this common symptom.

### Unresponsive wheezing to asthma therapy in a 32-year-old female [^58116aa1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Repeat failure of any patient to respond to asthma therapy, particularly corticosteroids, should alert physicians to carry out further pulmonary evaluation. This will prevent unnecessary side effects of asthma therapy and provide prompt treatment for other diseases that may require urgent attention.

Physical Examination Findings

On arrival at the ICU, his temperature was 36.3 °C, heart rate 82 beats/min, blood pressure 109/65 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19 breaths/min, and pulse oxygen saturation 98% on 8 L nasal cannula. The patient was somnolent but awoke easily to voice and followed simple commands. He was oriented to person and place. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. There was no jugular venous distension. The cardiovascular examination was notable for no murmurs, normal rate and rhythm, and normal pulses. Diffuse wheezes and crackles were present bilaterally. He had 1-2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. He had a mild erythematous papular rash on the bilateral lower extremities below the knee.

### Lung ultrasound imaging: a primer for echocardiographers [^5e23eba8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2021). Medium credibility.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) has gained considerable acceptance in emergency and critical care medicine but is yet to be fully implemented in cardiology. Standard imaging protocols for LUS in acute care settings have allowed the rapid and accurate diagnosis of dyspnea, respiratory failure, and shock. LUS is greatly additive to echocardiography and is superior to auscultation and chest radiography, particularly when the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure is in question. In this review, the authors describe LUS techniques, interpretation, and clinical applications, with the goal of informing cardiologists on the imaging modality. Additionally, the authors review LUS findings associated with various disease states most relevant to cardiac care. Although there is extensive literature on LUS in the acute care setting, there is a dearth of reviews directly focused for practicing cardiologists. Current evidence demonstrates that this modality is an important adjunct to echocardiography, providing valuable clinical information at the bedside.

### Management of a severe bilateral pulmonary embolism as a complication of VITT following vaccination with astraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine [^f58594d5]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Exacerbation or deterioration of the ILD. This was excluded based on the CT findings. The CT showed recent bilateral pulmonary emboli, while there was no evidence of the bilateral ground glass opacification and/or consolidation classically seen in ILD.
Bronchial asthma, which was clinically excluded as the pulmonary examination, was completely normal with bilateral equal air entry and absence of wheezes.
COVID-19 viral pneumonia was excluded as the patient had a negative PCR of COVID-19 and the CT findings did not show the picture of viral pneumonia.
Bacterial pneumonia: pneumonic pulmonary infiltrations were identified in the CT examination together with the pulmonary embolism. According to the radiological report, these pneumonic infiltrations are most probably a post-infarction superadded infection. A history of aspiration pneumonia was unlikely, since the patient denied any history of aspiration.
Idiopathic pulmonary embolism.
Decompensated heart failure was excluded by echocardiography, which showed normal cardiac dimensions and function.

### Uncovering heart failure in patients with a history of pulmonary disease: rationale for the early use of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency department [^04d3deb4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can reliably identify acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea. Heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are syndromes where dyspnea and wheezing are overlapping signs, and hence, these syndromes are often difficult to differentiate.

Objective

To determine whether BNP can distinguish new-onset heart failure in patients with COPD or asthma presenting with dyspnea to the ED.

Methods

The BNP Multinational Study was a seven-center prospective study of 1,586 adult patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea who had blinded BNP levels measured on arrival with a rapid, point-of-care device. This study evaluated the 417 patients with no previous history of heart failure and a history of asthma or COPD as a subgroup from the 1,586 adult patients in the BNP Multinational Study. The reference standard for CHF was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP results, who reviewed all clinical data and standardized CHF scores.

Results

A total of 417 subjects (mean age 62.2 years, 64.4% male) had a history of asthma or COPD without a history of CHF. Of these, 87/417 (20.9%, 95% CI = 17.1% to 25.1%) were found to have CHF as the final adjudicated diagnosis. The emergency physicians identified a minority, 32/87 (36.8%), of these patients with CHF. The mean BNP values (+/- SD) were 587.0 +/- 426.4 and 108.8 +/- 221.3 pg/mL for those with and without CHF (p < 0.0001). At a cutpoint of 100 pg/mL, BNP had the following decision statistics: sensitivity 93.1%, specificity 77.3%, positive predictive value 51.9%, negative predictive value 97.7%, accuracy 80.6%, positive likelihood ratio 4.10, and negative likelihood ratio 0.09. If BNP would have been added to clinical judgment (high > or = 80% probability of CHF), at a cutpoint of 100 pg/mL, 83/87 (95.4%) of the CHF subjects would have been correctly diagnosed. Multivariate analysis found BNP to be the most important predictor of CHF (OR = 12.1, 95% CI = 5.4 to 27.0, p < 0.0001). In the 87 subjects found to have CHF, 39.0%, 22.2%, and 54.8% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers (BBs), and diuretics on a chronic basis, respectively.

Conclusions

The yield of adding routine BNP testing in patients with a history of asthma or COPD in picking up newly diagnosed CHF is approximately 20%. This group of patients presents a substantial therapeutic opportunity for the initiation and chronic administration of ACEI and BB therapy, as well as other CHF management strategies.

### The highs and lows of wheezing: a review of the most popular adventitious lung sound [^636e0d6f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

Wheezing is the most widely reported adventitious lung sound in the English language. It is recognized by health professionals as well as by lay people, although often with a different meaning. Wheezing is an indicator of airway obstruction and therefore of interest particularly for the assessment of young children and in other situations where objective documentation of lung function is not generally available. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms producing wheeze, its subjective perception and description, its objective measurement, and visualization, and its relevance in clinical practice.

### Acute respiratory failure in the elderly: etiology, emergency diagnosis and prognosis [^0113b454]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

In Western countries the population is getting older, and it is projected that the number of people between the age of 65 and 80 years will double by the year 2030. It is estimated that more than 10% of the population over the age of 80 years have heart failure. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is one of the major causes of consultation of elderly patients in emergency departments (EDs) and is the key symptom of most cardiac and respiratory diseases, such as cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE), and of exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease (CRD) including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are associated with a high morbidity and mortality [-]. In elderly patients, differentiating CPE from respiratory causes is difficult for several reasons. Cardiac and respiratory diseases frequently coexist. Atypical clinical presentation, such as wheezing in CPE (cardiac asthma) or lack of infectious signs in pneumonia, is confusing. In the oldest patients, autopsy studies have demonstrated that the main causes of death were CPE, CAP, and PE, which are frequently underestimated. There is little knowledge of the presentation, clinical characteristics and outcomes of ARF in elderly patients. Furthermore, two studies suggested that prognosis was improved when early diagnostic and treatments were accurate.

The objectives of this study were therefore to determine the causes of ARF in elderly patients, the accuracy of the initial diagnosis suspected by the emergency physician, the impact of initial diagnosis and treatment, and variables associated with in-hospital death.

### Evaluating the utility of chest X-rays for non-traumatic chest pain in Australia-a retrospective cohort study [^4b5a909e]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting

The study was conducted in an adult major referral hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria, with an annual emergency department (ED) attendance of approximately 65,000 patients. The hospital provides state services for major trauma, burns, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, heart and lung transplants, HIV, and adult hematological malignancies.

Design: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using explicit chart review.

Inclusion criteria

We included all adult patients who were investigated with a CXR in the ED between 01 Jan 2022 and 31 Dec 2022.

Exclusion criteria

The exclusion criteria consisted of patients who were under 18 years old, patients with more than one CXR during their presentation, patients without chest pain, patients with a traumatic etiology of chest pain, and patients without any medical history documented.

Data extraction

Data were extracted from the electronic medical record system using explicit chart review by a single investigator (AL). Data on demographics, presenting vital signs, hemoptysis, chest auscultation findings (diminished lung sounds, rales, wheezes), and history of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), chronic lung diseases (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, history of lung transplant), heart failure, and smoking were extracted.

Past medical history and chest auscultation findings were categorized into present or absent. Smoking history was categorized as non-smoker, ex-smoker, or current smoker. Vital signs were categorized into abnormal or normal, based on the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital patient observation vital signs policy. A respiratory rate of 12–20 breaths per minute, heart rate of 60–100 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure of 90–129 mmHg, temperature of 36.5-37.2 o C, and oxygen saturations of 97–100% were considered normal.

Radiology reports were extracted and CXRs were subgrouped into those with abnormalities reported and compared to those without. CXRs with abnormalities were subgrouped into those that were clinically significant and compared to those that were not. Overt signs of heart failure, consolidation, masses, and fractures that were likely to change management were considered to be clinically significant. Where signs of heart failure or infection were reported to be subtle, medical records were further reviewed to extract data on whether the abnormality had changed the clinical management of the patients. Specifically, the initiation of acute heart failure therapy or antibiotic therapy in the ED was considered to be clinically significant.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 62-year-old woman was transferred to the ICU from the medical ward with acute bronchospastic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Four weeks before, the patient was vacationing in Arizona and acquired a mildly productive cough as well as mild dyspnea. She presented to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. She received a 5-day course of azithromycin, with partial improvement of her symptoms. The patient returned home 1 week prior to admission, reporting worsening dyspnea, chest pressure, cough, and fever. The patient was admitted to the medical ward, and treatment for unresolved pneumonia was begun with levofloxacin, an inhaled short-acting beta agonist, and oral prednisone. Despite this treatment, the patient experienced severe respiratory distress with audible wheezing as well as increased work of breathing. She was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and transferred to the ICU.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^89e6e595]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the ‘time to appropriate therapy’ — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes,. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides,. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients,. Furthermore, patients’ clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed,.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%),. Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated,,. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist,,. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

### Evaluating the utility of chest X-rays for non-traumatic chest pain in Australia-a retrospective cohort study [^a3130c4d]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings of hemoptysis in the context of NTCP can be associated with pneumonia, lung abscess, cancer, or pulmonary embolism. Auscultation findings of diminished lung sounds can stem from either weak sound generation or impaired transmission from obstruction. Possible causes are obstructive respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or shallow breathing upon examination. Our definition of rales included coarse and fine crackles or crepitations, with fine crackles being heard in conditions like early congestive heart failure and interstitial lung disease. Coarse crackles are heard in conditions like asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. However, even though the auscultation findings were found to be associated with clinically significant abnormal CXRs, they are highly variable as clinical features to utilize. Auscultation is subject to differing clinical expertise, external noise level, and patient factors like body habitus, or effort of breathing during the examination. Oxygen saturations are in comparison more reliable as a clinical marker for disease.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^414715d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will check the limitations of the existing auscultation method by checking the types of abnormal breathing sounds and the accuracy of analysis through the existing stethoscope. Next, we will introduce the new auscultation methods developed so far (AI-assisted analysis and wireless or attached stethoscopes) and the current status of breath sound analysis using them. Furthermore, we will suggest further research directions in the future.

Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds

Respiratory sounds are produced by the airflow in the respiratory tract and are divided into two categories: Normal or abnormal sound. Normal respiratory sound is made when there is no pulmonary disorder and consist of tracheal, bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular sounds. Abnormal respiratory sounds are caused by diseases at the lung or bronchus. They can be described by the mechanism of production, location they are detected in, characteristics (such as continuity, range of pitch, timing mostly heard), and acoustic features (Table 1).

Table 1 
Classification of abnormal lung sounds and related diseases

Crackles are short, discontinuous, explosive sounds heard during inspiration and sometimes on expiration. Fine crackles are generated by inspiratory opening of small airways and associated with interstitial pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Coarse crackles are produced by gas passing through intermittent airway opening and are related to secretory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Wheezes are generated in the narrowed or obstructed airway. They have high frequency (> 100–5000 Hz) and sinusoidal oscillation in sound analysis. They usually occur in obstructive airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhonchi are induced by the narrowing of airways, caused by the production of secretions, so rhonchi can disappear after coughing (Table 1).

Stridor is a high-pitched, continuous sound produced by turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway of upper respiratory tract. It is usually a sign of airway obstruction that requires prompt intervention. In patients with pleural inflammation such as pleurisy or pleural tumor, a visceral pleura becomes rough, and its friction with the parietal pleura generates crackling sounds, a friction rub (Table 1).

Although respiratory sounds are not difficult for a trained clinician to discern in usual cases, some sounds are ambiguous even for an expert to distinguish accurately. In addition, there are some cases where a mixture of several abnormal breathing sounds can be heard. Novel AI-assisted stethoscope can be useful for these challenging situations.

### Age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) in asymptomatic cardiovascular patients [^f3586a34]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The presence of age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) might interfere with a physician's clinical management of patients with suspected heart failure. We examined the characteristics of pulmonary crackles among patients with stage A cardiovascular disease (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure staging criteria), stratiffed by decade, because little is known about these issues in such patients at high risk for congestive heart failure who have no structural heart disease or acute heart failure symptoms.

Methods

After exclusion of comorbid pulmonary and other critical diseases, 274 participants, in whom the heart was structurally (based on Doppler echocardiography) and functionally (B-type natriuretic peptide <80 pg/mL) normal and the lung (X-ray evaluation) was normal, were eligible for the analysis.

Results

There was a significant difference in the prevalence of crackles among patients in the low (45-64 years; n = 97; 11%; 95% CI, 5%-18%), medium (65-79 years; n = 121; 34%; 95% CI, 27%-40%), and high (80-95 years; n = 56; 70%; 95% CI, 58%-82%) age-groups (P <.001). The risk for audible crackles increased approximately threefold every 10 years after 45 years of age. During a mean follow-up of 11 +/- 2.3 months (n = 255), the short-term (< or =3 months) reproducibility of crackles was 87%. The occurrence of cardiopulmonary disease during follow-up included cardiovascular disease in 5 patients and pulmonary disease in 6.

Conclusions

Recognition of age-related pulmonary crackles (rales) is important because such clinically unimportant crackles are so common among elderly patients that, without knowledge of this phenomenon, their existence might interfere with the physician's management of cardiopulmonary patients.

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^79e10d3e]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and  measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation  tests to detect underlying AHR.

### International perception of lung sounds: a comparison of classification across some European borders [^1cdec914]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung auscultation is helpful in the diagnosis of lung and heart diseases; however, the diagnostic value of lung sounds may be questioned due to interobserver variation. This situation may also impair clinical research in this area to generate evidence-based knowledge about the role that chest auscultation has in a modern clinical setting. The recording and visual display of lung sounds is a method that is both repeatable and feasible to use in large samples, and the aim of this study was to evaluate interobserver agreement using this method.

Methods

With a microphone in a stethoscope tube, we collected digital recordings of lung sounds from six sites on the chest surface in 20 subjects aged 40 years or older with and without lung and heart diseases. A total of 120 recordings and their spectrograms were independently classified by 28 observers from seven different countries. We employed absolute agreement and kappa coefficients to explore interobserver agreement in classifying crackles and wheezes within and between subgroups of four observers.

Results

When evaluating agreement on crackles (inspiratory or expiratory) in each subgroup, observers agreed on between 65% and 87% of the cases. Conger’s kappa ranged from 0.20 to 0.58 and four out of seven groups reached a kappa of ≥0.49. In the classification of wheezes, we observed a probability of agreement between 69% and 99.6% and kappa values from 0.09 to 0.97. Four out of seven groups reached a kappa ≥0.62.

Conclusions

The kappa values we observed in our study ranged widely but, when addressing its limitations, we find the method of recording and presenting lung sounds with spectrograms sufficient for both clinic and research.

### "Velcro-type" crackles predict specific radiologic features of fibrotic interstitial lung disease [^34b0f9d6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Emphysema did not correlate with the presence of crackles, in keeping with the concept that destruction of alveolar walls result in a weaker transmission of lung sounds, either normal or adventitious. In patients with coexisting fibrosis and emphysema it is possible that emphysema could mask “Velcro-type” crackles, thus decreasing the sensitivity of an acoustic assessment for fibrosis. To investigate this possibility, within this study we compared the emphysema scores between subgroups of FILD patients with different acoustic findings, and identified no evidence that emphysema reduces the sensitivity of auscultation to identify lung fibrosis.

This study has some points of strength. We recruited a large population of patients with a broad spectrum of lung pathologies. Lung sounds were recorded using a simple, point-of-care tool: an electronic stethoscope which is easily applicable in every clinical setting. The assessment of the recordings was performed by physicians blinded to any clinical information and unbiased towards their source (same or different patients). Lung sounds were paired with single HRCT slices: this approach allowed a precise matching with radiologic abnormalities in the lung parenchyma below the site of auscultation. Whilst lung sounds generated from a specific area might spread towards different regions of the same lung or to the other side of the chest, the transmission of “Velcro-type” crackles over different areas has been shown to be more limited than in other conditions such as chronic heart failure or pneumonia, supporting the rationale for the approach followed in this study. The limitations of this study are mainly related to the research setting and cross-sectional design, which did not allow a comprehensive characterisation of the study population. The participants were not followed up and the final clinical diagnosis remained unknown in most cases. Physiology measurements and other clinical data were not collected, thereafter the relationships between “Velcro-type” crackles and clinical or functional deterioration were not addressed. Nevertheless, the study primarily focused on the validity of the subjective assessment of “Velcro-type” crackles against HRCT imaging, irrespectively of the clinical diagnosis or the functional status of the patients.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1f7ad5f6]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Wheezing and chest tightness—In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes and chest tightness may vary between days and over a single day, and widespread inspiratory or expiratory wheezes can be present on auscultation. Chest tightness often follows exertion, is poorly localized, is muscular in character, and may arise from isometric contraction of the intercostal muscles. An absence of wheezing or chest tightness does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD, nor does the presence of these symptoms confirm a diagnosis of asthma.

### A simple new visualization of exercise data discloses pathophysiology and severity of heart failure [^ce5348aa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Limitations

(1)–versus–alone do not give us exact measures of cardiac output, stroke volume, C(a−v)O 2, or C(v−a)CO 2. Despite that, the absolute values and changing patterns of–versus–on a single X–Y plot give us new and important insights into normal physiology and the pathophysiology and severity of heart failure. (2) Other causes are likely present, but the hypothesis that low cardiac output is more important than highin explaining the gas exchange findings in heart failure warrants confirmation or refutation by others. (3) Because this is a preliminary study, larger numbers of healthy subjects, athletes, or patients with other heart diseases and disorders are not reported. (4) Finally, patients with anemia, primary lung diseases, or right-sided heart failure are not reported. In patients with heart failure and anemia, we would anticipate that despite reduced blood viscosity, a low exercise cardiac output would dominate. Thus, one would expect the highestandto be lower than without anemia, but we have no evidence to confirm or refute that. In patients with primary lung disease without evident primary heart disease, we have noted that some patients with severe airways obstruction may have only mild or no reductions in their highestorsecondary to their ventilatory limitation—ie, their inability to increase ventilation normally. However, their pattern of–versus–is abnormal in that they stop incremental exercise when they reach their highest values ofor, which is dissimilar to patients with exclusive left heart failure.

### Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^6ef8f713]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is shortness of breath that lasts more than one month. The perception of dyspnea varies based on behavioral and physiologic responses. Dyspnea that is greater than expected with the degree of exertion is a symptom of disease. Most cases of dyspnea result from asthma, heart failure and myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, or psychogenic disorders. The etiology of dyspnea is multifactorial in about one-third of patients. The clinical presentation alone is adequate to make a diagnosis in 66 percent of patients with dyspnea. Patients' descriptions of the sensation of dyspnea may be helpful, but associated symptoms and risk factors, such as smoking, chemical exposures, and medication use, should also be considered. Examination findings (e.g., jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds or wheezing, pleural rub, clubbing) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Initial testing in patients with chronic dyspnea includes chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide levels may help exclude heart failure, and D-dimer testing may help rule out pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies can be used to identify emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Computed tomography of the chest is the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosing suspected pulmonary causes of chronic dyspnea. To diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension or certain interstitial lung diseases, right heart catheterization or bronchoscopy may be needed.

### Lung ultrasound for the emergency diagnosis of pneumonia, acute heart failure, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease / asthma in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a257161a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung ultrasound can accelerate the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases in adults with respiratory symptoms.

Objective

Systematically review the accuracy of lung ultrasonography (LUS) for emergency diagnosis of pneumonia, acute heart failure, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma in adults.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS (Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde; until 2016) were searched for prospective diagnostic accuracy studies. Rutter-Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic method was used to measure the overall accuracy of LUS and Reitsma bivariate model to measure the accuracy of the different sonographic signs. This review was previously registered in PROSPERO (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK; CRD42016048085).

Results

Twenty-five studies were included: 14 assessing pneumonia, 14 assessing acute heart failure, and four assessing exacerbations of COPD/asthma. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of LUS was 0.948 for pneumonia, 0.914 for acute heart failure, and 0.906 for exacerbations of COPD/asthma. In patients suspected to have pneumonia, consolidation had sensitivity of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.88) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) for this disease. In acutely dyspneic patients, modified diffuse interstitial syndrome had sensitivity of 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93) and specificity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.95) for acute heart failure, whereas B-profile had sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.72-0.98) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.79-0.97) for this disease in patients with respiratory failure. In patients with acute dyspnea or respiratory failure, the A-profile without PLAPS (posterior-lateral alveolar pleural syndrome) had sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.67-0.86) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.97) for exacerbations of COPD/asthma.

Conclusion

Lung ultrasound is an accurate tool for the emergency diagnosis of pneumonia, acute heart failure, and exacerbations of COPD/asthma.

Methods

Participants and cohort description

A detailed breakdown of participants stratified by geographic site and diagnostic label is provided in Table 3. A total of 572 patients were recruited in the context of a multi-site observational cohort study using a standardised acquisition protocol. Selection criteria aimed to recruit patients below the age of 16 presenting at paediatric outpatient facilities who had suspected lower respiratory tract infection, acute asthma or obstructive bronchitis. Patients with known chronic underlying respiratory disease (e.g. fibrosis) or heart failure were excluded. In total, 71% (n = 407/572) were clinically diagnosed cases with one of three diagnostic labels: (i) pneumonia, (ii) wheezing disorders, or (iii) bronchiolitis. The remaining 29% (n = 165/572) were age- and sex-balanced controls with no respiratory symptoms, consulting at the same emergency unit for other complaints. Distributions of age and respiratory rates between cases and controls are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.

b In POA, 53 cases had no differentiation between bronchiolitis and wheezing disorder and are not listed in a specific column.

All participants were recruited between 2016 and 2020 at the outpatient departments of six hospitals across five countries (120 in Geneva, Switzerland; 283 in Porto Alegre, Brazil; 31 in Dakar, Senegal; 79 in Yaoundé, Cameroon; and finally 59 from Rabat and Marrakesh in Morocco). Detailed summary statistics are provided in Supplementary Table 2. All diagnoses are validated by two medical doctors. Pneumonia is diagnosed radiologically where possible or by the presence of audible crackles and/or febrile respiratory distress. 90% of the pneumonia cases were reported as bacterial, and the rest as viral. These are grouped into a single category of pneumonia due to the notorious difficulty of distinguishing between them objectively. Bronchiolitis and wheezing disorders (comprising asthma and obstructive bronchitis) are diagnosed clinically.

Definition of WHF

Hospitalizations for WHF, including in patients with preexisting and new-onset HF, were identified using EHR data and defined as including 1 symptom or more (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, and/or tachypnea), 2 objective findings or more (tachycardia [heart rate >100 beats/min], elevated BNP [≥100 pg/mL; to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1], and/or chest radiographic findings [pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and/or cardiomegaly]) including 1 sign or more (lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales or wheezing, jugular venous distension, third heart sound [S 3 gallop], hepatomegaly, and/or abdominal swelling), and new administration of intravenous (IV) loop diuretics (≥2 doses) and/or new hemodialysis or continuous kidney replacement therapy (eTable 1 in the Supplement). These diagnostic criteria are based on a standardized definition of inpatient and outpatient WHF previously developed and validated by a consensus panel of trialists with expertise in clinical end point classification in collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration. This multidimensional definition is specific for WHF and was accurate and reproducible in multiple pivotal trials of investigational drugs and devices for which regulatory approval was being sought.,,

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) clinical presentation—Symptoms are non-specific and mainly related to progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, with initial symptoms typically triggered by exertion and including shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina and syncope; less commonly patients describe dry cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting, while symptoms at rest occur only in advanced cases and abdominal distension and ankle oedema mainly develop with progressing RV failure. Physical signs include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an RV third heart sound, a pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and a diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation; in advanced disease elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral oedema and cool extremities are seen, and wheeze and crackles are usually absent. Clinical examination may suggest an underlying cause of PH, with telangiectasia, digital ulceration and sclerodactyly seen in scleroderma, inspiratory crackles pointing towards interstitial lung disease, spider naevi, testicular atrophy and palmar erythema suggesting liver disease, and when digital clubbing is encountered PVOD, cyanotic CHD, interstitial lung disease or liver disease should be considered.

One hour after the onset of symptoms, he developed dyspnea and wheezing. Widespread moist rales and wheezes occurred in both lung fields. His respiratory rate was 35–40 breaths/min, his heart rate was 160–170 beats/min, and his blood pressure was 107/76 mm Hg. Arterial blood gas analysis results were as follows: pH, 7.08; PO 2, 70 mm Hg; PCO 2, 40 mm Hg; Lac, 4.7 mmol/L; and SaO 2, 52%. Emergent tracheal intubation was immediately performed, and a ventilator was used to assist breathing. Meanwhile, the patient also received diuretic treatment due to pulmonary edema. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (heart rate was 170 beats/min); blood pressure was 124/63 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate was 40 breaths/min. Emergency bedside color ultrasound showed a diffuse B line in both lungs, and the size of the cardiac cavity was normal, but the ventricular rate was extremely fast. Emergency bedside chest radiography suggested pulmonary edema with a normal cardiac silhouette (Fig. 2). Repeated arterial blood gas analysis results were as follows: pH, 7.05; PO 2, 92 mm Hg; PCO 2, 59 mm Hg; and Lac, 4.7 mmol/L (FIO 2 100%).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1663422b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Lung function testing is essential—use lung function testing to confirm the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation and variable expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is preferably performed at the initial assessment; in cases of clinical urgency it may be delayed to a subsequent visit, but confirmation of diagnosis may be more difficult once patients are started on ICS-containing therapy. Early confirmation (or exclusion) of the presence of persistent expiratory airflow limitation may avoid needless trials of therapy or delays in initiating other investigations. Measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) on the same meter over a period of 1–2 weeks may help to confirm reversible airflow limitation and the diagnosis of asthma by demonstrating excessive variability; however, PEF is not as reliable as spirometry, and a normal PEF does not rule out either asthma or COPD. Consider alternative diagnoses; the above approach to diagnosis does not replace the need for a full assessment to first exclude non-respiratory diagnoses such as heart failure, and physical examination may provide supportive information.

### Paediatric asthma-all that wheezes is not necessarily asthma-current diagnostic and management strategies [^ab0f2f8b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a frequently encountered chronic medical condition encountered in paediatrics, affecting 7% of children under the age of 18 in the United States. Although asthma is one of the more common conditions that is associated with wheezing, there is a broad differential diagnosis to consider. The purpose of this review is to describe other causes of wheezing outside of asthma in a paediatric population and discuss diagnostic and management strategies to consider when evaluating a child or adolescent with wheezing.

Recent Findings

The characteristics of the wheezing along with other associated signs and symptoms can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The age and the past medical history of the patient are also important aspects to consider when determining next steps in the evaluation and management of paediatric wheezing. In addition to considering other causes of wheezing, it is often necessary to assess for the presence of underlying asthma, and recently updated asthma guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provide a graded review of various recommendations for making the diagnosis and managing asthma in the clinical setting.

Summary

It is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating a paediatric patient with wheezing.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of asthma mimics [^b1aee67a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common diagnosis or preexisting condition, and many patients with acute asthma exacerbation may present to the emergency department with wheezing and respiratory distress. However, many conditions may mimic this presentation.

Objectives

This review provides an overview of common asthma mimics and an approach to evaluation and management.

Discussion

Asthma is characterized by an obstructive pulmonary disease with recurrent exacerbations. The disease may present with a variety of symptoms, including wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and even respiratory failure. Mimics include anaphylaxis, angioedema, central airway obstruction, heart failure, allergic reaction, foreign body aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and vocal cord dysfunction. The approach to evaluation and management of these patients includes assessment for life-threatening conditions while treatment and resuscitation is underway. Providers should assess for red flags, including no history of asthma, lack of severe asthma, and no improvement with standard treatments. Focused assessment with history, physical examination, chest imaging, electrocardiogram, and laboratory studies may provide benefit. Through consideration of these mimics and treatment, providers can provide rapid management.

Conclusions

While asthma is a common disease, many asthma mimics exist. Through consideration of other diseases with wheezing and assessing for red flags, such as patients presenting without a history of asthma or patients with a history of only mild asthma presenting with severe symptoms, emergency providers may decrease the chance of early diagnostic closure and anchoring while improving the care of these patients.

Is it the lack of a clear diagnosis and uncertainty about the boy’s long-term prognosis that is causing the worry? Do the parents want advice on avoiding triggers or information on what to do when the wheezing recurs, or is the main focus of this consultation the (perceived) additional value of a referral to a specialist?

Acute dyspnea—B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone precursor (NTproBNP) may help evaluate heart failure as the cause of dyspnea and can expedite evaluation and treatment; however, routine use of BNP in all patients with acute dyspnea is not recommended. In acute care settings such as an ED, sensitivity of BNP or NTproBNP is substantially higher than specificity and utility is greatest for ruling out heart failure when pretest probability is low to intermediate, while the utility of serial BNP testing in known heart failure is uncertain.

### Congestive heart failure: diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^e357c58e]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest-radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis. Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

### Every second counts: signs of a failing heart on thoracic CT in the ED [^0ae890b4]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Impending cardiac failure is often difficult to recognize and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Upon arrival in the emergency department, patients are promptly screened for potentially life-threatening conditions through a history and physical examination. In many cases, the diagnosis is not clear until confirmatory laboratory or imaging tests are performed. Unfortunately, patients can rapidly decompensate as this diagnostic information is being obtained. Emergent CT plays a key role in identifying conditions that may result in cardiovascular collapse, including severe congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, and impending cardiac failure. Characteristic imaging findings can prompt the physician to take immediate action and prepare for resuscitation.

### "Velcro-type" crackles predict specific radiologic features of fibrotic interstitial lung disease [^a9a65c8c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (FILD) represents a diverse and challenging group of disorders with varied treatment strategies and prognoses. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most frequent and deadly among FILD. Recognition of signs and symptoms suggestive of FILD by healthcare practitioners represents a valuable point-of-care, low-cost opportunity for detection of early disease and timely diagnostic work up. Chest auscultation remains an important clinical assessment in patients with respiratory disorders, providing immediate and reliable information to clinicians. “Velcro-type” crackles are brief, discontinuous pathological lung sounds, explosive and transient in character, named after their similarity to the sound generated by Velcro strips separating. Historically, “Velcro-type” crackles have been considered representative of established lung fibrosis, and quantitative analysis of crackles in ILD confirmed distinctive features as compared to those generated in other disorders such as chronic heart failure and pneumonia. While international consensus guidelines recommend that IPF is suspected in all patients with bibasilar inspiratory “Velcro-type” crackles, the direct association between “Velcro-type” crackles and specific radiologic features of pulmonary fibrosis has not been thoroughly clarified.

In this prospective case-control study, we systematically investigate the relationships between audible digitally recorded “Velcro-type” crackles and HRCT features and patterns of FILD with the aim of providing substantial evidence as to the potential role of lung sounds as a screening and monitoring tool in ILD. Lung sounds were digitally recorded from subjects immediately prior to undergoing clinically indicated HRCT. Audio files were independently assessed by two chest physicians and both full volume and single HRCT sections corresponding to the recording sites were extracted. The relationship between audible “Velcro-type” crackles and radiologic HRCT patterns or individual features of pulmonary fibrosis was investigated using multivariate regression models.

### Mechanism of inspiratory and expiratory crackles [^3e1ca400]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Although crackles are frequently heard on auscultation of the chest of patients with common cardiopulmonary disorders, the mechanism of production of these sounds is inadequately understood. The goal of this research was to gain insights into the mechanism of crackle generation by systematic examination of the relationship between inspiratory and expiratory crackle characteristics.

Methods

Patients with a significant number of both inspiratory and expiratory crackles were examined using a multichannel lung sound analyzer. These patients included 37 with pneumonia, 5 with heart failure, and 13 with interstitial fibrosis. Multiple crackle characteristics were calculated for each crackle, including frequency, amplitude, crackle transmission coefficient, and crackle polarity.

Results

Spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics of expiratory and inspiratory crackles in these patients were found to be similar, but two characteristics were strikingly different: crackle numbers and crackle polarities. Inspiratory crackles were almost twice as numerous as expiratory crackles (n = 3,308 vs 1,841) and had predominately negative polarity (76% of inspiratory crackles vs 31% of expiratory crackles).

Conclusion

These observations are quantitatively consistent with the so-called stress-relaxation quadrupole hypothesis of crackle generation. This hypothesis holds that expiratory crackles are caused by sudden airway closure events that are similar in mechanism but opposite in sign and far less energetic than the explosive opening events that generate inspiratory crackles. We conclude that the most likely mechanism of crackle generation is sudden airway closing during expiration and sudden airway reopening during inspiration.

### An unusual case of chronic hemoptysis [^f7d10715]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 62-year-old African American man was admitted to the hospital with hemoptysis. He had a complicated medical history significant for active tobacco use (>50 pack-year history), coronary artery disease, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. He reported intermittent episodes of coughing up streaks of blood in the sputum for the past 3 years. For the past few days before this presentation, he had multiple episodes of coughing up over a tablespoon of only blood. He was not on any anticoagulant agents. There were no risk factors for TB, nor was there a history of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, leg swelling, changes in his urine color and frequency or urgency, or unintended weight loss. On admission, he was noted to be breathing comfortably. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 36.6ºC, BP of 138/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 66 beats/min, respiratory of rate of 18 breaths/min, and a blood oxygen saturation level of 98% on room air. Physical examination was significant for decreased bilateral breath sounds with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal cardiac rhythm without murmur, rubs, or gallops. There was no clubbing or edema on his extremities.

### Inspiratory crackles-early and late-revisited: identifying COPD by crackle characteristics [^14b28ec7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Crackles are respiratory sounds often heard in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as in restrictive conditions, such as heart failure, lung fibrosis and pneumonia.Forgacs proposed that crackles heard during inspiration were related to sudden opening of airways.Since the inflation of the lungs happens sequentially, and the basal parts inflate later during inspiration than the central parts,crackles may be described by time of appearance. Few years after Forgacs published his findings, Nath and Capel observed clear differences in the timing of crackles between patients with bronchial obstruction, in whom early crackles usually were heard, and patients with restrictive lung defects, who had late crackles.This difference could be explained by the site of airway closure, that is, central airways in obstructive and peripheral airways in restrictive defects.

Although Nath and Capel proposed that the timing of crackles could be clinically helpful, which was also supported by Piirilä et al,recent guidelines for diagnosing COPDand heart failuredo not mention the distinction between early and late crackles. Instead, another subdivision based on crackle characteristics is frequently referred to, namely ‘coarse’ versus ‘fine’. These crackle types are defined by the duration of each single crackle.Coarse crackles may be caused by sudden opening of obstructed central bronchii, while fine crackles are related to opening of distal airways.Coarse and early crackles are related to each other, since coarse crackles tend to appear early during inspirationand both coarse and early crackles are commonly heard in obstructive lung diseases.The clinical usefulness of differentiating coarse from fine crackles has however been questioned due to low agreement between clinicians in identifying these crackle characteristics.Yet these conclusions have been mainly based on small datasets, and we hypothesise that the distinction between ‘early’ and ‘late’ will generate higher agreement and possibly also be more useful in clinical practice.

In the seventh Tromsø study (2015–2016), lung sound recordings from six chest locations were classified in more than 4000 participants,and the presence of COPD could be evaluated in most of these. The possible role of crackle characteristics (early/late and coarse/fine) when identifying obstructive lung conditions could now be re-evaluated in a non-selected general population.

The aim of this study was therefore to assess the diagnostic value of early vs late, and coarse vs fine inspiratory crackles heard at the lung bases, for the identification of COPD. Further, we wanted to evaluate the agreement between clinicians in identifying these crackle characteristics.

Airway and parenchymal respiratory morbidity in pediatric heart failure—Chest X-ray imaging should be obtained in the pediatric HF patient who presents with new or worsening respiratory symptoms to evaluate for treatable pulmonary complications (Level of Evidence C). Flexible bronchoscopy is a safe and effective first-line approach to diagnosing bronchial compression due to cardiomegaly as a cause for recurrent pneumonia or persistent atelectasis in the child with HF (Level of Evidence C). Polysomnography should be performed in patients with signs and symptoms of sleep-related breathing disorders, especially when pulmonary hypertension is present (Level of Evidence C). Pulmonary function testing should be used for detection and reversibility of obstructive-related breathing disorders, especially when pulmonary hypertension is present, and should be used for detection and reversibility of obstructive defects as well as for the diagnosis of restrictive lung disease (both Level of Evidence C). Exercise testing with metabolic studies should be used to determine a component of respiratory limitation to exercise in symptoms with HF (Level of Evidence C). During acute intercurrent pulmonary illness, the abrupt discontinuation of β-blockers and ACE inhibitors is not indicated unless there is a life-threatening complication related to their use, and classical asthma medications are generally not effective in the treatment of cardiac asthma (both Level of Evidence B).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions include, but are not limited to urticaria; itching; edema of extremities; respiratory wheezing or asthma; dyspnea; cyanosis; tachycardia; lacrimation; marked perspiration; flushing of face, neck or upper chest; mild persistent clearing of throat; hacking cough or persistent sneezing.

1)	Local Reactions

A mild burning immediately after injection is expected; this usually subsides in 10-20 seconds. Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection, making this injection route undesirable. Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route.

Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common. Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter.

Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable, but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased. In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing.

Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient’s allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or use of oral antihistamines.

2)	Systemic Reactions

Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient’s allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions.14Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response. It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is always a possibility. Fatalities are rare but can occur.5Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis,and urticaria.13, 14

Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions. Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions. Refer to “OVERDOSAGE” section.

Association Bulletin #15-02—other differential diagnoses that can mimic TACO include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to transfusion, for which other etiologies should be considered when evaluating TRALI or TACO. Another main consideration is an allergic reaction with a pulmonary component; hypersensitivity features such as urticarial rash may be helpful, expiratory wheezing is suggestive of an allergic reaction, and in TACO inspiratory crackles are typically heard; response to antihistamines can support an allergic reaction, though diuretics and antihistamines may be given simultaneously. Additional mimics include air embolism, other non-transfusion causes such as acute asthma, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax, and cardiac syndromes that may present as “flash” pulmonary edema, including acute myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.

### The unreliability of crackles: insights from a breath sound study using physicians and artificial intelligence [^20d9beb6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study established the first breath sound database in the emergency department setting with clinical fidelity. Through double examination by both human experts and a deep learning model, the breath sound database was provided with relatively robust labels. Auscultation has long been criticized for its susceptibility to subjectivity and the observers’ abilities, which limits its clinical utility,,. While an increasing number of studies attempt to address these issues with artificial intelligence, it should be noted that different breath sounds not only influence human perception differently but also present varying complexities in signal processing and pattern recognition for machine learning. This study yielded two major findings: firstly, compared to wheezing, the identification of crackles proves to be more challenging and less prone to reaching a consensus. Secondly, despite employing multiple versions of deep learning models and adjustments in data sizes, the performance of crackle identification by deep learning still fell short compared to wheezing. Other auscultatory findings, such as heart murmurs, have been reported to exhibit good sensitivity and specificity, with AI achieving an AUC of 0.92 in detecting structural murmurs. Therefore, despite a fair AUROC, crackles remain unreliable for its low specificity, low inter-rater agreement, and potential for confusion with normal breath sounds. Further examination is warranted for accurate diagnosis and proper management.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9aaa2166]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Table 1—pointers to presence of specific cough in children lists abnormalities with example etiologies and notes the list is not exhaustive. Daily wet/productive cough is linked to protracted bacterial bronchitis, suppurative lung disease, recurrent aspiration, atypical infections, TB, and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Wheeze—monophonic indicates large airway obstruction (for example, from foreign body aspiration, malacia and/or stenosis, vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal tumors) and TB should be considered in selected settings (for example, high prevalence or HIV). Wheeze—polyphonic is associated with asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiolitis. Hoarse voice/stridor suggests laryngeal cleft/problems and airway abnormalities. Recurrent pneumonia is associated with immunodeficiency, atypical infections, suppurative lung disease, congenital lung abnormalities, and trachea-esophageal H-type fistulas. Hypoxia/cyanosis is linked to any airway or parenchyma disease and cardiac disease. Neurodevelopmental abnormality is associated with aspiration lung disease. Chest radiograph (other than peribronchial changes) or spirometry abnormality can reflect any cardiopulmonary disease. Growth failure indicates any serious systemic including pulmonary illness such as cystic fibrosis.

### The diagnostic value of physical examination and additional testing in primary care patients with suspected heart failure [^768e5d9b]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of nonacute heart failure is crucial because prompt initiation of evidence-based treatment can prevent or slow down further progression. To diagnose new-onset heart failure in primary care is challenging.

Methods and Results

This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with external validation. Seven hundred twenty-one consecutive patients suspected of new-onset heart failure underwent standardized diagnostic work-up including chest x-ray, spirometry, ECG, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement, and echocardiography in specially equipped outpatient diagnostic heart failure clinics. The presence of heart failure was determined by an outcome panel using the initial clinical data and 6-month follow-up data, blinded to biomarker data. Of the 721 patients, 207 (28.7%) had heart failure. The combination of 3 items from history (age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use) plus 6 from physical examination (pulse rate and regularity, displaced apex beat, rales, heart murmur, and increased jugular vein pressure) showed independent diagnostic value (c-statistic 0.83). NT-proBNP was the most powerful supplementary diagnostic test, increasing the c-statistic to 0.86 and resulting in net reclassification improvement of 69% (P<0.0001). A simplified diagnostic rule was applied to 2 external validation datasets, resulting in c- statistics of 0.95 and 0.88, confirming the results.

Conclusions

In this study, we estimated the quantitative diagnostic contribution of elements of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of heart failure in primary care outpatients, which may help to improve clinical decision making. The largest additional quantitative diagnostic contribution to those elements was provided by measurement of NT-proBNP. For daily practice, a diagnostic rule was derived that may be useful to quantify the probability of heart failure in patients with new symptoms suggestive of heart failure.

### Pulmonary congestion on lung ultrasound in ambulatory patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^9a809aa9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection of pulmonary congestion among ambulatory patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is critical to optimize decongestive therapy before overt decompensation, yet traditional tools are insensitive. We sought to examine the prevalence of B-lines, an ultrasound measure of pulmonary congestion, and their clinical and imaging correlates in patients with HFpEF.

Methods and Results

In a prospective, multisite observational study, using a pocket ultrasound device, 8-zone lung ultrasound examination was performed in outpatients with HFpEF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥45% and New York Heart Association functional class II through IV. B-lines and cardiac structure and function from echocardiograms were quantified off-line in core laboratories, blinded to clinical findings. Among 415 participants (mean age 74 years, 52% women, 51% obese, median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] 744 pg/mL) B-lines were detectable in 78% of patients ranging from 0 to 36 (median 3, interquartile range 1-6). There was a linear association between B-line count and log-transformed NT-proBNP (P < .001). Among patients in the highest tertile of B-lines, 76% had no crackles on auscultation, and 50% did not have elevated NT-proBNP levels. A higher B-line count was associated with larger sizes of cardiac chambers, greater left ventricular mass, higher filling pressures (E/e'), tricuspid regurgitant velocity, and inferior vena cava size, and worse right ventricular systolic function (P for trend < .05 for all), but not left ventricular ejection fraction.

Conclusions

Among ambulatory patients with HFpEF, lung ultrasound-detected B-lines were common, associated with NT-proBNP levels and clinically important echocardiographic features, and identified pulmonary congestion that was not always evident by auscultation.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^3ef266d0]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline—Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55-80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Fine crackles on chest auscultation in the early diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a prospective cohort study [^8b94fd49]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Electronic/digital analyses of lung sounds are a promising diagnostic tool in the identification of ILD. A study reported that the digital analyses of lung sounds had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 77% in identifying ‘velcro crackles’ in a small sample of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ILD,while others found them useful to predict the presence of reticulation and honeycombing on HRCT in patients with fibrotic lung diseasesand even to differentiate crackles due to IPF from crackles due to congestive heart failure and pneumonia.However, digital analyses of lung sounds require further validation before they can be incorporated in routine clinical practice for the diagnosis of ILD.

The present study has a number of limitations: the clinicians performing chest auscultation were medical residents, respirology fellows, ILD fellows and an attending respirologist; however, we did not include primary care physicians; therefore, the findings may not apply to them.

Clinicians participating in the study were asked to perform the chest auscultation as they normally do during their clinical assessments, using their own stethoscopes, and to report ‘fine crackles’ if they sounded either like ‘velcro’ or like the sound produced by ‘rubbing your hair between your fingers’. Lack of standardisation of a diagnostic test could decrease the internal validity of the results; despite this, in the present study, clinicians reported the presence of fine crackles in >90% of patients regardless of their level of training or experience. Similarly, almost 90% of patients who had fine crackles on the initial clinic visit also had them at the subsequent visit, even though half of clinicians were different, supporting the external validity of our results. Our study was performed in a single centre in Canada, which could limit the generalisability of the results, but the clinicians participating in our study were trained in different medical schools in North America, Europe and the Middle East, which would also increase the external validity of our results.
