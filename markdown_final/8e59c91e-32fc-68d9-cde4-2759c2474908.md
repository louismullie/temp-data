## Question

should this be the only thing ordered:CTA H/N shows no high-grade stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm.
mra brain/head with/without contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ordering a brain/head MRA with or without contrast is appropriate after a CTA head and neck already showed no high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm, and whether this MRA adds value or is redundant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context driving the request. Then, I should verify what CTA head and neck actually covers versus what brain/head MRA adds. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for repeating or adding vascular imaging. After that, I should assess diagnostic yield, redundancy, and potential harms. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note any exceptions where MRA might still be justified despite a negative CTA.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the appropriateness hinges on why the MRA is being ordered. In acute ischemic stroke or TIA, guidelines emphasize rapid noninvasive vascular imaging of the head and neck to identify large-vessel occlusion or high-grade stenosis and to guide reperfusion or revascularization decisions, and they generally do not recommend routine duplication of vascular imaging unless there is a specific question unresolved by the first study [^e5982969] [^9f999617] [^2161aac1]. In non-acute settings, vascular imaging is used for etiologic workup, secondary prevention planning, or aneurysm surveillance, and again, repeating imaging without a new clinical question is discouraged [^a089ae14] [^b6d189f8].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic coverage and diagnostic performance of CTA head and neck versus brain/head MRA. CTA head and neck typically evaluates the aortic arch through the skull base and intracranial circulation, including the circle of Willis and proximal intracranial segments, with high sensitivity and specificity for large-vessel occlusion and aneurysms, and it is the preferred modality in many acute stroke programs for speed and availability [^fbf3db23] [^df8576f3]. Brain/head MRA, whether TOF or contrast-enhanced, evaluates the intracranial arteries but generally does not adequately assess the cervical carotid and vertebral arteries, so it is not a substitute for head-and-neck CTA when extracranial disease is in question [^07f6e878] [^fbf3db23]. Hold on, I should verify the aneurysm point: modern CTA has excellent sensitivity for aneurysms, including small ones, so a negative CTA substantially lowers the pretest probability of a clinically significant aneurysm, though very small aneurysms can occasionally be missed and DSA remains the gold standard when suspicion remains high [^aa0683ae] [^50ddc875].

> I need to check guideline positions on repeating vascular imaging. The AHA/ASA stroke guidelines do not recommend routine repeat imaging of intracranial arteries solely to look for atherosclerotic stenosis after a comprehensive initial evaluation, and they advise reserving additional vascular imaging for selected cases where results will change management, such as unresolved questions about etiology or candidacy for specific therapies [^e50b6aca] [^0800b93e]. For unruptured aneurysm follow-up, MRA is reasonable, but that applies to known aneurysms, not to screening after a negative CTA, and repeating imaging after a negative high-quality CTA is not advised unless new symptoms or risk factors emerge [^b6d189f8] [^8d70b541]. The SVS extracranial guidelines similarly emphasize using duplex ultrasound first for carotid screening and reserving CTA/MRA for problem-solving or pre-intervention planning, not for routine duplication [^b9c7092e] [^59b758b8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should assess redundancy and potential harms. Duplicative CTA/MRA pairs in the ED are common and often not radiologist-recommended, and they add length of stay and cost without improving outcomes when the first study is definitive, which supports avoiding routine second vascular studies in the absence of a new clinical question [^e08a38a4]. MRA can miss or overestimate stenosis compared with CTA in some contexts, and repeating a vascular study can delay care, increase radiation if CTA is repeated, and add contrast exposure, so the balance of benefit and harm favors avoiding redundancy unless a specific diagnostic gap is identified [^5ef65a0b] [^c3cb5ae5].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where MRA still helps despite a negative CTA? I should double-check those. If the CTA was technically limited by artifact, poor contrast, or incomplete coverage, then targeted MRA or repeat CTA may be reasonable to clarify a specific segment or suspected lesion, particularly if symptoms persist or if the clinical picture suggests an intracranial process not fully characterized by the initial study [^e08a38a4] [^fbf3db23]. In suspected cervical artery dissection with subtle extracranial findings, MRA or CTA of the neck may be needed even if the brain MRA is unrevealing, because the pathology is extracranial and may be missed by a brain-only study [^bbc1f175]. In aneurysm surveillance after treatment, MRA is appropriate, but that is a different use-case than screening after a negative CTA [^b6d189f8]. In children or when radiation avoidance is prioritized, MRA is preferred, but again, that is a modality-selection principle rather than a reason to duplicate studies [^3fd30e70].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Given a high-quality CTA head and neck that already excluded high-grade stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm, a brain/head MRA with or without contrast is generally redundant and low yield unless there is a new clinical question, a technical limitation of the CTA, or a specific intracranial vascular issue that the CTA could not address. Routine ordering of MRA in this scenario is not supported by guidelines and may cause delays and unnecessary exposure without changing management [^e50b6aca] [^e08a38a4] [^fbf3db23]. I should confirm that the recommendation aligns with appropriateness criteria and stroke pathways, which consistently prioritize obtaining the right study once and acting on it rather than layering duplicative vascular imaging [^b876ae84] [^e5982969].

> Final recommendation: No, a brain/head MRA with or without contrast should not be the only thing ordered after a negative CTA head and neck, because the CTA already comprehensively evaluated the extracranial and intracranial circulation for the key pathologies and a routine repeat vascular study is not indicated. MRA should be reserved for unresolved clinical questions, technical limitations of the CTA, or specific surveillance scenarios, not for routine duplication after a definitive negative CTA [^e50b6aca] [^fbf3db23] [^e08a38a4].

In most cases, **MRA brain/head is not needed** if CTA head/neck is negative for high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm, because CTA already provides high-quality evaluation of the intracranial and extracranial vasculature [^fbf3db23] [^16d0495c]. MRA is only indicated if there is a **specific clinical concern** that CTA could miss — such as subtle intracranial stenosis, small aneurysms (< 3 mm), or vascular malformations — or if CTA was limited by artifact, contrast issues, or patient factors (e.g. severe calcification, renal impairment) [^f9043227] [^07f6e878]. Routine MRA after a negative CTA is not recommended and may add unnecessary cost, time, and radiation or contrast exposure [^e08a38a4].

## Diagnostic capabilities of CTA head and neck

CTA is a **rapid, widely available** modality that provides high-resolution imaging of the intracranial and extracranial vasculature, including the circle of Willis, carotid bifurcation, and vertebral arteries [^fbf3db23]. It is highly sensitive and specific for detecting high-grade stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysms, with reported sensitivities and specificities often exceeding 90% for clinically significant lesions [^df8576f3] [^aa0683ae]. CTA is particularly advantageous for:

- **Rapid acquisition**: Essential in acute stroke settings, allowing quick decision-making for thrombolysis or thrombectomy [^e5982969].
- **High spatial resolution**: Effective for detecting small aneurysms and detailed vascular anatomy [^c9ba016e].
- **Calcification assessment**: Useful for evaluating calcified plaques, which can be underestimated by MRA [^5ef65a0b].

---

## Diagnostic capabilities of MRA brain/head

MRA is a **non-invasive** alternative to CTA, particularly useful when radiation or iodinated contrast is a concern [^07f6e878]. It provides good visualization of intracranial vessels and is sensitive to flow-related phenomena, making it useful for detecting stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysms. However, MRA has certain limitations compared to CTA, including:

- **Lower spatial resolution**: May miss small aneurysms (< 3 mm) or subtle vascular abnormalities [^f9043227].
- **Longer acquisition time**: Less suitable in acute settings where rapid imaging is critical [^e5982969].
- **Gadolinium contrast risks**: Particularly in patients with renal impairment or gadolinium allergy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where MRA may be indicated despite negative CTA

While CTA is highly effective, certain clinical scenarios may warrant additional MRA despite a negative CTA:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for mra** |
|-|-|
| Suspected small aneurysm (< 3 mm) | CTA may miss very small aneurysms due to limited spatial resolution [^f9043227] |
| Suspected intracranial stenosis or vasculitis | MRA can provide additional detail on vessel wall abnormalities and flow dynamics [^a7ca038d] |
| Contraindications to iodinated contrast (e.g. severe allergy, renal impairment) | MRA without contrast is a safer alternative [^07f6e878] |
| Artifact or technical limitations on CTA | MRA can help clarify equivocal findings or artifacts [^e08a38a4] |

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on clinical context. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA to identify large vessel occlusion or stenosis, but do not recommend routine repeat imaging if the initial study is negative and there is no ongoing clinical suspicion [^e5982969] [^2161aac1]. Similarly, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines recommend duplex ultrasound as the initial imaging modality for carotid stenosis, with CTA or MRA reserved for specific indications or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^b9c7092e] [^59b758b8].

---

## Potential risks and drawbacks of unnecessary MRA

Ordering unnecessary MRA after a negative CTA can have several **negative consequences**:

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary imaging adds financial burden to patients and healthcare systems [^e08a38a4].
- **Prolonged diagnostic process**: Additional imaging can delay diagnosis and treatment, particularly in acute settings [^e08a38a4].
- **Patient discomfort and anxiety**: Additional imaging can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety for patients.
- **Contrast-related risks**: Gadolinium-based contrast agents carry risks, particularly in patients with renal impairment [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **MRA brain/head is generally not indicated** if CTA head/neck is negative for high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. CTA provides comprehensive evaluation of the intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and routine MRA in this context is unlikely to add clinically significant information. MRA should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios where CTA is limited or contraindicated, or when there is a strong clinical suspicion of pathology that CTA may miss. Clinicians should base imaging decisions on individual patient factors, clinical suspicion, and guideline recommendations to avoid unnecessary testing and potential harm.

Aneurysm follow-up — patients treated without surgery or coiling: imaging interval and modality selection emphasize early imaging and noncontrast options. Most published work indicates a preference for first follow-up imaging 6 to 12 months after initial discovery, and continued follow-up is then generally recommended yearly or every 2 years once stability is documented. Both CTA and MRA have been used for follow-up. In general, because a TOF MRA does not require intravenous contrast and does not involve x-ray radiation, this may be the most appropriate first-line method for repeated imaging follow-up, while for patients with contraindications to MRA or whose aneurysm(s) cannot be suitably visualized with this technique, CTA remains a viable alternative. When a patient's age or medical comorbidities make invasive intervention inordinately high risk or of no significant benefit, it may be reasonable to discontinue further scheduled follow-up.

### Multisystem factors contributing to redundant intracranial vascular imaging in the ED [^e08a38a4]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the multisystem factors contributing to redundant neurovascular orders in the ED.

Methods

This was an IRB-approved, retrospective study, performed at a single institution examining a 5-year history of redundant CTA/MRA head and neck (HN) exams performed in the ED for patients with no documented clinical change in mental status/neurological exam necessitating additional imaging. Factors contributing to redundant ordering including provider experience, synchronous order placement, and radiologist recommendations were examined. Additionally, the impact of duplicative imaging in terms of medical cost and ED length of stay was evaluated.

Results

250 patients met inclusion criteria with both CTA/MRA of the HN performed during a single ED encounter (total 500 exams). 190 (76%) redundant exams were not recommended by a radiologist and contributed to an added ED length of stay of 3.6 h on average. Provider experience was not a significant contributing factor. 60 (24%) of redundant exams were recommended by a radiologist and were most frequently CTAs needed to clarify an area of artifact/high-grade stenosis/occlusion on a primary MRA exam.

Conclusion

Evaluation of contributing factors to redundant CTA/MRA HN exams ordering has highlighted multiple associated factors including provider experience, recommendations by radiologists for clarification of MRA findings, as well as systems processes related to synchronous CTA/MRA order placement.

Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease — implications and imaging accuracy: Identification of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease suggests potential treatment to aggressive antiatherosclerotic targets and is often seen as an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Both MRA and CTA have been shown to reliably exclude high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) when digital subtraction catheter angiography was used as the reference test, and early identification of symptomatic extracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis identifies patients at high risk of recurrent stroke.

Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) imaging — adult screening, modality roles, and follow-up is described, noting a high false positive rate "up to 47.9 percent" especially with Grade I BCVI, and that in this patient population "it is recommended to re-evaluate the patient with MDCTA in 7–10 days or proceed with DSA to confirm diagnosis". "DSA is now usually reserved for the patient who requires an endovascular intervention or when a complex lesion needs to be more clearly defined, and when findings on CTA are equivocal or are negative and clinical suspicion remains high". Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) "requires a longer imaging time and a potential need for sedation that limits its application as a screening study for patients with critical injuries" and, for BCVI screening at the time of brain MRI, "is judged to be inferior to CTA by the American College of Radiology (ACR), with an assigned appropriateness criteria of 5 (a score of 9 is most appropriate and 1 is least appropriate)". Follow-up is emphasized: "Follow up imaging is needed to reassess the patient diagnosed with BCVI", with timing that "remains controversial and varies from 1 week to 3 months, depending of the grade of injury and the clinical condition of the patient".

### American Heart Association issues guidelines on imaging… [^11d7d8ae]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

CT of the head has only a limited role in the evaluation of patients with transient monocular blindness. CT of the head has a limited role in the evaluation of patients with vertebrobasilar TIAs, as subdural hematoma or brain tumor is not known to present with transient symptoms resembling posterior circulation ischemia. CT can detect areas of appropriate cerebellar or, less commonly, brainstem infarction, a finding that in selected instances may alter clinical management. In addition, CT may show evidence of severe atherosclerotic disease in the vertebrobasilar system, such as dolichoectasia of the basilar artery, as a potential mechanism of TIAs. In some instances, complete occlusion by noninvasive tests may need confirmation or exclusion by conventional arteriography.

The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial have proved the benefit of endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis with more than 70 percent luminal reduction as measured on cerebral arteriographic images. Cerebral arteriography may also be required when a diagnosis of dissection, vasculitis, aneurysm or embolism needs confirmation or exclusion. Recommendations in Acute Stroke There is general agreement to strongly recommend CT of the head without contrast enhancement as the initial brain imaging procedure in patients with acute stroke. A follow-up CT of the head without contrast enhancement two to seven days after stroke onset is recommended when the initial CT scan result is negative and documentation of the presence, location and extension of the ischemic infarction is needed, or when clinically significant hemorrhagic transformation is suspected.

Recommendations in Subarachnoid Hemorrh age Noncontrast CT of the head is strongly recommended as the initial procedure for the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Selective catheter cerebral angiography is the recommended procedure for the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm as the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 1-weighted images, T 2 and gradient echocardiographic axial images and three-dimensional phase-contrast or time-of-flight MRA are suggested. When MRI and MRA are not available, contrast-enhanced CT of the brain and, in particular, conventional angiography are diagnostic options to be used independently or in combination to advance the diagnosis of deep vein, cortical vein or dural sinus thrombosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, CTA/MRA, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining MRI and MRA to establish a non-macrovascular cause of ICH (such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, deep perforating vasculopathy, cavernous malformation, or malignancy) in patients with spontaneous ICH with a negative CTA/venography.

Indications for MRA of the head and neck — adult and pediatric scope — MRI/MRA is the primary imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of the head and neck vasculature in children, and it is a noninvasive and low-risk examination free of ionizing radiation as compared with conventional endovascular or CT angiographic procedures. Studies of pediatric stroke that compared MRA with conventional angiography found MRA to be accurate in delineating stenosis and/or occlusion and able to demonstrate vascular anatomy in a variety of pathological conditions, and in some clinical instances follow-up CT or catheter angiography may be necessary to further characterize the abnormality or provide therapy. Indications for MRA of the head and neck include, but are not limited to, the detection and evaluation of atherosclerotic or nonatherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease, thromboembolism, or vasospasm in the setting of acute or chronic cerebral ischemia, and infarction.

### CTA of the ICA bifurcation and intracranial vessels [^b5a208ed]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

With multislice CT scanners, CT angiography is increasingly becoming a diagnostic tool for supraaortal (extra- and intracranial) vessel pathology. There are three different fields in which CTA might replace invasive DSA and even compete with MRI techniques. In intracranial aneurysms CTA has a high diagnostic accuracy with a very small number of false negative results. The cutoff aneurysm size is approximately 3 to 4 mm, and nearly 99% of ruptured aneurysms can be recognized by CTA. In ICA stenosis CTA is obviously more accurate than MRA, because it does not have the inherent error of stenosis overestimation and has the additional advantage of visualisation of calcification. Specifically, the latter is a major advantage if one has to decide between stenting and surgical repair of the stenosis. In acute stroke, the combination of tissue and vessel imaging with MR techniques is obviously better than CT technology. However, MR is not always available everywhere. In these cases, the combination of a brain CT and CTA of the supra-aortal vessels might be a good alternative, specifically if thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic option. In summary, CTA clearly can replace DSA for many diagnostic purposes and will even replace MRA in patients with ICA stenosis.

### A practical approach to CT angiography of the neck and brain [^edaa58a6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a rapidly developing technology with great potential. This is particularly true for evaluating neurovascular disease. Clinical stroke because of atherosclerotic disease of the carotid and vertebral arteries is a common examination indication; areas of stenosis, and soft and calcified plaque along the entire vessel, not only at the carotid bifurcation, permit a full assessment of the patient's disease process. Other diseases including dissection, trauma, intracranial stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can be readily diagnosed. Although duplex ultrasound may be a first line examination in many patients, both magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CTA offer distinct advantages over it. CTA and MRA are both highly accurate but CTA has several key advantages. CTA has been advanced by the development of improved multidetector CT (MDCT) and workstations that postprocess the data. Methods to obtain quality CTA images and to rapidly analyze the data for abnormalities are the subject of this chapter. In addition, evolving techniques in future CT scanners and workstations, and developing methods of vulnerable plaque and CT perfusion imaging are discussed.

Preprocedural care — radiological evaluation specifies that neurological imaging may be reasonably performed using CT/CTA or MRI/MRA, as dictated by institutional protocol, resource availability, and patient condition, and at a minimum neurological imaging should be sufficient to allow identification of intracranial hemorrhage, extent of completed infarction, and location of vessel occlusion. Additional neurological imaging for assessment of ischemic penumbra, such as perfusion imaging or multiphase CTA, may be performed as necessary, and particularly in patients 6 to 24 hours after symptom onset/last known well; neurological imaging necessary for therapeutic decision making in the acute phase should be performed expediently, results should be communicated to other members of the stroke team expediently, to the extent possible, effort should made to minimize the time elapsed between patient arrival and completion of neurological imaging, and any radiological studies that are not necessary for decision making in the acute phase but would delay acute therapies should be deferred. Administration of iodinated contrast should not be delayed on account of unavailable serum creatinine result.

Future research — CT/LP versus CT/CTA evidence gaps and alternative pathways: Evidence directly comparing strategies is limited; "Only 1 quality study was identified in the literature search for this critical question", and "this study was limited by the low number of patients with SAH". Research is proposed to identify "patients who may not need additional testing (LP or CTA) after a negative noncontrast head CT result", with emphasis on "identifying risk factors for significant SAH and developing pretest probabilities for individual patients". An alternative pathway is "the use of CTA only without noncontrast head CT", which "may decrease time and radiation exposure", but "studies addressing the safety, risks, and benefits of this alternative strategy are warranted". Because "the most significant negative issue in regard to the use of CTA is the potential for finding an incidental cerebral aneurysm", studies to differentiate "a clinically significant aneurysm from an incidental one" are needed, and "one such strategy might be the performance of LP after CTA identifies a cerebral aneurysm".

Suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) imaging during initial emergency department workup: For the question of what imaging can be safely delayed, "Level A recommendations. None specified". and "Level B recommendations. None specified". Level C states: "(1) The safety of delaying neuroimaging from the initial ED workup is unknown. If noncontrast brain MRI is not readily available, it is reasonable for physicians to obtain a noncontrast head CT as part of the initial TIA workup to identify TIA mimics (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion). However, noncontrast head CT should not be used to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". Additionally, "(2) When feasible, physicians should obtain MRI with DWI to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". and "(3) When feasible, physicians should obtain cervical vascular imaging (eg, carotid ultrasonography, CTA, or MRA) to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke". The potential benefit described is that "Immediate noncontrast head CT or noncontrast brain MRI may identify life-threatening TIA mimics in the ED".

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^77592504]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for selection of carotid imaging modalities — Carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) in an accredited vascular laboratory is the initial diagnostic imaging of choice for evaluating the severity of stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and unequivocal identification of stenosis of 50% to 99% in neurologically symptomatic patients or 70% to 99% in asymptomatic patients is sufficient to make a decision regarding intervention (GRADE I, Level of Evidence A). CDUS in an accredited vascular laboratory is the imaging modality of choice to screen asymptomatic populations at high risk (GRADE I, Level of Evidence B). When CDUS is nondiagnostic or suggests stenosis of intermediate severity (50% to 69%) in an asymptomatic patient, additional imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is required before embarking on any intervention (GRADE I, Level of Evidence B). When evaluation of vessels proximal or distal to the cervical carotid arteries is needed for diagnosis or to plan therapy, imaging with CTA, MRA, or catheter angiography in addition to CDUS is indicated, and CTA is preferable to MR or MRA for delineating calcium.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^6e5c11e0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Comparison of CDUS, MRA, CTA, and DSA — Color duplex ultrasound (CDUS) is described as the preferred imaging modality for identifying patients with 70% to 99% stenosis and is the preferred imaging modality for the identification of asymptomatic stenosis. Accuracy concerns exist for diagnosing 50% to 69% stenosis, with a sensitivity of only 36% and a specificity of 91%. In neurologically symptomatic patients, a CDUS diagnosis of 50% to 69% stenosis is sufficient to proceed with surgery based on specificity, whereas in neurologically asymptomatic patients, a moderate stenosis (50% to 69%) diagnosed by CDUS should be confirmed by another imaging study before intervention is undertaken.

### Acute shortage of iodinated contrast media: implications and guidance for neurovascular imaging and intervention [^8bac8d3a]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Other strategies for reduction of imaging exams in the acute stroke patient include direct to angiography approach which may be reasonable in patients presenting from the field with high pre-hospital stroke scales or in transfer patients. As stroke centers may have automated protocols to conduct CTA and/or CTP for all stroke patients for the detection of LVO, there are subgroups of patients where an algorithmic approach to determining the low likelihood of LVO candidates may render the CTA study unnecessary. Patients who have low NIHSS (i.e. isolated facial droop, isolated dysarthria, and isolated dizziness) have a low likelihood of LVO and can be triaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) protocols. Patients with completed territorial infarctions (i.e. complete middle cerebral artery infarction) may not need CTA nor CTP imaging as this will likely not change management. These interpretations and reduction of imaging decisions for the acute stroke patient would require a physician to be knowledgeable of the patient's brief history and exam, interpret the images in the control room while the patient is in the CT scan, to make step-wise triage decisions.

In patients who present with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), it is common practice to perform CTA followed by DSA. Advantages of performing CTA in the workup of SAH include aneurysm treatment planning (i.e. the patient is intubated up front in the angio suite if they are a good candidate for coiling), external ventricular drain trajectory planning, and in high-risk patients, understanding the atherosclerotic burden with catheterization risk. However, in other centers, it is common practice to perform CT followed by direct to four-vessel angiography for aneurysm detection and treatment, which obviates an extra contrast study (i.e. CTA) altogether.

Alternative imaging modalities such as MRI or MRA can replace contrast CT examinations in most cases for the head and neck. However, most centers have waiting lists for this modality. The availability of MRI could be optimized by deferring other examinations and implementation of a 24/7 on-call duty. Despite the limited study situation, MRI, if it can be performed without substantial delay, may also be considered for evaluation of patients before thrombectomy in high-performing centers. In patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 3D time of flight MRA (rather than CTA head) would likely suffice in the majority of patients to characterize the aneurysm, facilitate treatment decision-making, and inform long-term aneurysm follow-up.

Adult suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) — carotid ultrasonography accuracy versus neck computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified. Level C recommendations. In adult patients with suspected TIA, carotid ultrasonography may be used to exclude severe carotid stenosis because it has accuracy similar to that of MRA or CTA. Screening for severe carotid stenosis by ultrasonography has the potential to reduce cost and exposure to radiation and contrast compared with CTA or MRA, but the use of carotid ultrasonography may miss a small percentage of patients with severe carotid stenosis.

### Noninvasive imaging of treated cerebral aneurysms, part II: CT angiographic follow-up of surgically clipped aneurysms [^1f902505]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Although not useful for the evaluation of coiled aneurysms, CT angiography (CTA) is far superior to MR angiography (MRA) for the evaluation of aneurysms after surgical clipping. Using the latest multidetector row scanners and optimized imaging parameters, CTA can often effectively depict and follow small aneurysm remnants; demonstrate patency, stenosis, or vasospasm in the adjacent parent vessels; and provide surveillance of the entire cerebrovasculature for de novo aneurysms after surgical clipping. Despite these advances, conventional angiography remains the gold standard for the evaluation of surgically treated aneurysms and should be liberally used to resolve any cases of diagnostic uncertainty on noninvasive imaging.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8d70b541]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing/imaging for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) includes the following guideline statements: digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can be useful compared with noninvasive imaging for identification and evaluation of cerebral aneurysms if surgical or endovascular treatment is being considered (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), and DSA is reasonable as the most sensitive imaging for follow-up of treated aneurysms (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are useful for detection and follow-up of UIA (Class I; Level of Evidence B), and it is reasonable to perform MRA as an alternative for follow-up for treated aneurysms, with DSA used as necessary when deciding on therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Coiled aneurysms, especially those with wider neck or dome diameters or those that have residual filling, should have follow-up evaluation (Class I; Level of Evidence B). The timing and duration of follow-up is uncertain, and additional investigation is necessary. The importance of surveillance imaging after endovascular treatment of UIAs, including high-risk features for recurrence remains unclear, but surveillance imaging is probably indicated (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^99fbe709]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) — diagnostic approach and imaging selection: There are inadequate data to recommend one imaging modality over another for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular FMD. Catheter-based angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard; however, in most centers, this modality has been replaced by CTA or contrast-enhanced MRA as the initial imaging modality, and it is typically reserved for complicated cases that may require intervention such as repair of an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm related to dissection, or rare cases of hemispheric neurological symptoms despite medical therapy with severe stenosis. In high‑volume centers with experience in vascular duplex ultrasonography for carotid FMD, it is reasonable to start with a carotid duplex exam. The lack of specific symptoms presents challenges because up to 25% of women in the general population may experience migraine headaches in their lifetime, and American Academy of Neurology guidelines advocate for neuroimaging for patients with migraine who have neurologic findings on physical examination or a change in the quality or severity of headache, but this approach would potentially miss a sizable portion of patients with FMD because this neuroimaging does not necessarily include the cervical arteries.

Vascular imaging in ischemic stroke — The measure tracks the "Percentage of patients with ischemic stroke and who meet clinical criteria for mechanical thrombectomy who have vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) within one hour of their initial non-contrast CT brain"; the numerator is "Patients with ischemic stroke and who meet clinical criteria for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) who have vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) within one hour of their initial non-contrast CT brain". The denominator includes "All ischemic stroke patients who present for emergency evaluation and who meet criteria for mechanical thrombectomy", excluding " < 18 years of age", "Intracranial hemorrhage on initial imaging", "Other criteria that makes ischemic stroke patient ineligible for mechanical thrombectomy including findings on initial non-contrast brain CT", "Length of stay > 120 days", and "Documented Comfort Measures Only status prior to stroke evaluation". The period of assessment is "Acute hospitalization – day of admission". Rationale states MT is effective for large vessel occlusion identified on CTA or MRA "within 24 hours of symptom onset", so "vascular imaging should be expedited in this population", and "Thrombolysis with t-PA should not be delayed due to CTA or MRA"; for consistency, "this measure allows a maximum of one hour between initial non-contrast CT brain and CTA or MRA".

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^7bacf07f]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Imaging evaluation in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — MRI and MRA may provide valuable information on DSA-negative ICH causes, and blood-sensitive T2✱-weighted sequences should be included to detect brain microbleeds or cortical superficial siderosis. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI should be included to exclude neoplasm or other underlying mass lesion and is often repeated after 3 to 6 months. In the DIAGRAM study, the median interval between CTA and MRI/MRA was 46 days, and the diagnostic yield of combined CTA and MRI/MRA was 18%. Both CTA and MRA appear to have good sensitivity and specificity after ICH for the detection of intracranial vascular malformations, but there is no head-to-head comparison to guide modality choice. Nonenhanced CT also can be used to detect ICH features suggestive of CAA such as subarachnoid extension or finger-like projects and features of all small vessel diseases such as white matter hypodensity. Rapid identification of any underlying intracranial vascular malformation or cerebral venous thrombosis is important and will influence treatment strategies and outcome.

### Neuroimaging for neurovascular complications of traumatic brain injury [^a23af534]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

However, all in it, these findings shed the light on a different scenario where trauma patients with multiple systems injuries and at risk of hemorrhagic complications might be inappropriately treated with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies.

In these instances, DSA might be considered to confirm CTA findings.

Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR-Angiography (MRA) are less frequently acquired in the emergency setting due to the concern for metallic foreign bodies related to trauma, longer acquisition times and sensitivity to motion artifacts. Despite these limitations, MRI can improve diagnosis of BCVI. For instance, in low-grade lesions with equivocal BCVI on CTA, MRI with vessel wall imaging allowing for direct visualization of arterial wall might improve diagnostic accuracy of BCVI.

When to image

The increasing adoption of screening criteria and a more strict neurological evaluation especially in critical care has improved the detection of BCVI, with a concomitant reduction of BCVI-related ischemic stroke and mortality over the last three decades. In particular, the occurrence of stroke has consistently decreased over the years from 37% to about 4,8% of patients with BCVI.

A collaborative approach of neurointensivists and neuroradiologists should help in recognizing the instances which require to proceed with CTA in a trauma patient after a plain CT head.

The European Society of Emergency Radiology guidelines on radiological polytrauma imaging state that the neck region should be included in the whole body tomography scan with intravenous contrast medium in such a way that the neck arteries and brain base arteries are well opacified.

A meta-analysis of 28 studies comparing CTA with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) reported pooled sensitivity 85% and specificity 93% for detecting 70% to 99% carotid stenosis, and sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 98% for occlusions. CTA accurately identifies calcification but is less reliable for plaque morphology, especially lipid component or ulceration, and appears less reliable than DUS or MRA for assessing plaque morphology; other limitations include cost (compared with DUS), contrast exposure, radiation exposure, and reduced contrast–calcium discrimination with heavy calcification during postprocessing.

Society for Vascular Surgery visceral aneurysm — diagnosis and evaluation: In patients who are thought to have GDAA and PDAA, we recommend CTA as the diagnostic tool of choice; in patients in whom celiac stenosis is suspected, we suggest further workup with duplex ultrasound to elucidate whether the stenosis is hemodynamically significant; and in patients with high radiation exposure risks or renal insufficiency, we suggest non-contrast-enhanced MRA for diagnosis. Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and women of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, or gadolinium contrast material allergy).

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^91bfdbcb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis screening — diagnostic performance and test roles: Outcomes emphasize sensitivity and specificity in identification of ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% carotid stenosis. Duplex ultrasound has robust sensitivity 85%-92% and specificity 84%, and consensus criteria include a cutoff internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity ≥ 125 cm/s to denote angiographic stenosis ≥ 50%. Using these criteria, the reported sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of duplex ultrasound in predicting 50% to 69% or ≥ 70% stenosis were 93%, 68%, and 85% and 99%, 86%, and 95%, respectively. The major limitations of duplex ultrasound include dependence on a skilled operator and inability to completely image the proximal and intracranial vasculature. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images that can rival formal arteriography but has no role, however, in screening for carotid artery disease, owing to its considerable expense. Multidimensional computed tomographic angiography (CTA) can evaluate soft tissue, bone, and vascular structures simultaneously, yet is not appropriate for screening purposes because of its significant cost and the degree of radiation exposure. Catheter arteriography was previously the reference standard but has no role in screening for extracranial cerebrovascular disease because of its invasive nature and risk of complications.

### ACR-ASNR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of endovascular thrombectomy and revascularization in acute stroke [^d49a5e8b]. SIR/ACR/ASNR/SNIS (2024). High credibility.

ACR–ASNR–SIR–SNIS practice parameter — Acute ischemic stroke vascular imaging and IV thrombolysis timing: Although MRI/MR angiography (MRA) and CT/CT angiography (CTA) can both be used, most centers will likely perform CT/CTA. Although CTA adds time, its benefits for clinical decision making outweigh risks and reduce time from imaging to decision making for endovascular management. Thrombolytic therapy can be started immediately following the noncontrast CT while the CTA is being planned, and in centers with appropriate safety protocols this can be done with the patient remaining in the CT scanner and has been shown to reduce door to needle times. Sites without immediate access to CTA should perform a noncontrast CT to ensure IV thrombolytic therapy decision making is not unduly delayed and should not delay appropriate care to complete the CTA.

In a pediatric patient with an isolated headache or a classic migraine unaccompanied by neurologic signs, presence of a seizure, or supporting historical data, an imaging workup is usually not indicated. For a sudden severe headache or a headache with positive neurologic signs or symptoms or supporting historical data, MRI or CT should be considered. For the acute severe (thunderclap) headache, CTA, MRA, or catheter angiography may be appropriate.

Examination specifications for head and neck MRA — the written or electronic request should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination and allow for proper performance and interpretation. Documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes signs and symptoms and/or relevant history (including known diagnoses), and providing additional information such as the specific reason for the examination or a provisional diagnosis would be helpful and may at times be needed to allow for the proper performance and interpretation.

### Arterial obstruction on computed tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography and response to intravenous thrombolytics in ischemic stroke [^d657d4f3]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is significantly more effective in improving functional outcome in patients presenting with ischemic stroke who have arterial obstruction than in those with apparently patent arteries on CTA or MRA. Intravenous thrombolytics, therefore, remain an important treatment option. The data are too sparse to determine, in this analysis, whether patients without apparent arterial obstruction benefit from intravenous thrombolytics, bearing in mind that these patients may have thrombus too small to detect on CTA or MRA.

### ACR-ASNR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck [^16d0495c]. ACR/SPR/ASNR (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck CTA indications — Indications include diagnosis, characterization, and/or surveillance of arterial aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms, venous varices, and dissections; ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, vasospasm, and thromboembolism (including collateral assessment); acute hemorrhage in the head or neck; atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease including atherosclerotic plaque localization and characterization; nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vasculopathy including radiation vasculopathy; vasculitis and collagen vascular diseases; traumatic vascular injuries; venous and dural sinus thrombosis; vascular malformations and fistulas; pulsatile tinnitus; vascular anatomic variants; evaluation for vascular intervention and follow-up (percutaneous and surgical); tumors of vascular origin with rich vascular supply or involving vascular structures; surgical and radiation therapy localization, planning, and neuronavigation; assessment for vascular compression (eg bow-hunter's syndrome and Eagle syndrome); brain death in certain jurisdictions (especially when used in conjunction with other testing); and postsurgical/posttreatment vascular complications. For certain indications, "it may be appropriate to limit CTA to include only the head to avoid unnecessary radiation to the patient", and for pregnancy, "see the ACR–SPR Practice Parameter for Imaging Pregnant or Potentially Pregnant Patients with Ionizing Radiation".

### Latest techniques in head and neck CT angiography [^c9ba016e]. Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

Continuous evolution of multi row CT is increasingly making CT angiography a viable imaging modality for assessment of the supraaortic and intracranial vessels as an anatomically and functionally coherent vascular system. Extended non-invasive examinations with reduced contrast volume have become feasible with the availability of 16 and 64 row MDCT scanners. Prerequisites to obtain high resolution CT angiographies of the head and neck vessels with superior detail include the administration of low contrast volume, high contrast density (400 mg I/ml) contrast media, adequate timing and data acquisition, optimal flow rate (4 ml/s) and saline flushing. Non-invasiveness, delineation of vessel calcification, virtual independence from hemodynamic conditions, and the ability to provide quantification without needing to correct for magnification are all attributes that favour CT angiography over digital subtraction angiography and to some extent even magnetic resonance angiography as an alternative non-invasive technique. CT angiography is established as a modality of choice for the assessment of patients with acute stroke and chronic steno-occlusive disease. CT angiography may indicate the presence of extra- or intracranial acute vessel occlusion and dissection, predisposing atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease and thus indicate thrombo-embolism or local appositional thrombosis as the principle pathogenic factor. CT angiography is used to assess anatomy, and to depict the presence, location and extent of calcified and non-calcified plaque as a cause of high grade stenosis. Despite relatively limited sensitivity CT angiography is indicated for suspected or confirmed aneurysms that demand further verification of their presence, geometry, or relationship to parent artery branches and osseous anatomic landmarks. Low volume high density contrast media have substantially increased the ability of CT angiography to depict small aneurysms, small branches, and collateral vessels, and to recognize the residual lumen in vessels with high grade stenosis or conditions such as dissection or pseudo-occlusion. Superior detail high resolution CT angiography is thus a viable alternative to DSA, relegating the latter technique to endovascular treatment applications only.

### ACR-NASCI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [^0ba28741]. SPR/NASCI/ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR–NASCI–SPR practice parameter for body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) — scope and clinical framing emphasizes that the document is an educational tool, not a legal standard, and that clinical judgment remains paramount while outlining MRA's role and modalities. It states that Practice Parameters and Technical Standards are not inflexible rules and are not intended to establish a legal standard of care, and that adherence to guidance does not assure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome; rather, practitioners should follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, resources, and patient needs. It also describes MRA as a proven and useful tool for initial diagnosis, severity assessment, and follow-up of vascular diseases, and notes that MRA techniques are categorized as noncontrast and contrast enhanced.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^aa0683ae]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) — With modern-generation scanners compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with 3D rotational acquisition, one report indicated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.3%, 100%, and 94.6%, respectively, with smaller aneurysms (those < 3 mm) showing 81.8%, 100%, and 93.3%, respectively. A 2003 meta-analysis of 21 studies including 1251 patients reported sensitivity 93.3% and specificity 87.8% for CTA compared with DSA. CTA can be considered as an initial diagnostic test for aneurysm detection and screening, but artifacts from bone or metal and radiation concerns may limit its usefulness for long-term follow-up in treated aneurysms.

### Medical imaging in personalised medicine: a white paper of the research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^1daacc25]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Besides oncology, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are other areas where severity of disease influences treatment decisions. Specific examples are:
The decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms is based on the location and maximum diameter of the aneurysm.
Abdominal aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm are treated while smaller aneurysms are monitored during follow-up.
Atherosclerotic stenosis in coronary and peripheral arteries is considered symptomatic and is treated once the diameter stenosis is more than 50%.
The benefit of carotid endarterectomy has been proven for symptomatic stenosis of more than 70%. The carotid endarterectomy trials have used catheter angiography as the modality for the assessment of the severity of stenosis. US, CTA and MRA have replaced this technique after extensive validation as the accurate assessment of the severity of stenosis was crucial in treatment decisions. It is therefore not surprising that carotid stenosis is one of the most evaluated imaging biomarkers in radiology.

Tissue biopsy in interventional radiology

Final diagnosis of specific diseases and subsequent treatment allocation has been based on gross macroscopic, microscopic and/or immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue specimens. The best-known example is a tumour for which the most relevant question is the assessment of the malignant nature of the lesion and the type of malignancy. Collection of tissue samples for diagnosis can been performed by endoscopy or with a surgical procedure. US-, CT- or MRI-guided biopsy sampling is critical and most often represents the least invasive method to obtain relevant material for the in vitro diagnosis of disease in many parts of the body. Specific examples include:
MRI-guided or contrast-enhanced transrectal US-guided prostate biopsy, which appears to be a useful method for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with prior negative biopsy results.
US- and MRI-guided percutaneous breast biopsy, which has replaced surgical biopsy as the initial method of diagnosis for most breast lesions.

Tissue sampling is not only performed for a final pathologic diagnosis, but also for the evaluation of disease spread. Here, the confirmation of potential metastasis through image-guided tissue sampling may change the type of treatment offered, for example from surgery to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Specific examples include:
US-guided core biopsy of suspicious axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer allows for identification of metastatic nodes preoperatively.
CT-guided bone biopsy in patients with suspected bone metastasis supports a final diagnosis.
US-guided biopsy in sub-centimetre neck lymph nodes improves tumour staging in head and neck cancer.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^cc0f9344]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

AHA/ASA 2021 diagnostic evaluation for secondary stroke prevention — additional recommendations state that in patients with cryptogenic stroke, echocardiography with or without contrast is reasonable to evaluate for possible cardiac sources of or transcardiac pathways for cerebral embolism; in cryptogenic stroke without a contraindication to anticoagulation, long-term rhythm monitoring with mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, implantable loop recorder, or other approach is reasonable to detect intermittent atrial fibrillation; in suspected ischemic stroke, if CT or MRI does not demonstrate symptomatic cerebral infarct, follow-up CT or MRI of the brain is reasonable to confirm the diagnosis; in suspected TIA, if initial head imaging does not demonstrate a symptomatic cerebral infarct, follow-up MRI is reasonable to predict risk of early stroke and to support the diagnosis; in cryptogenic stroke, tests for hypercoagulable states, relevant infections, drug use, systemic inflammation markers, and genetic tests for inherited diseases associated with stroke are reasonable to perform as clinically indicated to identify contributors or relevant risk factors; in ischemic stroke or TIA, noninvasive imaging of intracranial large arteries and extracranial vertebrobasilar system with MRA or CTA can be effective to identify etiologically relevant vasculopathies; in ischemic stroke with a plan for anticoagulant therapy, CT or MRI of the brain before therapy is started may be considered to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and final size of infarction; in ESUS, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac CT, or cardiac MRI might be reasonable to identify possible cardioaortic sources or transcardiac pathways for cerebral embolism; and in ischemic stroke or TIA in whom PFO closure would be contemplated, TCD with embolus detection might be reasonable to screen for right-to-left shunt.

### Imaging-based decision making in thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: present status [^204dd62c]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for acute stroke within 3 hours after symptom onset. Treatment beyond the 3-hour time window has not been shown to be effective in any single trial; however, meta-analyses suggest a somewhat lesser but still significant effect within 3 to 6 hours after stroke. It seems reasonable to apply improved selection criteria that allow differentiation between patients with and without a relevant indication for thrombolytic therapy.

Summary Of Review

The present literature on imaging in stroke has been thoroughly reviewed, covering Doppler ultrasound (DU), arteriography, CT, and MRI and including modern techniques such as perfusion CT, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI, PWI), CT angiography and MR angiography (CTA, MRA), and CTA source image analysis (CTA-SI). The authors present their view of a comprehensive diagnostic approach to acute stroke, which challenges the concept of a rigid therapeutic time window.

Conclusions

Information about the presence or absence of a vessel occlusion, whether by means of DU, CTA, or MRA, is essential before recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is given in the 3- to 6-hour time window. Clear demarcation of the irreversibly damaged infarct core and the ischemic but still viable and thus salvageable tissue at risk of infarction as seen on DWI/PWI/MRA or alternatively CT/CTA/CTA-SI should be obtained before thrombolysis is initiated within 3 to 6 hours. Once these advanced techniques are used, the therapeutic time window can be extended with acceptable safety. However, comprehensive informed consent is mandatory, especially when thrombolytic therapy is considered beyond established time windows.

### EFNS guideline on neuroimaging in acute stroke. report of an EFNS task force [^95cea17c]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging techniques are necessary for the evaluation of stroke, one of the leading causes of death and neurological impairment in developed countries. The multiplicity of techniques available has increased the complexity of decision making for physicians. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature in English for the period 1965–2005 and critically assessed the relevant publications. The members of the panel reviewed and corrected an initial draft, until a consensus was reached on recommendations stratified according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) criteria. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan is the established imaging procedure for the initial evaluation of stroke patients. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity than CT for the demonstration of infarcted or ischemic areas and depicts well acute and chronic intracerebral hemorrhage. Perfusion and diffusion MRI together with MR angiography (MRA) are very helpful for the acute evaluation of patients with ischemic stroke. MRI and MRA are the recommended techniques for screening cerebral aneurysms and for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis and arterial dissection. For the non-invasive study of extracranial vessels, MRA is less portable and more expensive than ultrasonography but it has higher sensitivity and specificity for carotid stenosis. Transcranial Doppler is very useful for monitoring arterial reperfusion after thrombolysis, for the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis and of right-to-left shunts, and for monitoring vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Currently, single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have a more limited role in the evaluation of the acute stroke patient.

Acute ischemic stroke — mechanical thrombectomy vessel imaging includes the following directives: "For patients who otherwise meet criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, noninvasive vessel imaging of the intracranial arteries is recommended during the initial imaging evaluation" (COR I, LOE A), and "For patients with suspected LVO who have not had noninvasive vessel imaging as part of their initial imaging assessment for stroke, noninvasive vessel imaging should then be obtained as quickly as possible (eg, during alteplase infusion if feasible)" (COR I, LOE A). Additional guidance states that "In patients with suspected intracranial LVO and no history of renal impairment, who otherwise meet criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, it is reasonable to proceed with CTA if indicated before obtaining a serum creatinine concentration" (COR IIa, LOE B-NR) and that "In patients who are potential candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, imaging of the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, in addition to the intracranial circulation, may be reasonable to provide useful information on patient eligibility and endovascular procedural planning" (COR IIb, LOE C-EO). As rationale, the meta-analysis cited that "a threshold of ≥ 10 would provide the optimal balance between sensitivity (73%) and specificity (74%)", whereas "a threshold of ≥ 6 would have 87% sensitivity and 52% specificity", and that "The sensitivity of CTA and MRA compared with the gold standard of catheter angiography ranges from 87% to 100%, with CTA having greater accuracy than MRA".

### ACR-ASNR-SNIS-SPR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck [^07f6e878]. ACR/SNIS/SPR/ASNR (2025). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck — overview and comparative features — MRA is a general term that refers to various MRA techniques used for the diagnostic evaluation, quantitative or qualitative severity assessment, and the surveillance of vascular diseases of the brain, head, and neck. Compared with catheter-based angiography, MRA is noninvasive without risk of vascular injury, ischemic neurological complications, or iodinated contrast reactions, and compared with vascular ultrasound, it is less operator dependent, has greater freedom from interference by body habitus, and provides greater 3-D capability. MRA of the head and neck can be performed without any contrast, which is particularly useful in imaging pediatric and pregnant patients, and hemodynamic information can also be obtained from non-contrast MRA; presently, MRA has lower spatial resolution in comparison with computed tomography (CT) or digital subtraction angiography, and the ACR Manual on Contrast Media provides detailed recommendations for the use of contrast agents in at-risk groups.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^5205540f]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Algorithm for evaluating patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke — Ancillary notes specify that basic laboratory tests include complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and fasting or nonfasting lipid profile. Abbreviations are defined (e.g. CT indicates computed tomography; CTA, computed tomography angiogram; ECG, electrocardiogram; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography; US, ultrasound). When a patient has a transient neurological deficit clinically characteristic of transient ischemic attack, the patient should be evaluated in the same manner as a patient who has an ischemic stroke with a corresponding cerebral infarct on imaging. Confirmation of stroke diagnosis may require follow-up head imaging because of poor sensitivity of noncontrast CT for small or hyperacute infarcts. Some conditions associated with stroke and with specific therapies are common whereas others are relatively rare, and the variable yield of testing means that treating physicians need to exercise judgment on the likelihood that a test will alter management in a given clinical situation.

### MR angiography series: neurovascular MR angiography [^4e69e27a]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Neurovascular MR angiography (MRA) is an evolving imaging technique and is crucial for the workup of numerous neurologic disorders. While CT angiography (CTA) provides a more rapid imaging assessment, in select patients it can impart a small risk of contrast material-induced nephrotoxicity or radiation-associated cancers. In addition, MRA offers some advantages over CTA for neurovascular evaluation, including higher temporal resolution and the capability for vessel wall imaging. This module is the third in a series created on behalf of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA), a group of researchers and clinicians who are passionate about the benefits of MRA but understand its challenges.

### Transcranial Doppler sonography for detecting stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries in people with acute ischaemic stroke [^81039632]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An occlusion or stenosis of intracranial large arteries can be detected in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke in about 42% of patients. The approved therapies for acute ischaemic stroke are thrombolysis with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and mechanical thrombectomy; both aim to recanalise an occluded intracranial artery. The reference standard for the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis and occlusion is intra-arterial angiography (IA) and, recently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or contrast-enhanced MRA. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transcranial colour Doppler (TCCD) are useful, rapid, noninvasive tools for the assessment of intracranial large arteries pathology. Due to the current lack of consensus regarding the use of TCD and TCCD in clinical practice, we systematically reviewed the literature for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of these techniques compared with intra-arterial IA, CTA, and MRA for the detection of intracranial stenosis and occlusion in people presenting with symptoms of ischaemic stroke.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of TCD and TCCD for detecting stenosis and occlusion of intracranial large arteries in people with acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We limited our searches from January 1982 onwards as the transcranial Doppler technique was only introduced into clinical practice in the 1980s. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (from 1982 to 2018); Embase (Ovid) (from 1982 to 2018); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (from 1982 to 2018). Moreover, we perused the reference lists of all retrieved articles and of previously published relevant review articles, handsearched relevant conference proceedings, searched relevant websites, and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies comparing TCD or TCCD (index tests) with IA, CTA, MRA, or contrast-enhanced MRA (reference standards) in people with acute ischaemic stroke, where all participants underwent both the index test and the reference standard within 24 hours of symptom onset. We included prospective cohort studies and randomised studies of test comparisons. We also considered retrospective studies eligible for inclusion where the original population sample was recruited prospectively but the results were analysed retrospectively.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts identified by the search strategies, applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed methodological quality (using QUADAS-2), and investigated heterogeneity. We contacted study authors for missing data.

Main Results

A comprehensive search of major relevant electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) from 1982 to 13 March 2018 yielded 13,534 articles, of which nine were deemed eligible for inclusion. The studies included a total of 493 participants. The mean age of included participants was 64.2 years (range 55.8 to 69.9 years). The proportion of men and women was similar across studies. Six studies recruited participants in Europe, one in south America, one in China, and one in Egypt. Risk of bias was high for participant selection but low for flow, timing, index and reference standard. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for TCD and TCCD were 95% (95% CI = 0.83 to 0.99) and 95% (95% CI = 0.90 to 0.98), respectively. Considering a prevalence of stenosis or occlusion of 42% (as reported in the literature), for every 1000 people who receive a TCD or TCCD test, stenosis or occlusion will be missed in 21 people (95% CI = 4 to 71) and 29 (95% CI = 12 to 58) will be wrongly diagnosed as harbouring an intracranial occlusion. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, which was no longer evident when only occlusion of the MCA was considered, or when the analysis was limited to participants investigated within six hours. The performance of either TCD or TCCD in ruling in and ruling out a MCA occlusion was good. Limitations of this review were the small number of identified studies and the lack of data on the use of ultrasound contrast medium.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that TCD or TCCD, administered by professionals with adequate experience and skills, can provide useful diagnostic information for detecting stenosis or occlusion of intracranial vessels in people with acute ischaemic stroke, or guide the request for more invasive vascular neuroimaging, especially where CT or MR-based vascular imaging are not immediately available. More studies are needed to confirm or refute the results of this review in a larger sample of stroke patients, to verify the role of contrast medium and to evaluate the clinical advantage of the use of ultrasound.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^e5982969]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke head and neck imaging — initial imaging and modality selection states that "All patients with suspected acute stroke should receive emergency brain imaging evaluation on first arrival to a hospital before initiating any specific therapy to treat AIS". Systems processes are emphasized: "Systems should be established so that brain imaging studies can be performed as quickly as possible in patients who may be candidates for IV fibrinolysis or mechanical thrombectomy or both", with evidence that "median or mean door-to-imaging times of ≤ 20 minutes can be achieved in a variety of different hospital settings". For hemorrhage exclusion before IV alteplase, both "Noncontrast CT (NCCT) is effective to exclude ICH before IV alteplase administration". and "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) is effective to exclude ICH before IV alteplase administration". are supported. For vascular and perfusion evaluation, "CTA with CTP or MR angiography (MRA) with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) with or without MR perfusion is recommended for certain patients", and this imaging "is useful for selecting candidates for mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours after last known well". Additional diagnostic notes include that "MRI was as accurate as NCCT in detecting hyperacute intracranial hemorrhage in patients presenting within 6 hours of onset when gradient echo sequences were used", and in wake-up or unclear-onset presentations, "MRI to identify diffusion-positive fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)–negative lesions can be useful for selecting those who can benefit from IV alteplase administration within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom recognition".

### Prevalence of systematic atherosclerosis burdens and overlapping stroke etiologies… [^6206f3e1]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

A, Prevalences of intracranial stenosis of 50% or greater or occlusion are shown according to the severity of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. The P value for the trend was. 002 and was calculated including the severity as the ordinal variable. B, Prevalences of intracranial stenosis of 50% or greater or occlusion are shown according to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The P value for the trend was. 004 and was calculated including the severity as the ordinal variable. Main Outcomes and Measures Significant ICAD was defined as having 50% or greater stenosis/occlusion by contrast-enhanced/time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, and/or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Systemic vascular investigations on atherosclerotic disease were performed with ultrasonography in carotid arteries, aorta and femoral arteries, and by angiography in coronary arteries.

Intracranial arteries were examined by contrast-enhanced/time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, and/or transcranial Doppler ultrasound. For angiography, the narrowest diameter of each stenosed vessel was measured and divided by the diameter of the normal vessel proximal to the lesion or distal to the lesion if the proximal artery was diseased. 12 Transcranial Doppler evaluations were made by senior ultrasonographers according to previously published criteria. 13 Significant ICAD was defined as a 50% or greater stenosis or occlusion. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease was considered symptomatic if the stenosis was ipsilateral to the index stroke and asymptomatic if not. Extracranial carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated by ultrasonography.

Results were categorized into absence of plaques, plaques with or without stenosis of any degree, and luminal stenosis at the most stenosed segment of 1% to 49%, 50% to 69%, or 70% to 100%. Coronary atherosclerosis was evaluated by catheter angiography in patients with no known history of coronary events. We performed cardiac catheterization for research purposes after obtaining consent from every participant. Results were categorized into absence of plaques, plaques with or without stenosis of any degree, and stenosis of 1% to 49%, 50% to 69%, or 70% to 100%.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^3aee06ae]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is abnormal perception of sound and has many subtypes. Clinical evaluation, audiometry, and otoscopy should be performed before ordering any imaging, as the choice of imaging will depend on various factors. Type of tinnitus (pulsatile or nonpulsatile) and otoscopy findings of a vascular retrotympanic lesion are key determinants to guide the choice of imaging studies. High-resolution CT temporal bone is an excellent tool to detect glomus tumors, abnormal course of vessels, and some other abnormalities when a vascular retrotympanic lesion is seen on otoscopy. CTA or a combination of MR and MRA/MRV are used to evaluate arterial or venous abnormalities like dural arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous malformation, carotid stenosis, dural sinus stenosis, and bony abnormalities like sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities in cases of pulsatile tinnitus without a vascular retrotympanic lesion. MR of the brain is excellent in detecting mass lesions such as vestibular schwannomas in cases of unilateral nonpulsatile tinnitus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR-NASCI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [^e55f3fce]. SPR/NASCI/ACR (2025). High credibility.

Body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) — specifications of the examination note that the written or electronic request for Body MRA should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination and allow for the proper performance and interpretation of the examination, and documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes 1) signs and symptoms and/or 2) relevant history (including known diagnoses). The request for the examination must be originated by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider, and the accompanying clinical information should be provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider familiar with the patient's clinical problem or question and consistent with the state scope of practice requirements. The supervising physician must have adequate understanding of the indications, risks, and benefits of the examination as well as the alternative imaging procedures, must be familiar with potential hazards associated with MRI, including potential adverse reactions to contrast media, and should be familiar with relevant ancillary studies that the patient may have already undergone. The physician performing MRI interpretation must have a clear understanding and knowledge of the anatomy and pathophysiology relevant to the MRI examination.

### Can intracranial time-of-flight-MR angiography predict extracranial carotid artery stenosis? [^c3cb5ae5]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses constitute common and relevant causes of ischemic stroke. Patients with middle- or high-grade stenosis (> 50%) are more likely to experience worse functional outcome and early stroke recurrence than patients with no or low-grade (< 50%) stenosis. Especially in patients with high-grade (70–99%) extracranial ICA stenosis (ICAS), timely intervention can prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Therefore, timely identification of ipsilateral symptomatic ICAS is of clinical relevance.

In clinical practice, Doppler ultrasound (US) is a commonly accepted and easily accessible method in diagnosing extracranial ICAS. However, it has its drawbacks as well, that are investigator and experience dependency. In most comprehensive stroke centers, CT angiography (CTA) is still the primary examination in the emergency setting in patients with suspected acute stroke because of its broad and fast availability. MRI is also increasingly used in clinical practice because of the positive proof of the infarct core using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Standard stroke MRI protocols do not routinely include extracranial contrast-agent-based MR angiography (MRA), mainly to reduce investigation time, but also due to the potential risk for allergic reactions. Another risk, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis seems to occur less frequently with novel contrast agents. Time-of-flight (TOF) MRA has limitations in accuracy compared to contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) and it generally tends to overestimate the degree of the stenosis.

Based on the principle of flow-related signal changes in TOF-MRA, our assumption was that a proximal extracranial ICAS results in a lower ipsilateral intracranial signal intensity (SI) in TOF-MRA. We hypothesized that SIs of the intracranial ICA differ in patients with extracranial ICAS compared to healthy controls.

### The potential role of diffusion weighted imaging in the diagnosis of early carotid and vertebral artery dissection [^b8d2d8e1]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic performance of DWI

The results of all patients regarding IMH length on DWI, confirmatory image modality (MRA, CTA, DSA), vessel involvement (stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm), and length of the CAD manifestation are presented for each individual patient in Table 1. A signal hyperintensity on DWI suggestive of CAD was detected in 28 of the 30 dissected vessels resulting in a sensitivity of 93%. There were no DWI hyperintensities detectable in the control group patients resulting in a specificity of 100%.

Regarding the time interval between symptom onset and MRI, we subdivided the CAD cases into four different groups (Table 2). In the group presenting within 24 h after symptom onset, we detected a hyperintense signal intensity in the affected vessel in 10 of 12 cases resulting in a sensitivity of 83%. In all patients of the groups presenting to the MRI between 24–48 h, 48–72 h, and 72 h–42 days after symptom onset, we identified a hyperintense signal intensity in the affected vessel (100% sensitivity). The high signal intensity on the DWI was even present in one participant within the first 1.5 h (Table 1, case number 11, Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4).

Fig. 4
A case with DSA, CTA, MRA and DWI that shows that CTA and MRA were misleading and that DWI matched DSA. a A coronal CTA shows a contrast agent stop immediately distal the ICA origin that supposes a long distance occlusion. b A coronal TOF reconstruction shows a long distance absent flow signal in the right ICA, which supposes also a long distance occlusion. c A coronal DWI in contrary to the previous modalities shows a short distance hyperintensity in the ICA wall at the skull base. d A coronal DSA shows a contrast agent stop immediately distal the ICA origin, while the catheter tip was still located in the common carotid artery (CCA). e A coronal DSA shows contrast agent more distal and in a longer segment of the ICA after the catheter tip was placed in the ICA origin. f A coronal DSA after replacing the catheter and moving it carefully until there was a resistance against forward catheter pushing that shows now the real dissected segment of the ICA, which matches the length of DWI hyperintensity

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^49b9e334]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Headache neuroimaging modalities and radiation exposure — selection and technology considerations state that, according to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for Headache, CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head remains the best choice for headache imaging when imaging is necessary, and some patients need cerebrovascular imaging such as CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The document notes rapid CT evolution to multi-slice scanners with up to 320 detectors and specifies that CT scans expose the patient to approximately 2 mSv compared with one chest radiograph at 0.02 mSv.

### ACR-ASNR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck [^fbf3db23]. ACR/SPR/ASNR (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck CTA — acquisition parameters and anatomic coverage specify section thickness and region extents. The acquisition should be performed with a section thickness of 1.5 mm or less and reconstructed with overlapping sections. For indications such as intracranial aneurysms, vasospasm, and cerebral venous thrombosis, imaging may include only the head, whereas neck CTA should at least cover the aortic arch through the skull base. For stroke imaging, coverage should extend through the circle of Willis and may be extended up to the cranial vertex; in pediatrics, anatomic coverage should be strictly limited to vascular segments of interest. Automated tube voltage selection can be employed with tube current modulation when available.

### CT neuroangiography: a glance at the common pitfalls and their prevention [^fc2f1037]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The author's objective was to address several pitfalls and missteps of CT angiography (CTA) with pictorial examples and ways to overcome potential misinterpretations. CTA is increasingly used for the noninvasive evaluation of the carotid and intracranial vessels. Ease of data acquisition may belie the complexity of interpreting each individual vessel and understanding myriad postprocessing techniques, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion

Diagnostic yield and accuracy of CT angiography are enhanced by good data acquisition and by understanding and fully exploiting postprocessing techniques.
