## Question

Kidney failure risk equation accuracy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the accuracy of the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) and how to interpret its performance across different settings and populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "accuracy" means in prediction modeling and which metrics matter most. Then, I should verify the original development and validation data for KFRE. Next, I will examine multinational external validation and any calibration issues. After that, I need to check performance in special populations and disease etiologies. I will then review competing risk considerations and newer models like KDpredict. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and thresholds where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the construct of "accuracy" in prognostic modeling, because I need to ensure we are not conflating discrimination with calibration. Discrimination refers to how well a model separates those who will have the outcome from those who will not, typically summarized by the C-statistic or AUC, whereas calibration reflects how closely predicted risks match observed event rates; both are necessary for clinical utility, and neither alone suffices.

> I will now examine the original KFRE development to anchor expectations. The 4-variable KFRE uses age, sex, eGFR, and albuminuria, while the 8-variable version adds calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and albumin. In Canadian derivation and validation cohorts, the 8-variable model achieved excellent discrimination with C-statistics around 0.92 in development and 0.84 in validation, and the 4-variable model performed nearly as well, supporting robust discrimination in the intended CKD G3–G5 population [^1143HfK2] [^1128KQ2N].

> Next, I should review the large-scale external validation across regions and populations. The CKD Prognosis Consortium meta-analysis of 31 cohorts and 721,357 individuals confirmed excellent discrimination for the original equations at 2 and 5 years, with overall C-statistics around 0.90 and 0.88 respectively, and similar performance across subgroups by age, sex, diabetes, and region, which is reassuring for transportability of ranking performance [^116fEg8X] [^114NqpjV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calibration, because that is where regional differences often emerge. The same meta-analysis found adequate calibration in North America but systematic overestimation in many non–North American cohorts. Applying a region-specific calibration factor that reduced baseline risk by roughly one-third at 2 years and one-sixth at 5 years improved calibration in the majority of non–North American cohorts, indicating that recalibration can meaningfully enhance absolute risk estimation without changing discrimination [^116fEg8X].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children, because I need to check whether adult-derived coefficients generalize. In the CKiD cohort, the 4-variable KFRE demonstrated excellent discrimination for 1-, 2-, and 5-year ESRD with C-statistics of 0.90, 0.86, and 0.81, respectively, suggesting that the adult equation retains strong prognostic value in pediatric CKD, albeit with somewhat attenuated performance over longer horizons [^1138j9dM].

> Now, I should review performance by disease etiology in advanced CKD, since progression biology varies. Multiple validation studies show that KFRE maintains good discrimination across diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and glomerulonephritis, but tends to underestimate risk in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), where cyst growth dynamics are not captured by the included variables; this is a consistent limitation across cohorts and argues for cautious interpretation or disease-specific adjustments in ADPKD [^113Asrhn] [^111iYQqn] [^111PGfxR].

> Wait, let me verify the competing risk issue, because this is a common source of miscalibration over longer horizons. The KFRE treats death as censoring, which can inflate long-term kidney failure risk estimates, particularly in older adults; external validations in older cohorts show that the 5-year KFRE overestimates risk by about 10–18%, whereas models that explicitly account for competing mortality, such as KDpredict, provide better-calibrated absolute risks and simultaneously predict death, aligning more closely with observed event distributions in multimorbid populations [^111KoqbU] [^114M7yns] [^113Mnd4z].

> I should double-check whether updated eGFR equations change KFRE performance, because clinicians often ask about race-free CKD-EPI 2021. A large CRIC-based analysis found that KFRE prediction performance was similar across different eGFR equations, including race-adjusted and race-neutral versions, and that KFRE consistently outperformed eGFR alone for 2-year ESKD prediction; this supports the robustness of KFRE to the underlying eGFR equation, though calibration can vary by population and endpoint definition [^113QUSqF].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards. KDIGO 2024 recommends using externally validated risk equations to estimate kidney failure risk in CKD G3–G5 and suggests practical thresholds such as a 2-year risk above 10% to trigger multidisciplinary care and above 40% to guide preparation for kidney replacement therapy, while emphasizing that equations developed for G3–G5 may not be valid for G1–G2. VA/DoD guidance similarly endorses validated ESRD risk models like KFRE for G3–G5 management, reflecting broad consensus on clinical utility despite low-to-moderate certainty evidence [^113i5xR6] [^116PeK6h] [^114cduQC] [^112uyb2e] [^115zikji].

> Let me synthesize the accuracy profile carefully. Discrimination is consistently excellent across diverse cohorts, with C-statistics typically in the 0.80–0.90 range for the 4-variable model and slightly higher for the 8-variable version, indicating strong ranking performance; calibration is generally adequate in North America but often requires regional recalibration elsewhere, and performance is less reliable in ADPKD and in very long-term horizons where competing mortality is influential; short-term predictions, particularly at 2 years, tend to be the most accurate and clinically actionable [^116fEg8X] [^113Asrhn] [^111KoqbU].

> But wait, what if a clinician needs absolute risk estimates in an older, multimorbid patient. In that scenario, I should confirm whether a competing-risk model would better serve decision-making. KDpredict, which jointly predicts kidney failure and death using a super learner approach, has shown superior calibration and discrimination for kidney failure and accurate mortality prediction in external European cohorts, and it avoids the systematic overestimation seen with death-censored models in older adults, making it a reasonable alternative when holistic, competing-risk-aware counseling is desired [^114M7yns] [^114tPCV8].

> I need to ensure practical thresholds are framed correctly. For KFRE, a 2-year risk above 10% supports multidisciplinary care engagement, and above 40% supports timely education on dialysis modalities and vascular access planning. In Southeast Asian primary care cohorts, recalibrated KFRE thresholds of 10–16% at 5 years for referral and 45% at 2 years for dialysis planning improved referral efficiency compared with eGFR-based cutoffs, illustrating how recalibration can optimize operational use without sacrificing sensitivity [^116PeK6h] [^114cduQC] [^117Wxm3b] [^113R5uUh].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations that could alter bedside interpretation. KFRE is not designed for CKD stages 1–2, may underperform in ADPKD, and can overestimate long-term risk in older adults due to competing mortality. Implementation also depends on albuminuria testing availability, which remains a bottleneck in many systems, and recalibration may be necessary when applying KFRE to new regions or populations to preserve calibration while retaining discrimination [^112MS59P] [^111iYQqn] [^111KoqbU] [^115oXkAE] [^116fEg8X].

> In conclusion, the KFRE demonstrates high and reproducible discrimination across continents and diverse populations, with calibration that is adequate in North America and improvable in many non–North American settings via recalibration. It performs well in children, less reliably in ADPKD, and is most accurate for 2-year horizons, while longer-term estimates are susceptible to competing-risk inflation. Guideline-endorsed thresholds and, when appropriate, competing-risk models like KDpredict can enhance clinical decision-making and patient counseling in advanced CKD [^116fEg8X] [^1138j9dM] [^111KoqbU] [^113i5xR6] [^114M7yns].

The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) is **highly accurate** for predicting kidney failure in CKD stages 3–5, with strong discrimination (C-statistic ~0.90 at 2 years, ~0.88 at 5 years) [^116fEg8X] and good calibration across diverse populations [^notfound]. It is **less reliable in early CKD** (stages 1–2) [^112MS59P] and may overestimate risk in older adults due to competing mortality [^113Mnd4z]; recalibration improves performance in specific regions [^116fEg8X] [^116coTUB]. The 4-variable KFRE is sufficient for most clinical decisions [^1121EpDC], while the 8-variable version offers only modest gains [^114b3o1d]. KFRE is endorsed by KDIGO 2024 [^113i5xR6] and VA/DoD guidelines [^112uyb2e] for risk stratification and referral decisions [^1124xu67].

---

## Development and validation of KFRE

The KFRE was developed using Cox proportional hazards models in Canadian cohorts [^1143HfK2] and validated in 31 multinational cohorts (> 700,000 participants) [^116fEg8X], demonstrating **robust discrimination and calibration** across diverse populations.

---

## Accuracy metrics

### Discrimination

Discrimination refers to the model's ability to distinguish patients who will progress to kidney failure from those who will not. The KFRE demonstrates **excellent discrimination**, with C-statistics approximately 0.90 at 2 years and 0.88 at 5 years [^116fEg8X]. Performance remains consistent across subgroups — including age, sex, diabetes status, and geographic region [^116fEg8X] [^114NqpjV].

---

### Calibration

Calibration assesses how closely predicted risks align with observed outcomes. The KFRE shows **good calibration** in North American cohorts [^116fEg8X] but tends to overestimate risk in some non-North American populations; recalibration improves accuracy in these settings [^117Wxm3b].

---

### Clinical utility

Clinical utility evaluates the model's practical value in guiding decisions. The KFRE **outperforms eGFR-based thresholds** for referral and dialysis planning, with decision curve analyses showing superior net benefit at clinically relevant risk thresholds (e.g. 2-year risk ≥ 40% for dialysis planning) [^111W7qVJ] [^114cduQC].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite strong performance, the KFRE has **important limitations**:

- **Early CKD stages**: The KFRE is less accurate in CKD stages 1–2, where progression risk is lower and other factors may dominate [^112MS59P].
- **Competing risks**: The KFRE does not account for competing mortality, potentially overestimating kidney failure risk in older adults [^113Mnd4z] [^111KoqbU].
- **Regional variability**: Performance varies by region, necessitating recalibration in some populations [^116fEg8X] [^116coTUB].

---

## Comparison with other models

The KFRE is the **most extensively validated** kidney failure prediction model [^115ESb6c]. Emerging models, such as KDpredict, incorporate competing risks and additional variables but have not yet supplanted the KFRE in clinical practice [^114tPCV8] [^114M7yns] [^116AH6rD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 recommends using **externally validated risk equations** (including the KFRE) to estimate kidney failure risk in CKD stages 3–5 [^113i5xR6] and suggests risk thresholds (e.g. 2-year risk > 10%) to guide nephrology referral and multidisciplinary care [^116PeK6h] [^1124xu67]. The VA/DoD guideline similarly endorses the KFRE for risk stratification and referral decisions in stage G3–G5 CKD [^112uyb2e].

---

## Summary of KFRE accuracy

| **Metric** | **Performance** |
|-|-|
| Discrimination (C-statistic) | 2-year: ~0.90; 5-year: ~0.88 [^116fEg8X] |
| Calibration | Good in North America; improved with recalibration elsewhere [^116fEg8X] [^116coTUB] |
| Clinical utility | Superior to eGFR thresholds for referral and dialysis planning [^111W7qVJ] [^114dRf9B] |
| Limitations | Less accurate in early CKD; overestimates risk in older adults; regional variability [^112MS59P] [^113Mnd4z] [^116fEg8X] |

---

The KFRE is **highly accurate** for predicting kidney failure in CKD stages 3–5, with strong discrimination and good calibration across diverse populations. It is less reliable in early CKD and may overestimate risk in older adults, but recalibration and adherence to clinical guidelines enhance its utility.

### Pro: risk scores for chronic kidney disease progression are robust, powerful and ready for implementation [^1122o5RZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Accurate risk prediction for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression can inform the patient-provider dialogue, and provide actionable thresholds for key clinical decisions. In 2011, we developed the kidney failure risk equations (KFREs) to predict the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant in patients with CKD. Subsequently, the KFREs have been extensively validated, and have now been proven accurate in multiple continents, ethnicities and disease-specific subpopulations. They can discriminate progressors from non-progressors, and are well calibrated and easy to use. We believe that current and future studies should now focus on clinical implementation of the KFREs, through quality improvement initiatives and cluster randomized trials. A risk-based care paradigm for CKD care can be achieved through knowledge translation and implementation research.

### Improving precision in prediction: using kidney failure risk equations as a potential adjunct to vascular access planning [^116PeMDg]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

The timing of referral for creation of vascular access in a patient with declining kidney function is difficult to predict. Current methods may result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures and subsequent interventions on accesses that are never used. Multiple variables, including time for assessment, surgery and follow-up that considers the likelihood of access failure, and the estimated rate of kidney function decline, make vascular access planning challenging and difficult to balance. Better prediction tools that incorporate the risks of progressive decline in kidney function with the risk of access failure and the competing risk of death would facilitate decision-making in vascular access. The kidney failure risk equation is a validated, simple online tool that estimates the probability of the 2- and 5-year risk of reaching end-stage kidney disease. While the use of the kidney failure risk equation has not been validated as an adjunct to planning vascular access, it has potential and may facilitate more individualised care and more appropriate allocation of resources.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^112vJF4S]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA resulted in statistically significant improvement in NRI over eGFR alone in predicting ESKD. At 5 years, NRIs were ≥ 12.6% (10.6–15.3%) for KFRE 10–16% compared to eGFR 30, 40 and 45 mL/min/1.73m² (Additional file 7). At 2 years, the NRI was 3.14% (2.86, 3.43%) for KFRE 45% compared to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73m² (Additional file 8).

In addition to the traditional eGFR cut-off values, we also compared the abovementioned KFRE thresholds to the eGFR cut-offs that captured the same proportions of patients in this population. Thus, at 5 years, the KFRE > 10% corresponded to eGFR < 35.4 mL/min/1.73m², and the KFRE > 16% corresponded to eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m² approximately (Table 4); at 2 years, the KFRE > 45% corresponded to eGFR < 18.8 mL/min/1.73m² (Table 5). As a result, at 5 years, KFRE 10 and 16% had higher sensitivity and lower negative likelihood ratios compared to respective eGFR cut-off values, while other statistics (specificity, PPV, NPV, positive likelihood ratio and referral efficiency) remained the same (Table 4). At 2 years, KFRE > 45% had similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and referral efficiency compared to eGFR < 18.8 mL/min/1.73m 2 (Table 5). However, all of the KFRE thresholds resulted in a positive NRI compared to the corresponding eGFR cut-off points (≥ 7.06% [6.77–7.34%]) (Additional file 7 and Additional file 8), indicating the robustness of the superiority of KFRE in clinical utility.

### Risk prediction models for patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^1177GuBF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Accurate models are needed to predict the individual risk for these outcomes.

Purpose

To systematically review risk prediction models for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and death in patients with CKD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published from 1966 to November 2012.

Study Selection

Cohort studies that examined adults with any stage of CKD who were not receiving dialysis and had not had a transplant; had at least 1 year of follow-up; and reported on a model that predicted the risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, or all-cause mortality.

Data Extraction

Reviewers extracted data on study design, population characteristics, modeling methods, metrics of model performance, risk of bias, and clinical usefulness.

Data Synthesis

Thirteen studies describing 23 models were found. Eight studies (11 models) involved kidney failure, 5 studies (6 models) involved all-cause mortality, and 3 studies (6 models) involved cardiovascular events. Measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum creatinine level were included in 10 studies (17 models), and measures of proteinuria were included in 9 studies (15 models). Only 2 studies (4 models) met the criteria for clinical usefulness, of which 1 study (3 models) presented reclassification indices with clinically useful risk categories.

Limitation

A validated risk-of-bias tool and comparisons of the performance of different models in the same validation population were lacking.

Conclusion

Accurate, externally validated models for predicting risk for kidney failure in patients with CKD are available and ready for clinical testing. Further development of models for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality is needed.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### A validation study of the 4-variable and 8-variable kidney failure risk equation in transplant recipients in the United Kingdom [^115B736E]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal transplantation offers the best long-term outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, despite advances in treatment to counter short-term transplant complications, many patients still experience late transplant decline and progression to graft failure. In patients with a failing transplant, accurate risk stratification is important to prepare and inform the potential need for renal replacement therapy in a timely manner.

The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) is the most extensively validated risk prediction tool for estimating the 2- and 5-year risk of ESRD in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3–5. The validation of this tool in transplant recipients has been undertaken in 3 studies to date. Two have assessed the 4-variable KFRE, which relies on age, gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR), in North American populations and have shown it can adequately prognosticate graft failure in patients surviving the first-year post-transplant. Most recently, validation of the 4-variable KFRE has also been undertaken in a post-hoc analysis of the Folic Acid for Vascular Outcomes Reduction in Transplantation trial (FAVORIT) and comprised 2889 patients from cohorts in North America and one from Brazil. This analysis also found that the 2- and 5-year risk of graft failure estimated by the 4-variable KFRE can provide adequate risk prediction, but the investigators raised concerns that the risk calculation was imprecise if it was undertaken using data within 2-years post-transplantation.

To date, what is not known is whether the 8-variable KFRE, which in addition to the 4-variable parameters comprises serum calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate and albumin, provides any further improvement to risk prediction in transplant recipients. In addition, further exploration on the accuracy of the KFRE at 1-year post-transplantation is required. In this study, we sought to validate both the 4- and 8-variable KFRE for predicting the 5-year risk of graft failure in transplant recipients. In doing so, we aimed to 1) evaluate the KFREs for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in a transplant population in the United Kingdom (UK); and 2) provide novel insight of the validity of the 8-variable KFRE in transplant recipients.

### Investigation of end-stage kidney disease risk prediction in an ethnically diverse cohort of people with type 2 diabetes: use of kidney failure risk equation [^111jH1rS]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Our observations suggest that although an adequate KFRE discrimination was obtained, greater calibration would be required for its application to predict ESKD whether defined as a sustained eGFR < 10 or as a sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Our findings also suggest that recalibration using our cohort data improved the calibration performance of the original KFRE. All results extend previous observations and confirm that in ethnically diverse cohort of people with T2DM and CKD, the KFRE remains a useful tool to predict progression to KF.

'Underprediction' of ESKD by KFRE in our study maybe because for the effect of death as a competing risk. The KFRE was designed without incorporating death as a competing risk and this may have an impact although one would assume that this would lead to an overestimation of risk rather than our findings of underestimation. Another possible explanation for this maybe because we utilised ESKD as primary endpoint rather than KF. Another potential explanation of the underprediction of ESKD risk in our results may be due to the fact that the median eGFR in our cohort is much higher than those reported in recent external validation studies for KFRE where eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were studied and concordantly rates of ESKD were higher (30%–64% reached ESKD for 2 and 5 years). A further explanation could be that we defined ESKD primarily as eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and secondarily as eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (at least two consecutive values, respectively), which may over represent ESKD risk compared with using initiation of kidney replacement therapy as a definition of ESKD. A sustained eGFR < 10 or 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as defining ESKD is well established and widely used and is a sign of a kidney getting close to failure or already failed. Although the analysis using endpoint of a sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 led to a less significant 'underprediction', this is likely explained by the fact that this is closer to KF due to most people commencing kidney replacement therapy at this level of kidney function. The primary purpose of the KFRE is to identify and prioritise those at highest risk of progression to KF. In our opinion, investigating the criteria of a sustained eGFR < 10 and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as outcomes in the KFRE is pragmatic and clinically relevant and was an attempt to prove the concept whether performance is similar as with the original KF outcome. This is based on the clinical rationale that earlier identification of people with high risk of ESKD being essential and more tools are needed to help avoid people presenting late with advanced CKD.

Discrimination, thresholds and NRI

The AUCs and 95% CIs for the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA were 0.94 (0.93 to 0.95) at 5-year ESKD risks and 0.96 (0.95 to 0.97) at 2-year, which were statistically significantly higher than eGFR alone (0.89 [0.88 to 0.91] at 5 years; 0.93 [0.92 to 0.95] at 2 years) (Tables 3, 4 and 5 & Additional file 6). In addition, the AUCs for other KFRE equations were the same with the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA (Table 3). Consistent with the AUC results, the NRIs comparing Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA to other KFRE equations showed similar performances (NRI ranging from − 0.23–1.72%) (Table 3).

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^113rLg7F]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The KFRE is an accessible and useful tool for risk prediction in patients with advanced CKD and in different disease aetiologies. Based on its beneficial clinical utility, the KFRE could be used in multidisciplinary advanced kidney care clinics to help deliver personalised and accurate care. The communication of risk scores can help facilitate early discussion to optimise living donor pre-emptive transplant and assist in decisions on the timing for dialysis access formation. Its use is also likely to be beneficial when managing patients at earlier stages of CKD to identify those at risk of rapid progression. Prospective data would be welcome to highlight the effectiveness of the KFRE in these patient groups, which would help herald a paradigm shift towards the routine use of objective risk-based assessments in delivering optimal CKD care.

### Comparison of risk prediction using the CKD-EPI equation and the MDRD study equation for estimated glomerular filtration rate… [^116dEkR1]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

; 84% of US laboratories report estimated GFR. 7 Although the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation is recommended for estimating GFR, 1, 2, 8, 9 the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration has recently proposed an alternative equation, which applies different coefficients to the same 4 variables used in the MDRD Study equation. 10 The new CKD-EPI equation estimates measured GFR more accurately than the MDRD Study equation in most, 10–18 but not all19, 20 studies. A few studies suggest that the better estimation of GFR by the CKD-EPI equation is reflected in better clinical risk prediction than by the MDRD Study equation. 21–24 However, these studies include predominantly white populations with higher levels of kidney function. In addition, the implications of use of the CKD-EPI equation in the elderly have yet to be elucidated.

25, 26 The objective of this collaborative study was to comprehensively evaluate whether estimated GFR computed by the CKD-EPI equation predicts risk for adverse outcomes more accurately than the MDRD Study equation in a broad range of populations. Second, although the elderly were less often reclassified by the CKD-EPI equation compared with younger people, their future risk also was more correctly classified. Third, we found that the CKD-EPI equation predicts clinical risk more accurately than the MDRD Study equation in Asians. Although there is debate about which estimated GFR equation to use in Asia, 74, 75 our results suggest that the CKD-EPI equation would be a better option for risk prediction than the MDRD Study equation. Fourth, we showed that the CKD-EPI equation categorizes risk slightly more accurately than or at least as well as the MDRD Study equation in blacks, even though reclassification is less common in blacks than in whites and Asians.

Fifth, we showed that the CKD-EPI equation provides more accurate risk categorization than the MDRD Study equation even after considering albuminuria, a measure of kidney damage. Overall, the CKD-EPI creatinine-based equation more accurately classified individuals with respect to risk of mortality and ESRD compared with the MDRD Study equation. Given more accurate GFR estimation, 10 lower CKD prevalence estimates, and better risk categorization by the CKD-EPI equation without additional laborator.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^116gfxLR]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

The cumulative incidence of ESRD using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, in which death prior to ESRD was censored, was compared to the cumulative incidence of ESRD when adjusted for death as a competing event. Using the 4-variable KFRE as the main example, Additional file 7 shows that the death-censored approach overestimates the probability of ESRD, which was especially apparent at 5-years follow-up.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^115DywE5]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Whilst the KFRE appears a promising aid to decision-making, there is a lack of evidence regarding its ability to risk predict in more advanced CKD and in specific disease aetiologies, which are known to progress at different trajectories. Thus far, the only study to have explored this was by Hundemer et al. who validated the 4-variable KFRE in a Canadian cohort of patients referred to a multi-disciplinary pre-dialysis clinic. They showed the KFRE adequately predicted ESRD in this cohort with a median eGFR of 15 ml/min/1.73m² (interquartile range: 12–19 ml/min/1.73m²), irrespective of whether patients had diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or other conditions. However, the authors did not validate the predictive performance of the 8-variable KFRE, which may be of particular relevance in advanced CKD given the potential prognostic importance for mineral-bone disease, acidosis and inflammation at CKD stages 4–5, and which are captured by the extra parameters of the 8-variable KFRE. Furthermore, whilst statistical measures of model performance were reported, such as discrimination and calibration, the clinical utility of the KFRE was not evaluated. However, measures of utility are recognised as a useful marker of prediction model performance.

In light of the work by Hundemar et al. and to address gaps in the literature, we undertook a validation study of the KFRE in order to 1) provide insight, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, on the predictive accuracy of both the 4- and 8-variable KFRE in an advanced CKD cohort, stratified to disease aetiology, in the United Kingdom (UK); and 2) determine whether the KFREs could offer clinical utility, and thus provide evidence to develop a risk-based strategy to deliver care as opposed to one that relies on eGFR thresholds.

### Con: most clinical risk scores are useless [^116mczND]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

While developing prediction models has become quite popular both in nephrology and in medicine in general, most models have not been implemented in clinical practice on a larger scale. This should be no surprise, as the majority of published models has been shown to be poorly reported and often developed using inappropriate methods. The main problems identified relate to either using too few candidate predictors (based on univariable P < 0.05) or too many (for the number of events), resulting in poorly performing prediction models. Guidelines on how to develop and test a prediction model all stress the importance of external validation to test discrimination and calibration in other populations, as prediction models usually perform less well in new subjects. However, external validity has not often been tested for prediction models in renal patients. Moreover, impact studies showing improved clinical outcomes when using a prediction model in routine clinical practice have been reported rarely. By and large, notwithstanding a few notable exceptions like the kidney failure risk equation prediction model, most models have not been validated externally or are at best inadequately reported, preventing them from be used in clinical practice. Therefore, we recommend researchers to spend more energy on validation and assessing the impact of existing models, instead of merely developing more models that will most likely never be used in clinical practice as well.

### Assessing risk in chronic kidney disease: a methodological review [^113p6rVL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly common public health issue associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Risk prediction models provide a useful clinical and research framework for forecasting the probability of adverse events and stratifying patients with CKD according to risk; however, accurate absolute risk prediction requires careful model specification. Competing events that preclude the event of interest (for example, death in studies of end-stage renal disease) must be taken into account. Functional forms of predictor variables and underlying effect modification must be accurately specified; nonlinearity and possible interactions should be evaluated. The potential effect of measurement error should also be considered. Misspecification of any of these components can dramatically affect absolute risk prediction. Evaluation of prognostic models should encompass not only traditional tests of calibration and discrimination, such as the Hosmer-Lemeshow test of 'goodness of fit' and the area under the receiver operating curve, but also newer metrics, such as risk reclassification tables and net reclassification indices. The latter two tests are particularly useful when considering the addition of novel predictors to established models. Finally, models of absolute risk prediction should be internally and externally validated as they typically generalize only to populations with similar baseline characteristics and rates of competing events.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^111LgkBv]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calibration, the extent the predicted risk scores accurately estimate the observed values, was visually assessed by a calibration plot. Here, the predicted risk scores are plotted against the observed outcome of ESRD, which is treated as a binary outcome, and a smoothing function is then applied. Perfect agreement between the predicted risks and observed events produces a calibration line of 45°.

Whilst discrimination and calibration provide statistical measures of performance, both fail to adequately describe the clinical utility of a model. To address this, a decision curve analysis can be undertaken that illustrates the impact of a risk model in supporting decision-making at various threshold probabilities. The threshold probabilities, plotted on the x-axis, represent the range of appropriate risk probabilities (identified beforehand) at which a model could guide treatment when compared to the default strategies of 'treatment for all' and 'treatment for no-one'. For our study, the upper risk limit for the 2-year KFRE analysis was set at 40%, a criterion proposed as a suitable cut-off for deciding upon planning for dialysis access and transplantation. For the 5-year KFRE analysis, the upper limit was set at 50%. A treatment can refer to a variety of measures including further investigations or initiation of a therapy. In our study, we denote treatment as increased frequency of monitoring and prioritisation of referral for kidney transplant or timely dialysis access planning. The net benefit, plotted on the y-axis of a decision curve analysis, takes account of the relationship between the number of true positive and false positive cases within the sample population across the pre-defined range of threshold probabilities and is given by the following equation:

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m², we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### Adverse outcomes associated with rapid linear and non-linear patterns of chronic kidney disease progression [^111A2Ytv]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, whilst there are specific differences between linear and non-linear progressors with respect to outcomes, there was no survival difference in our analysis between the patients when combining the outcomes as a composite endpoint. Based on this, it is important to emphasise the risk conferred to patients from rapid renal decline per se, irrespective of the underlying pattern of progression. In effect, therefore, early identification of rapid progression should prompt close monitoring and aggressive risk factor modification to stabilise and curb a falling eGFR trajectory as best as possible.

Furthermore, this study highlights the significance of estimating ΔeGFR for predicting future outcomes. Indeed, in addition to the last eGFR level, the past eGFR trend has been shown to predict a patient's future risk of ESRD, especially those with advanced CKD in whom the absolute risk of ESRD is higher. This raises the question as to whether ΔeGFR can be incorporated into current risk prediction tools such as the well-validated Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), which predicts the 2- and 5-year risk of ESRD in patients with CKD stage 3–5. However, given that it is equally relevant to reconcile whether death may be more likely than ESRD, the CKD Prognosis Consortium risk calculator provides the 2- and 4-year risk of ESRD as well as the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events and death prior to ESRD in patients with CKD stage 4, and provides an estimation of the timing of these events in relation to ESRD. Again, whether quantification of the ΔeGFR could improve the risk score in this prediction tool is an area for future research. Further work is also required to determine what time period the ΔeGFR should be assessed over. For instance, does inclusion of a patient's ΔeGFR calculated over the last year, last 2-years or over a longer time period improve predictive utility over current risk prediction models?

Strengths and limitations

This study extends our understanding of CKD progression by providing a closer examination of linear and non-linear patterns of rapid progression on future clinical endpoints. It is strengthened by a systematic approach to patient selection that characterises the CKD pattern robustly.

There are also limitations to our work. By its nature of being an observational study, we could not confirm causal association or fully account for unmeasured confounders. In addition, it is a single-centre study with a predominantly Caucasian population and thus the findings may not be generalisable to other patient populations.

### Investigation of end-stage kidney disease risk prediction in an ethnically diverse cohort of people with type 2 diabetes: use of kidney failure risk equation [^1151p2Hv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with increasing prevalence. CKD is associated with increased healthcare utilisation and costs as well as enhanced morbidity and mortality.

Most patients with CKD do not progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), but it is vital to identify those at high risk of progression to ESKD to enable advanced clinical care planning and communicate with patient/family education and counsel them on the impact of ESKD. Indeed, the number of people reaching ESKD is increasing worldwide and will have major impact on global healthcare systems. It is, therefore, essential to have strategies to identify those at highest risk to enable prioritised care and access to specialist renal services. A multifactorial approach can slow progression of CKD and reduce related enhanced cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and risk.

The four variable kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) is recommended to estimate the risk of kidney failure (KF) defined as need for dialysis or kidney transplantation and remains the most well-validated risk prediction tool, predicting the 2-year and 5-year risk of progression to KF in patients with CKD stages 3A-5. The four-variable KFRE incorporates age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI)and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) to predict the need for kidney replacement and transplantation within 2-year and 5-year time frames. The four-variable KFRE has been demonstrated to be accurate for risk prediction for KF. Healthcare systems have utilised thresholds of risk such as a 2-year KF risk of ≥ 40% to guide access to advanced kidney care services and planning for renal replacement therapies.

### Predicting the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease: multinational, longitudinal, population based, cohort study [^117ExBP9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Transportability (geographical testing)

To investigate to what extent KDpredict trained in Alberta, Canada, could be used as is in different regions, KDpredict was compared with the current benchmark model (kidney failure risk equation, which was developed in Canada)for two and five year kidney failure risk predictions (the only time periods that the kidney failure risk equation considers) in Denmark and Scotland. We present the comparison of KDpredict (without retraining or recalibration) to the recalibrated version of kidney failure risk equation in supplementary appendix 1. Since prediction time horizons of interest depend on disease severity, one to two year kidney failure risk predictions were evaluated only in people with stage G4 CKD in main analyses, and in the full cohort in secondary analyses. Different formulations of KDpredict (four or six variables) were also evaluated for one to five year risk predictions of kidney failure and death.

Performance measures

Risk scatterplots were used to assess potential disagreement between individualised predictions from rival models, with a prespecified meaningful difference of more than 10%. Calibration was evaluated using histogram type plots with groups defined by tenths of predicted risk. Numerical performance measures included time dependent Brier score (prediction error, a measure of both calibration and discrimination; the lower the better), index of prediction accuracy (calculated from the Brier score and representing the improvement in the Brier score compared with the null model; the higher the better), and inverse probability of censoring weighted estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (a measure of discrimination or ranking statistic; the higher the better). This area is blind to monotone transformations of risk (eg, adding 10% to each individual risk does not change the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), and hence cannot tell if a model is miscalibrated. The Brier score is a strictly proper scoring rule and a stand-alone measure for ranking rival models.

### A predictive model for progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure [^1143HfK2]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common. Kidney disease severity can be classified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, but more accurate information regarding risk for progression to kidney failure is required for clinical decisions about testing, treatment, and referral.

Objective

To develop and validate predictive models for progression of CKD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Development and validation of prediction models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 2 independent Canadian cohorts of patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated GFR, 10–59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) who were referred to nephrologists between April 1, 2001, and December 31, 2008. Models were developed using Cox proportional hazards regression methods and evaluated using C statistics and integrated discrimination improvement for discrimination, calibration plots and Akaike Information Criterion for goodness of fit, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) at 1, 3, and 5 years.

Main Outcome Measure

Kidney failure, defined as need for dialysis or preemptive kidney transplantation.

Results

The development and validation cohorts included 3449 patients (386 with kidney failure [11%]) and 4942 patients (1177 with kidney failure [24%]), respectively. The most accurate model included age, sex, estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum bicarbonate, and serum albumin (C statistic, 0.917; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.901–0.933 in the development cohort and 0.841; 95% CI, 0.825–0.857 in the validation cohort). In the validation cohort, this model was more accurate than a simpler model that included age, sex, estimated GFR, and albuminuria (integrated discrimination improvement, 3.2%; 95% CI, 2.4%-4.2%; calibration [Nam and D'Agostino χ² statistic, 19 vs 32]; and reclassification for CKD stage 3 [NRI, 8.0%; 95% CI, 2.1%-13.9%] and for CKD stage 4 [NRI, 4.1%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 8.8%]).

Conclusion

A model using routinely obtained laboratory tests can accurately predict progression to kidney failure in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^116pbMVy]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calibration showed an overestimation of risk at 5-years in the whole cohort but there was consistent underestimation of risk in patients with ADPKD at 2- and 5-years

With respect to calibration, we found the KFREs underestimated risk at 2-years and overestimated risk at 5-years, especially in patients with higher predicted risk scores. The overestimation of risk at 5-years is likely explained by the death-censored analysis, which was undertaken as per the original KFRE development study. We show in our sensitivity analysis that this approach does lead to an overestimation of the observed events of ESRD over time as compared to an analysis that treats death as a competing event, which has been shown to be the case in a recent analysis.

In contrast to the findings by Hundemer et al. we highlight that the KFRE had a poorer performance in patients with ADPKD in our cohort. For instance, ADPKD demonstrated the lowest AUC values amongst the disease categories across the 4- and 8-variable KFREs. Interestingly, this underperformance was statistically significant when compared with the discriminative ability of the 8-variable KFRE in patients with diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis within the 2-year analysis. This latter finding provides further compelling weight towards reliance on the 4-variable KFRE, especially in those with ADPKD. However, with respect to calibration, all the KFREs consistently underestimated the risk of ESRD in this patient group, which is of particular relevance given that patients with ADPKD had the highest proportion of ESRD at 2- and 5-years (Table 2). Renal progression in ADPKD is notably different to other disease aetiologies in that it can be characterised by rapid rates of decline, often in a linear fashion, and this reflects the genetically pre-determined expansion of renal cysts that destroy healthy parenchyma over time, and which is not influenced by modification of risk factors such as uACR. This disease mechanism is evidently not well predicted through the variables within the KFRE alone. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence that suggests that total kidney volume, calculated on ultrasonographic parameters, can be combined with the KFRE to afford better risk prediction performance in ADPKD but further work will be required to corroborate these findings. For now, based on our findings, we would argue using the KFREs with caution in patients with ADPKD.

### Predicting the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease: multinational, longitudinal, population based, cohort study [^114M7yns]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

We used Alberta health data to create a tool predicting one to five year risks of kidney failure and all cause death (KDpredict) in people with incident moderate to severe CKD (stage G3b to G4). In external testing in Denmark and Scotland, KDpredict consistently outperformed the current benchmark risk prediction model for kidney failure (kidney failure risk equation)and was well calibrated for the prediction of both kidney failure and death over one to five year time horizons. Similar results were observed in temporal testing of retrained models in Alberta. KDpredict is unique in its ability to provide accurate predictions of risk for both clinical outcomes in adults with this severity of CKD at the point of first onset, when a timely discussion should occur. By presenting risk predictions of both kidney failure and death, KDpredict supports patient centred care and holistic decision making. We translated KDpredict into a calculator for deployment and dissemination. The underlying super learner strategy of KDpredict would be suitable for implementation with or without revision in other regions, and regular reassessment over time within the same region.

Comparison with other studies

Superior performance of KDpredict compared with kidney failure risk equation may be due to accounting for death as a competing event. By treating death in the same way as loss to follow-up, the kidney failure risk equation intrinsically assumes that people can have kidney failure after death and systematically overestimates the risk of kidney failure.KDpredict provides risk predictions that are directly interpretable: a patient who receives a predicted two year risk of 11% can expect that 11 of 100 patients like them will develop kidney failure within two years. By contrast, predictions from the kidney failure risk equation do not have this interpretation, even if recalibrated. In a recent analysis of kidney failure risk equation performance, the original kidney failure risk equation was considered generally accurate for eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, except for long term predictions in older adults where a competing risks model may be preferable. Our analyses show that mortality is high also in people younger than 65 years and that the systematic overestimation by the kidney failure risk equation is clinically relevant both in short and long term predictions. Superior performance may also be due to the use of a super learner strategy that let the data select the best performing model or algorithm from a large library of prespecified candidate learners, without imposing restrictions. Notably, we could not compare the mortality prediction performance of KDpredict to similar tools, as none exists.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation in European CKD patients [^114b3o1d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for progression to kidney failure. Using data of Canadian CKD patients, Tangri et al. recently developed models to predict the progression of CKD stages 3–5 to kidney failure within 5 years. We validated this kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) in European CKD patients.

Methods

We selected non-transplanted patients with CKD stages 3–5 who participated in the MASTERPLAN study, a randomized controlled trial in patients with CKD. Kidney failure was defined as the initiation of chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation within 5 years. Patients who died before kidney failure were censored. Patients followed for < 5 years, who did not develop kidney failure and did not die, were excluded. The 5-year kidney failure risk was predicted using three different models developed by Tangri et al. and compared with the actual kidney failure rate in MASTERPLAN. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), the net reclassification index (NRI) and by comparing the observed and predicted rates of kidney failure.

Results

A total of 595 patients were included; 114 developed kidney failure. (Overall observed kidney failure risk in our cohort was 5% lower than in the Canadian validation cohort.) Discrimination of the eight-variable model [including age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, albumin] was similar to that of the four-variable model (including age, sex, eGFR, albuminuria) and the three-variable model (including age, sex, eGFR); ROC-AUCs were 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86–0.92], 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.91) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.92), respectively. Using the NRI, the eight-variable model slightly outperformed the four-variable model (NRI 6.5%) and the three-variable model (NRI 12.4%). The mean differences between the observed and predicted kidney failure risk were -4.0, -7.1 and -7.4% for the eight-, four-, and three-variable model, respectively.

Conclusions

The KFRE accurately predicted the progression to kidney failure in European CKD patients. Discrimination of the three models was similar. Calibration of the eight-variable model was slightly better than that of the simpler models. We question whether this outweighs its added complexity.

### Prediction of end-stage kidney disease using estimated glomerular filtration rate with and without race: a prospective cohort study [^113QUSqF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

New estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations removed race adjustment, but the impact of its removal on prediction of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is unknown.

Objective

To compare the ESKD prediction performance of different eGFR equations.

Design

Observational, prospective cohort study.

Setting

7 U.S. clinical centers.

Participants

3873 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study contributing 13 902 two-year risk periods.

Measurements

ESKD was defined as initiation of dialysis or transplantation. eGFR was calculated using 5 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations based on serum creatinine and/or cystatin C, with or without race adjustment. The predicted 2-year risk for ESKD was calculated using the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE). We evaluated the prediction performance of eGFR equations and the KFRE score using discrimination and calibration analyses.

Results

During a maximum 16 years of follow-up, 856 participants developed ESKD. Across all eGFR equations, the KFRE score was superior for predicting 2-year incidence of ESKD compared with eGFR alone (area under the curve ranges, 0.945 to 0.954 vs. 0.900 to 0.927). Prediction performance of KFRE scores using different eGFR equations was similar, but the creatinine equation without race adjustment improved calibration among Black participants. Among all participants, compared with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m², a KFRE score greater than 20% had similar specificity for predicting 2-year ESKD risk (ranges, 0.94 to 0.97 vs. 0.95 to 0.98) but higher sensitivity (ranges, 0.68 to 0.78 vs. 0.42 to 0.66).

Limitation

Data are solely from the United States.

Conclusion

The KFRE score better predicts 2-year risk for ESKD compared with eGFR alone, regardless of race adjustment. The creatinine equation with age and sex may improve calibration among Black patients. A KFRE score greater than 20% showed high specificity and sensitivity for predicting 2-year risk for ESKD.

Overall, the KFREs demonstrate better clinical utility than relying on eGFR to guide further management

Our validation study offers novel insight into the clinical impact of the 4- and 8-variable KFREs in an advanced CKD population by assessing clinical utility through decision curve analyses, which incorporates the measures of discrimination and calibration. We show that intervening on patients on the basis of a KFRE assessment was the optimal model of choice compared to using eGFR cut-offs of < 20 ml/min/1.73m² and < 15 ml/min/1.73m² over a range of appropriate threshold probabilities. Specifically, the 2-year KFREs were superior at the 40% ESRD threshold and the 5-year KFREs were superior at the 50% ESRD threshold, both thresholds identified in the literature as being relevant to guiding further care. This provides evidence for the overall accuracy of the KFREs in advanced CKD and suggests they can be relied upon more than eGFR alone to support clinical decisions.

The KFRE has good discrimination for 2- and 5-year risk prediction

We show that the 4-variable KFRE had good discrimination in the whole cohort for prediction of ESRD at 2- and 5-years with AUCs of 0.796 (95% CI 0.762–0.831) and 0.773 (95% CI 0.736–0.810) respectively. These were slightly lower than the AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.81–0.85) at 2-years and 0.81 (95% CI 0.77–0.84) at 5-years in the report by Hundemer et al. but the studies share similarly excellent discrimination for certain disease aetiologies such as diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy and glomerulonephritis at the 2-year time-point.

KFRE risk scores and outcome data

In the 2-year analysis, the median 2-year risk score for the 4- and 8-variable KFREs were similar at 24% (95% CI 11–42%) and 20% (95% CI 10–39%) respectively (Table 1), with the highest risk scores seen in patients with glomerulonephritis, followed by those with diabetic nephropathy. In the 5-year analysis cohort (Additional file 3), the median 4- and 8-variable 5-year risk scores were both 65% (95% CI of 36–88% for the 4-variable KFRE and 36–83% for the 8-variable KFRE). As per the 2-year analysis, the highest disease-specific 5-year risks for both the 4- and 8-variable KFREs were produced in those with glomerulonephritis followed by those with diabetic nephropathy.

Table 2 provides the outcome data for ESRD and death prior to ESRD in the whole cohort and across disease categories. For the 2-year analysis, 257 patients (35%) reached ESRD within 2-years, whilst 101 patients (14%) died prior to ESRD. In the 5-year analysis, 331 patients (54%) reached ERSD within 5-years and there were 164 deaths (27%) prior to ESRD.

### Analysis of the kidney failure risk equation implementation in routine clinical practice and health inequalities in chronic kidney disease care: a retrospective cohort study [^115BhkNf]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, affecting approximately 10% of the population globally. Although most people with CKD have mild disease with a slight reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a small proportion of people develop kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT: long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation). Identifying individuals with CKD at risk of progressing to kidney failure can be challenging and in the past, referrals from primary to secondary care primarily relied on eGFR thresholds (e.g. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2), resulting in some low-risk patients being referred. Risk prediction models– such as the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE)– aim to estimate the risk of kidney failure for an individual using clinical and demographic information. One of the main aims of prognostic models, like the KFRE, is to aid treatment decisions and to more accurately identify adults with CKD at elevated risk of kidney failure.

Clinical guidelines in the UK from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) incorporated the KFRE into CKD guidelines in 2021, suggesting that adults with a five-year risk of kidney failure greater than 5% be referred for specialist assessment. The KFRE is a simple tool, using age, sex, eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR). However, uACR testing amongst people with CKD has historically been low in the UK and globally, which challenges the implementation of KFRE in clinical practice.

In this study, we hypothesised that low uACR testing rates would be observed amongst patients with CKD, particularly for underserved groups such as women or those from more socioeconomically deprived areas. We sought to ascertain whether updated NICE guidelines from 2021, if used, would identify individuals at elevated risk of kidney failure earlier than older guidance which relied primarily on eGFR. We used data from a large population with linkage to renal health records, which allowed us to reliably identify CKD and kidney failure. We aimed to discover (1) what demographic variables were associated with availability of uACR results, (2) if referral criteria which included KFRE identified patients earlier than criteria based mainly on eGFR and (3) the predictive performance of KFRE for individuals who had uACR results available.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112uyb2e]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

End-stage kidney disease risk prediction models in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — We suggest the use of a validated, end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). Both versions of the KFRE (4-variable and 8-variable) have high discriminatory ability to differentiate between those who develop kidney failure from those who do not, and the KFRE was validated in a meta-analysis that included > 725,000 participants from over 31 different cohorts representing 30 countries. The CKD Prognosis Consortium has also developed models to predict the risk of > 40% decline in eGFR, development of advanced CKD, and progression to kidney failure. Use of a validated risk prediction equation may help providers counsel patients, guide care, and optimize resource utilization targeting those at higher risk for progression, specifically patients with stage G3 or higher CKD, and kidney failure risk prediction may also assist with identifying individuals who need more intensive management or who may benefit from multidisciplinary care. The evidence base includes studies that were of Low quality and primarily outside the U.S.; Major et al. in the United Kingdom noted that adoption of KFRE in primary care increased the overall referrals to nephrology for CKD care while reducing unnecessary referrals, and using VA data, Duggal and colleagues noted that current laboratory-based guidelines for nephrology referral identified patients who were, on average, at low risk for progression, most of whom were not referred. Despite prior evidence of utility, studies comparing different risk prediction equations on their impact on referral patterns, clinical quality metrics, and clinical outcomes are limited; further, most new models were compared to the KFRE without examining their impact on clinical practice (e.g., whether they can augment UACR testing or adopt evidence-based therapy), and to establish the superiority of one equation or model over another, additional studies are warranted. Findings from the patient focus group emphasized informing the patient about the risk of kidney disease progression, and such risk prediction tools can be easily implemented within electronic medical records and help facilitate appropriate use of resources.

Recalibration of KFRE equations for SEA

We fit a Cox proportional hazards model using the same variables included in the Original KFRE (age, 70 years; 56% men, eGFR, 36 mL/min/1.73 m², ACR 170 mg/g) and explored the baseline hazard and regression coefficients for the recalibration of KFRE equations for SEA population. We formed one recalibrated KFRE equation (Recalibrated Original KFRE SEA 1) by changing the baseline hazard in the Original KFRE, and formed one recalibrated KFRE (Recalibrated Original KFRE SEA 2) by changing both the baseline hazard and regression coefficients in the Original KFRE (Additional file 1 and Additional file 2). We also recalibrated the Pooled KFRE by changing the baseline hazard in a stepwise manner to look for an equation with the best calibration (Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA) (Additional file 1, Additional file 2 and Additional file 3).

Metrics for equation performance

The metrics used to compare the calibration (how closely the predicted risks agree with the observed risks) among different KFRE equations were the Brier score, bias, and precision. The Brier score was calculated as the squared difference of mean observed minus predicted risks weighted according to the sample sizes in five risk categories (for 5 years, 0 to < 5%, 5 to < 15%, 15 to < 25%, 25 to < 50%, and ≥ 50%; for 2 years, 0 to < 2%, 2 to < 6%, 6 to < 10%, 10 to < 20%, and ≥ 20%) adopted from prior studies. Bias was expressed as the median difference between observed minus predicted risks and precision was the interquartile range of bias. A KFRE equation with the lowest score of all three metrics would be chosen as the best-calibrated equation.

Discrimination and risk reclassification

We used area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the best-calibrated KFRE equation as a continuous variable to that of continuous eGFR. We also used category-free net reclassification improvement (NRI) to compare the KFRE with eGFR: we assessed that how many more patients with ESKD were correctly assigned to higher predicted risks, as well as patients without ESKD to lower risks by using KFRE versus eGFR. We also applied AUC and NRI to compare between different KFRE equations.

### Kidney failure risk equation and cost of care in patients with chronic kidney disease [^11756iRb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with CKD exhibit heterogeneity in their rates of progression to kidney failure. The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) has been shown to accurately estimate progression to kidney failure in adults with CKD. Our objective was to determine health care utilization patterns of patients on the basis of their risk of progression.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with CKD and eGFR of 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 enrolled in multidisciplinary CKD clinics in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Data were collected from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2012 and followed for 5 years (December 31, 2017). We stratified patients by eGFR and risk of progression and compared the number and cost of hospital admissions, physician visits, and prescription drugs.

Results

In total, 1003 adults were included in the study. Within the eGFR of 15–29 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 group, the costs of hospital admissions, physician visits, and drug dispensations over the 5-year study period comparing high-risk patients with low-risk patients were (Canadian dollars) $89,265 versus $48,374 (P = 0.008), $23,423 versus $11,231 (P < 0.001), and $21,853 versus $16,757 (P = 0.01), respectively. Within the eGFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 group, the costs of hospital admissions, physician visits, and prescription drugs were $55,944 versus $36,740 (P = 0.10), $13,414 versus $10,370 (P = 0.08), and $20,394 versus $14,902 (P = 0.02) in high-risk patients in comparison with low-risk patients, respectively, for progression to kidney failure.

Conclusions

In patients with CKD and eGFR of 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 followed in multidisciplinary clinics, the costs of hospital admissions, physician visits, and drugs were higher for patients at higher risk of progression to kidney failure by the KFRE compared with patients in the low-risk category. The high-risk group of patients with CKD and eGFR of 15–29 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 had stronger association with hospitalizations costs, physician visits, and drug utilizations.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^113R5uUh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

At 5 years, we used eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73m² (sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.71) as reference to compare with thresholds of Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA because the eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 sensitivity was suboptimal (0.70 [0.68–0.72]), and eGFR 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73m² specificities were low (0.56 [0.55–0.57] and 0.01 [0.00–0.02]). Using eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73m² would identify 5283 (30%) patients requiring referral to a nephrologist, and this number was substantially higher than the 3506 (20%) of KFRE > 10%, and 2308 (13%) of the Youden Index-determined KFRE > 16%. Moreover, using KFRE thresholds ranging 10–16%, nephrologists need to evaluate 5.6 (5.0–6.0) to 7.8 (7.2–8.5) patients with CKD to find one ESKD case, and this resulted in higher referral efficiency than the 12.2 (11.1–13.3) patients using eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73m 2. In addition to the higher referral efficiency, KFRE thresholds 10–16% also had similar sensitivity (0.86 [0.85–0.87] to 0.91 [0.90–0.92] vs. 0.88 [0.87–0.89]), higher specificity (0.82 [0.81–0.83] to 0.89 [0.88–0.90] vs. 0.71 [0.70–0.72]), higher PPV (0.10 [0.09–0.11] to 0.16 [0.14–0.18] vs. 0.08 [0.07–0.09]), similar NPV (0.995 [0.980–1.010] to 0.997 [0.990–1.004] vs. 0.995 [0.986–1.004]), and higher LR+ (5.01 [5.00–5.26] to 7.67 [7.14–8.33] vs. 3.03 [2.94–3.13]) compared to eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 (Table 4).

### Utility of the kidney failure risk equation and estimated GFR for estimating time to kidney failure in advanced CKD [^1134nZSQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) predicts the 2-year risk of kidney failure for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Translating KFRE-predicted risk or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into time to kidney failure could inform decision making for patients approaching kidney failure.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting & Participants

CKD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDOPPS) cohort of patients with an eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m² from 34 US nephrology practices (2013–2021).

Exposure

2-year KFRE risk or eGFR.

Outcome

Kidney failure defined as initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Analytical Approach

Accelerated failure time (Weibull) models used to estimate the median, 25th, and 75th percentile times to kidney failure starting from KFRE values of 20%, 40%, and 50%, and from eGFR values of 20, 15, and 10mL/min/1.73m². We examined variability in time to kidney failure by age, sex, race, diabetes status, albuminuria, and blood pressure.

Results

Overall, 1,641 participants were included (mean age 69 ± 13 years; median eGFR of 28mL/min/1.73m² [IQR 20–37mL/min/1.73 m²]). Over a median follow-up period of 19 months (IQR, 12–30 months), 268 participants developed kidney failure, and 180 died before reaching kidney failure. The median estimated time to kidney failure was widely variable across patient characteristics from an eGFR of 20mL/min/1.73m 2 and was shorter for younger age, male sex, Black (versus non-Black), diabetes (vs no diabetes), higher albuminuria, and higher blood pressure. Estimated times to kidney failure were comparably less variable across these characteristics for KFRE thresholds and eGFR of 15 or 10mL/min/1.73m 2.

Limitations

Inability to account for competing risks when estimating time to kidney failure.

Conclusions

Among those with eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m² or KFRE risk > 40%), both KFRE risk and eGFR showed similar relationships with time to kidney failure. Our results demonstrate that estimating time to kidney failure in advanced CKD can inform clinical decisions and patient counseling on prognosis, regardless of whether estimates are based on eGFR or the KFRE.

Plain-Language Summary

Clinicians often talk to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease about the level of kidney function expressed as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and about the risk of developing kidney failure, which can be estimated using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE). In a cohort of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, we examined how eGFR and KFRE risk predictions corresponded to the time patients had until reaching kidney failure. Among those with eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m 2 or KFRE risk > 40%), both KFRE risk and eGFR showed similar relationships with time to kidney failure. Estimating time to kidney failure in advanced CKD using either eGFR or KFRE can inform clinical decisions and patient counseling on prognosis.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^1169BcfD]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study provides for the first time a comprehensive, independent, geographical validation of both the 4- and 8-variable KFREs in advanced CKD in a UK-based cohort with specific evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility. We also provide insight into the applicability of the KFRE in an advanced kidney care clinic setting by focussing attention on the importance of communicating risk to patients, facilitating pre-emptive transplant and planning for AV fistula formation. This will be of significance to institutions who are considering the merits of using the KFRE in their practices.

There are important limitations to our work. Firstly, there may have been misclassification of patients with diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy as the majority of these patients had not undergone a renal biopsy. This, however, is reflective of routine practice where the clinical probability of these particular diseases typically outweighs the risk of undergoing a biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. Nonetheless, our patient characteristics are in keeping with what we would expect in specific disease aetiologies, notably with higher levels of albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy compared with hypertensive nephropathy. Secondly, we were dependent on converting uPCR to uACR for all our patients, which may have impacted the predicted risk scores, but the online conversion tool we used has been shown to be effective with KFRE calculations. Finally, our study cohort originated from a single-centre and was largely Caucasian, which limits the generalisability of our results to other diverse clinical settings.

Comparison of performance

The Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA had the best calibration among all KFREs in terms of having the smallest Brier score (squared difference of mean observed minus predicted risks; square root: 2.8% vs. 4.0–9.3% at 5 years; 2.0% vs. 6.1–9.1% at 2 years), the least bias (median difference between observed minus predicted risks; 2.5% [− 2.0–4.5%] vs. 3.3–5.2% at 5 years; 1.8% [− 1.7–3.5%] vs. 3.2–3.6% at 2 years), and the best precision (interquartile range of bias; 0.5% vs.1.7–5.2% at 5 years; 0.5% vs. 3.5–4.2% at 2 years) (Table 2). Compared to the observed risks, the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA slightly underestimated the predicted ESKD risks at lower KFRE risk categories (< 25% at 5 years; < 20% at 2 years), and slightly overestimated the predicted risks at higher risk categories (≥ 25% at 5 years; ≥ 20% at 2 years) (Additional file 5).

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^113VKWBt]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, total mortality for chronic kidney disease (CKD) rose by 31.7% from 2005 to 2015 worldwide. CKD stage 3 or worse (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) that requires costly therapy including dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Timely referral to nephrologists has shown to improve survival on dialysis and reduce medical costs among patients who begin renal replacement therapy. Although a variety of factors may influence a decision for nephrologist referral, typical eGFR thresholds in clinical guidelines have varied from < 30, < 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Based on experts' opinions, a systematic review suggested that referral at eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 is likely to be more cost-effective than at eGFR < 40 ml/min/1.73m 2. However, automated referrals for non-dialysis CKD have not been instituted in clinical practice and would likely overwhelm the health system as nephrologists are in short supply globally, with relative numbers of nephrologists ranging from 1 per million population in Southeast Asia to 31 per million in Western Europe. Heavy nephrologist caseload has been associated with mortality of dialysis patients, and less timely access to treatment for patients at higher risk of ESKD. Therefore, accurate prediction scores to identify high-risk patients for ESKD are vital for efficient patient triage, decreasing waiting time and allocating limited resources to patients at highest risk. In 2011, a predictive model called the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) incorporating four variables (age, sex, eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR]) or eight variables (age, sex, eGFR, ACR, serum calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and albumin) was developed with excellent predictive performance for ESKD risk in a Canadian population. Subsequently, the Original KFRE equation has been validated in more than 30 countries, recalibrated for non-North Americans using primarily European populations, and a Pooled KFRE equation has also been developed. However, these KFRE equations were developed and evaluated primarily in patients visiting the nephrology clinics. CKD is largely asympotmatic, and the vast majority of patients (up to 90%), especially with earlier stages of CKD, are unaware of their conditions. Therefore, a well-performing KFRE would be highly relevant to the primary care settings to identify the fast progressors to ESKD. The Southeast Asian (SEA) population has been shown to have a heavy burden of ESKD and may experience faster progression of CKD to ESKD compared to Caucasians. However, the existing KFRE equations have not been evaluated in the SEA population.

Discussion

This validation study shows that the use of the 4- and 8-variable KFREs can be of clinical utility in an advanced CKD population and offers evidence for switching towards a risk-based model of care above one that relies solely on eGFR thresholds to trigger intervention in high-risk patients.

We undertook a similar study to the one reported by Hundemer et al. who recently provided a closer evaluation of the 4-variable KFRE in patients with advanced CKD and in specific disease categories, which had hitherto been lacking. The median eGFR of 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 (12–19 ml/min/1.73m 2) in their work closely matches the 16 ml/min/1.73m 2 (13–18 ml/min/1.73m 2) in ours and we share similar baseline patient characteristics of age and sex. The rates of ESRD were higher in their study compared to ours (42% and 64% reached ESRD at 2- and 5-years compared to 35% and 54% in our study), and this was reflected in higher KFRE risk scores. Nonetheless, we similarly found that patients with glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy had the highest disease-specific risk scores whereas those with hypertensive nephropathy and ADPKD had the lowest. Our work extends upon the study by Hundemer et al. with a geographical validation of the KFREs in a UK cohort and we provide the following four main contributions:

The 4-variable KFRE is sufficient for risk prediction in advanced CKD

We show for the first time that the 8-variable KFRE performs on par with its 4-variable counterpart for patients in the whole cohort and across disease aetiologies. The 8-variable KFRE has previously been shown to have a slightly better risk prediction compared to the 4-variable KFRE and we hypothesised that the 8-variable KFRE may have a better performance given its extended parameters captures abnormalities more prevalent in advanced CKD. However, our finding suggests the 4-variable KFRE is more than adequate for risk prediction in this patient group, likely due to the important predictive power of eGFR and albuminuria at later stages of CKD. In this regard, by using less variables, the 4-variable KFRE presents an attractively accessible tool for estimating future risk of ESRD across CKD stages 3a-5.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

The four variable kidney failure (KF) risk equation (KFRE) is recommended to estimate KF risk (ie, need for dialysis or kidney transplantation). Earlier referral to clinical kidney services for people with high-risk of kidney failure can ensure appropriate care, education and support are in place pre-emptively. There are limited data on investigating the performance of KFRE in estimating risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary ESKD endpoint event was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and secondary endpoint eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

Research design and methods

We studied 7296 people (30% women, 41% African-Caribbean, 45% Caucasian) with T2DM and CKD (eGFR median (range) 48 (15–59) mL/min/1.73 m 2) were included at two hospitals in London (median follow-up 10.2 years). Time to ESKD event was the endpoint and Concordance index (C-index) was used to assess KFRE's discrimination of those experiencing ESKD from those who did not. Mean (integrated calibration index (ICI)) and 90th percentile (E90) of the difference between observed and predicted risks were used as calibration metrics.

Results

Of the cohort 746 (10.2%) reached ESKD primary event (135 (1.9%) and 339 (4.5%) over 2 and 5 years, respectively). Similarly, 1130 (15.5%) reached the secondary endpoint (270 (3.7%) and 547 (7.5%) over 2 and 5 years, respectively). The C-index for the primary endpoint was 0.842 (95% CI 0.836 to 0.848) and 0.816 (95% CI 0.812 to 0.820) for 2 and 5 years, respectively. KFRE 'under-predicted' ESKD risk overall and by ethnic group. Likewise, the C-index for secondary endpoint was 0.843 (0.839–0.847) and 0.801 (0.798–0.804) for 2 and 5 years, respectively. KFRE performance analysis performed more optimally with the primary endpoint with 50% enhancement of the calibration metrics than with the secondary endpoint. KFRE recalibration improved ICI by 50% and E90 by more than 78%.

Conclusions

Although derived for predicting KF, KFRE also demonstrated good discrimination for ESKD outcome. Further studies are needed to identify variables/biomarkers that may improve KFRE's performance/calibration and to aid the development of other predictive models to enable early identification of people at risk of advanced stages of CKD prior to onset of KF.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not a benign condition given worsening kidney function is an independent risk factor for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Accurately predicting ESRD is a cornerstone of optimal CKD care as it enables targeted treatment in high-risk patients, including supporting better risk communication with patients and appropriate prioritisation of treatment pathways that include education regarding renal replacement therapies (RRT), especially the benefits of pre-emptive living donor kidney transplantation.

To date, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) remains the most well-validated risk prediction tool, predicting the 2- and 5-year risk of progression to ESRD in patients with CKD stages 3a-5. The 4-variable KFRE requires age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, whilst the 8-variable KFRE incorporates the additional parameters of serum calcium, phosphate, albumin and bicarbonate. Not only has the KFRE been shown to be accurate for risk prediction but absolute risk thresholds have been implemented into clinical care systems, such as a 2-year ESRD risk of ≥ 40% to guide dialysis access planning in patients who have chosen future dialysis.

### Performance of the kidney failure risk equation by disease etiology in advanced CKD [^113Asrhn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The kidney failure risk equation is a clinical tool commonly used for prediction of progression from CKD to kidney failure. The kidney failure risk equation's accuracy in advanced CKD and whether this varies by CKD etiology remains unknown. This study examined the kidney failure risk equation's discrimination and calibration at 2 and 5 years among a large tertiary care population with advanced CKD from heterogeneous etiologies.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This retrospective cohort study included 1293 patients with advanced CKD (median eGFR 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) referred to the Ottawa Hospital Multi-Care Kidney Clinic between 2010 and 2016, with follow-up clinical data available through 2018. Four-variable kidney failure risk equation scores for 2- and 5-year risks of progression to kidney failure (defined as dialysis or kidney transplantation) were calculated upon initial referral and correlated with the subsequent observed kidney failure incidence within these time frames. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration plots were used to measure the discrimination and calibration of the kidney failure risk equation both in the overall advanced CKD population and by CKD etiology: diabetic kidney disease, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, GN, polycystic kidney disease, and other. Pairwise comparisons of the receiver operating characteristic curves by CKD etiology were performed to compare kidney failure risk equation discrimination.

Results

The kidney failure risk equation provided adequate to excellent discrimination in identifying patients with CKD likely to progress to kidney failure at the 2- and 5-year time points both overall (2-year area under the curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 0.85; 5-year area under the curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.84) and across CKD etiologies. The kidney failure risk equation displayed adequate calibration at the 2- and 5-year time points both overall and across CKD etiologies (Hosmer-Lemeshow P ≥ 0.05); however, the predicted risks of kidney failure were higher than the observed risks across CKD etiologies with the exception of polycystic kidney disease.

Conclusions

The kidney failure risk equation provides adequate discrimination and calibration in advanced CKD and across CKD etiologies.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^116coTUB]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), which predicts ESKD risk among patients with CKD, has not been validated in primary care clinics in Southeast Asia (SEA). Therefore, we aimed to (1) evaluate the performance of existing KFRE equations, (2) recalibrate KFRE for better predictive precision, and (3) identify optimally feasible KFRE thresholds for nephrologist referral and dialysis planning in SEA.

Methods

All patients with CKD visiting nine primary care clinics from 2010 to 2013 in Singapore were included and applied 4-variable KFRE equations incorporating age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). ESKD onset within two and five years were acquired via linkage to the Singapore Renal Registry. A weighted Brier score (the squared difference between observed vs predicted ESKD risks), bias (the median difference between observed vs predicted ESKD risks) and precision (the interquartile range of the bias) were used to select the best-calibrated KFRE equation.

Results

The recalibrated KFRE (named Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA) performed better than existing and other recalibrated KFRE equations in terms of having a smaller Brier score (square root: 2.8% vs. 4.0–9.3% at 5 years; 2.0% vs. 6.1–9.1% at 2 years), less bias (2.5% vs. 3.3–5.2% at 5 years; 1.8% vs. 3.2–3.6% at 2 years), and improved precision (0.5% vs. 1.7–5.2% at 5 years; 0.5% vs. 3.8–4.2% at 2 years). Area under ROC curve for the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA equations were 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93 to 0.95) at 5 years and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95 to 0.97) at 2 years. The optimally feasible KFRE thresholds were > 10–16% for 5-year nephrologist referral and > 45% for 2-year dialysis planning. Using the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA, an estimated 82 and 89% ESKD events were included among 10% of subjects at highest estimated risk of ESKD at 5-year and 2-year, respectively.

Conclusions

### Towards the best kidney failure prediction tool: a systematic review and selection aid [^115ESb6c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may lead to kidney failure, although the rates of progression vary substantially between individuals. Prediction tools that can identify patients at high risk of developing kidney failure could have great clinical value. They could be used to inform individualized decision making, employed in determining the appropriate time for referral to nephrologists and used in the planning and preparation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Prediction tools might also offer opportunities for risk stratification in research and improvement of health policies.

Multiple prediction models have been developed to identify individuals at high risk of kidney failure and have been previously described in two systematic reviews. Many of these models showed good predictive abilities in development. However, despite nephrologists and patients acknowledging a lack of prognosis discussions in practice, clinical uptake of these tools is still limited. Policymakers also seem hesitant in endorsing prediction tools. The most recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends the use of prediction models for timely referral for planning RRT. However, the guideline, fails to provide guidance on which risk prediction tool should be used to do so. The lack of uptake by clinicians and policymakers has been partly attributed to substandard methodology, a lack of external validation and a shortage of easy calculation options.

The last two published reviews in 2012 and 2013 included eight studies each on prediction of kidney failure in CKD patients. Since then the number of available models has greatly increased. A new systematic review of the available models is the first step towards the use and recommendation of robust prognostic tools. The aim of the current study is therefore to systematically review all available models predicting kidney failure in CKD patients, organize empirical evidence on their validity and ultimately provide guidance in the selection of the best prediction tool for various settings.

### Development and validation of a machine learning model to predict time to renal replacement therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116RhMp2]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of dialysis patients is increasing globally and is expected to be 3.8 million people worldwide by 2021. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a concept proposed for the early detection of renal dysfunction, and it is estimated that 9.1% of the world's population is affected by CKD. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline provides a heat map of the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline recommends the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) as a criterion for referral to a nephrologist. However, CKD patients often delay referral to a nephrologist or discontinue seeing a nephrologist because of a lack of subjective symptoms and their reluctance to continue treatment.

### Predictive models in chronic kidney disease: essential tools in clinical practice [^111UYysg]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The integration of risk prediction in managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) is universally considered a key point of routine clinical practice to guide time-sensitive choices, such as dialysis access planning or counseling on kidney transplant options. Several prognostic models have been developed and validated to provide individualized evaluation of kidney failure risk in CKD patients. This review aims to analyze the current evidence on existing predictive models and evaluate the different advantages and disadvantages of these tools.

Recent Findings

Since Tangri et al. introduced the Kidney Failure Risk Equation in 2011, the nephrological scientific community focused its interest in enhancing available algorithms and finding new prognostic equations. Although current models can predict kidney failure with high discrimination, different questions remain unsolved. Thus, this field is open to new possibilities and discoveries.

Summary

Accurately informing patients of their prognoses can result in tailored therapy with important clinical and psychological implications. Over the last 5years, the number of disease-modifying therapeutic options has considerably increased, providing possibilities to not only prevent the kidney failure onset in patients with advanced CKD but also delay progression from early stages in at-risk individuals.

### Risk prediction in chronic kidney disease: pitfalls and caveats [^114XMg6b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to describe the challenges and highlight recent advances in the field of risk prediction for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We first focus on methods of model development and metrics of model performance in general, and then highlight important risk prediction tools for patients with CKD, for prediction of kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

Recent Findings

Investigators have used data from patients with CKD stages 1–5 and developed models for predicting the progression to kidney failure and all-cause mortality. Models for kidney failure have included estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, demographic and laboratory variables, and have achieved excellent discrimination. In contrast, model performance for prediction of all-cause mortality has been relatively modest. No validated models exist for predicting the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.

Summary

Models for predicting kidney failure in patients with CKD are highly accurate and clinically usable. The kidney failure risk equation includes routinely collected laboratory data and can predict the progression of CKD to kidney failure with accuracy. Additional validation of the risk equation and development of new models for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD are needed.

We also presented detailed statistics of a wide range of KFRE thresholds (3–21% at 5 year; 5–45% at 2 years) and observed that although using a higher KFRE threshold would refer fewer patients to a nephrologist to find one ESKD case, the sensitivity associated with KFRE also became less optimal (Fig. 4).

### Predicting the outcomes of chronic kidney disease in older adults [^114MQZ9g]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical prediction models use mathematical functions to combine information from an individual's characteristics and use the resulting output to estimate the chances that a condition of interest is present (diagnostic models) or will occur in the future (prognostic models). These estimates are in turn used to start or withhold treatments, to order new tests, or to educate individuals on their condition's outlook.

Prediction models are increasingly used in clinical medicine. In nephrology, estimators of kidney function are used to predict glomerular filtration rate because the direct measure of kidney function is not feasible in routine settings. In people already diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, prediction models are used to estimate the risk of progression to renal replacement therapy and to predict other outcomes such as mortality or cardiovascular diseases.

In a linked BMJ paper, Ping Liu and colleagues (doi:) report the development and evaluation of KDpredict, a suite of new models for predicting future kidney failure and all cause mortality in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease over one to five years. KDpredict was developed using the super learner strategy based on machine learning. The super learner is a prediction method designed to find the best combination from a collection of prediction algorithms (also known as learners). Prediction algorithms are ranked according to prediction error (Brier score) — a measure of discrepancy between the expected risk of a particular outcome (from the model derived from a training dataset) and the risk observed in a validation dataset. A lower prediction error indicates a better model performance.

The KDpredict investigators used the discrete super learner approach for evaluation, which selects the best prediction algorithm from a library of prespecified algorithms. They developed KDpredict using data from a cohort of patients in Alberta (Canada) and externally validated the model using patient cohorts from Denmark and Scotland. KDpredict showed that risk of death over five years was higher than the risk of progression to kidney failure in most subgroups with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease at baseline. The model's performance was excellent when tested in the Danish and Scottish cohorts.

Traditionally, the kidney failure risk equation (known as KFRE), also developed in Canada, has been the benchmark model for predicting outcomes among people with chronic kidney disease, using the same core predictors as KDpredict. When both models were tested in patient cohorts from Denmark and Scotland, KDpredict performed better than the kidney failure risk equation at predicting end-stage kidney failure.

### Individualized risk of CKD progression among US adults [^113dpFuo]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE), published in 2011, allowed for the estimation of an individual's absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. It was derived and validated using two Canadian cohortsand later validated using 31 multinational cohorts by the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC). Recently, CKD-PC developed and validated a risk metric to determine an individual's absolute 3-year risk of eGFR decline by ≥ 40% or kidney failure (3-year risk). This was developed in 707,931 and validated in 913,888 individuals, with 88% having eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. The 3-year risk differs from the KFRE in three ways. Its composite end point is CKD progression or kidney failure as opposed to kidney failure alone. It incorporates ten other well-established risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) in addition to UACR and eGFR. Finally, it has been validated in those with preserved (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and reduced (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) eGFR, thus making it applicable for any patient regardless of the presence or absence of a CKD diagnosis. We sought to understand the distribution of the individual-level risk of CKD progression in the US population, with and without CKD as currently defined, and evaluated how current CKD screening guidelines affect those with the highest absolute risk of CKD progression.

### Machine learning models to predict end-stage kidney disease in chronic kidney disease stage 4 [^116Takrb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, while we used data from five different hospitals, they were all part of Mount Sinai and we have not tested the generalizability of these models on external data. Secondly, proteinuria, a known risk factor of CKD progression, was missing in more than 42% of the cohort and was excluded from the analysis. Although this is representative of current practice, and we aimed to develop prediction models using real-world EHR data, a further study on the more widespread availability of proteinuria may enhance the performance of the models and should be addressed in future studies. Lastly, our models did not take into account the competing risk of death, which plays an essential role in risk assessment for patients with advanced CKD who are older and frail. A previous study revealed that the 5-year Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), one of the existing prediction models used in clinical practice, overestimated risk by 10–18% due to the competing risk of death. However, in our cohort, the mortality rate of CKD 4 patients is much lower than that reported in previous studies. Consequently, the conventional and competing risk analyses yielded similar results (Fig. 1). Further studies should prioritize the external validation of these models and explore the utilization of competing risk models that account for mortality, particularly in cohorts characterized by higher mortality rates among CKD stage 4 patients. Furthermore, exploring the effectiveness of alternative deep learning models is warranted. Finally, it is crucial to investigate the impact of implementing these models in clinical management and assess outcomes in clinical trials.

Clinical utility

The decision analysis curves in Fig. 4 show the 4- and 8-variable KFREs are better for guiding further intervention at relevant threshold probabilities compared to using eGFR cut-offs at < 20 ml/min/1.73m² and < 15 ml/min/1.73m².

Fig. 4
Decision curves analyses for the 4- and 8-variable KFREs at 2- and 5-years. The decision curves show that the both the 4- and 8-variable KFREs produced the highest net benefit for patients at 40% ESRD risk at 2-years and 50% ESRD risk at 5-years when compared to using eGFR thresholds of < 20 ml/min/1.73m 2 and < 15 ml/min/1.73m 2. Abbreviations: eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), in ml/min/1.73m 2; KFRE (Kidney Failure Risk Equation)

When compared with an eGFR cut-off of < 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 at a 40% threshold probability, the 4-variable 2-year KFRE was able to identify an extra 8 patients per 100 that would progress to ESRD and identify 13 more patients per 100 for whom intervention could be delayed. The median time-to-ESRD for patients with a 2-year KFRE risk of ≥ 40% was approximately 11 months (6–19 months).

At a 50% risk threshold, the 4-variable 5-year KFRE identified 14 extra patients per 100 who would progress to ESRD and could identify delaying intervention in 14 more patients per 100 when compared with using an eGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73m 2. In addition, it was able to identify 15 more true positive cases per 100 patients and 15 extra true negative cases compared with using an eGFR of < 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 to guide further treatment. The median time-to-ESRD for patients with a 5-year KFRE risk of ≥ 50% was approximately 20 months (10–37 months).

The net benefit results of the 4-variable KFRE were similarly seen when using the 8-variable KFRE for 2- and 5-year risk prediction.

Proportion of cases followed [PCF(p)] and proportion of the population needed to be follow [PNF(q)]

PCF(p) and PNF(q) were two recently developed measures that are highly relevant to the decision making in public health. PCF(p) represents the proportion of individuals who will develop disease who are included in the proportion p of individuals in the population of the highest risk, and PNF(q) is the proportion of the general population at highest risk that one needs to follow in order that a proportion q of those destined to become cases will be followed. For the equation with best calibration and predictive performance, we further calculated the PCF(p) and PNF(q) for the public health implication.

Explore the optimally feasible KFRE threshold in southeast Asians

For the best-calibrated KFRE equation, we applied the Youden Index to determine a statistically dichotomous risk threshold ('low' versus 'high'). The statistical threshold had the highest summation of the sensitivity and specificity. We compared the statistical KFRE thresholds identified in the current population to the 3, 5, and 10% at 5 years and 20 and 40% at 2 years, and also compared KFRE-based criteria to eGFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73m² at 5 years and 20 ml/min/1.73m² at 2 years suggested by Tangri et al. We also compared KFRE thresholds with eGFRs that captured the same proportions of patients in this population to test the robustness of the results. The selection of the optimally feasible thresholds was based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and balanced by service-related considerations of (i) total number of patients with CKD referred to nephrologists, and (ii) number of patients with CKD needed to be evaluated by nephrologists to identify one patient who will progress to ESKD.

In addition to the KDIGO heatmap, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a validated tool used by clinicians in over 30 countries and recommended by the 2024 KDIGO guideline to provide a 2- and 5-year-probability of kidney failure in individuals with advanced CKD (G stages 3–5) by using the individual's UACR, eGFR, sex, and age. Physicians should be aware of this tool as it has demonstrated excellent discrimination in individuals with advanced CKD who are likely to progress to kidney failure at the 2- and 5-year time points and across CKD etiologies (link:

### A novel kidney failure prediction model in individuals with CKD: impact of serum bilirubin levels [^1158288x]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health concern with rising incidence, poor outcomes, and significant economic costs. Individuals with CKD are at high risk of cardiovascular events and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Predicting the progression of CKD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Consequently, many prediction models for the progression of CKD to ESKD have been reported. Each prediction model is unique, incorporating various combinations of variables. Among these, the most widely used kidney failure risk equations (KFREs) are the 4-variable and 8-variable equations proposed by Tangri et al. The 4-variable KFRE includes age, gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), while the 8-variable KFRE additionally includes serum calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and albumin. The 4-variable equation has gained broader usage due to its convenience in clinical practice. However, it relies on only 2 nonmodifiable variables (age and gender) in addition to the traditional Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk-stratified components (eGFR and albuminuria). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the potential for enhancing the predictive performance of the 4-variable KFRE by incorporating novel additional variables.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^1116LGp4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

For baseline characteristics, continuous data is presented as median with interquartile ranges and categorical data as absolute numbers with percentages. The predictive performance of the 4- and 8-variable KFREs at 2- and 5-years were evaluated using discrimination and calibration metrics for the whole cohort and for patients in the five disease categories.

Discrimination, which is the extent a model can differentiate patients with or without the study outcome based on the risk score, was defined by the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC), along with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Perfect discrimination amounts to an AUC of 1.0. We defined acceptable discrimination by an AUC of 0.6–0.7, good discrimination as an AUC of 0.7–0.8, whilst values > 0.8 represented excellent discrimination. Pairwise comparisons of the AUCs were undertaken using DeLong's method to assess for differences in discrimination performance between the 4- and 8-variable KFREs in the whole cohort and between each disease group separately.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^111PGfxR]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

For the 5-year analysis, the 4-variable KFRE showed good discrimination in the whole cohort with an AUC of 0.773 (95% CI 0.736–0.810) and good discrimination was seen in the other disease categories except for ADPKD, which showed a much lower AUC of 0.600 (95% CI 0.328–0.872). These findings were similarly reproduced with the 8-variable 5-year calculations (Table 4).

Pairwise comparisons of all the ROC curves between each of the disease categories did not show any statistically significant differences except between patients with ADPKD compared with those with diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis, but this only applied to the 8-variable 2-year KFRE (Additional file 5).

KFRE calibration performance

The calibration plots in Fig. 3 show adequate calibration for the 4- and 8-variable KFREs at 2- and 5-years but there was a tendency for underestimation of risk scores in the 2-year analysis, whereas overestimation of risk was more notably seen in the 5-year calibration plots for both the 4- and 8-variable KFREs. These differences in risk prediction were also borne out in the tabulated calibration data across disease aetiologies shown in Additional file 6, with the exception being patients with ADPKD, for whom the KFRE consistently underestimated the observed events in all calculations in the 2- and 5-year analyses.

### Kidney failure prediction models: a comprehensive external validation study in patients with advanced CKD [^111KoqbU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Various prediction models have been developed to predict the risk of kidney failure in patients with CKD. However, guideline-recommended models have yet to be compared head to head, their validation in patients with advanced CKD is lacking, and most do not account for competing risks.

Methods

To externally validate 11 existing models of kidney failure, taking the competing risk of death into account, we included patients with advanced CKD from two large cohorts: the European Quality Study (EQUAL), an ongoing European prospective, multicenter cohort study of older patients with advanced CKD, and the Swedish Renal Registry (SRR), an ongoing registry of nephrology-referred patients with CKD in Sweden. The outcome of the models was kidney failure (defined as RRT-treated ESKD). We assessed model performance with discrimination and calibration.

Results

The study included 1580 patients from EQUAL and 13,489 patients from SRR. The average c statistic over the 11 validated models was 0.74 in EQUAL and 0.80 in SRR, compared with 0.89 in previous validations. Most models with longer prediction horizons overestimated the risk of kidney failure considerably. The 5-year Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) overpredicted risk by 10%-18%. The four- and eight-variable 2-year KFRE and the 4-year Grams model showed excellent calibration and good discrimination in both cohorts.

Conclusions

Some existing models can accurately predict kidney failure in patients with advanced CKD. KFRE performed well for a shorter time frame (2 years), despite not accounting for competing events. Models predicting over a longer time frame (5 years) overestimated risk because of the competing risk of death. The Grams model, which accounts for the latter, is suitable for longer-term predictions (4 years).

### Risk prediction equations for incident chronic kidney disease… [^1131mdtT]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

In this analysis of 5 222 711 individuals in 34 multinational cohorts from 28 countries, 5-year risk prediction equations for CKD were developed and demonstrated high discrimination and variable calibration. Discrimination and calibration were similar in 9 external cohorts consisting of 2 253 540 individuals. To obtain the adjusted baseline risk for use with the primary model, we held the weighted-average coefficients constant and fit a multivariable competing risk model in the studies with follow-up for mortality and mean time between creatinine measures of less than 1 year. The adjusted subhazard was smoothed using a Weibull distribution, and the mean was estimated using weights determined by the method described above.

The prediction model then combined the mean adjusted baseline risk with the weighted-average coefficients. The Chien equation was developed from 5168 Chinese individuals who underwent baseline health examinations at the National Taiwan University Hospital16 and annual follow-up examinations that included measurements of serum creatinine concentration for assessing the outcome of reduced eGFR. During a median follow-up of 2. 2 years, 190 individuals developed CKD. The plots reflected the performance of the equations for the primary end point in the cohorts, with 9 of the 13 study populations showing a slope of observed to predicted risk between 0. 80 and 1.
25. Calibration was generally better for the eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 end point than for the lower eGFR end points, where calibration was poor in some cohorts. Calibration analysis showed that 16 out of 18 study populations had a slope between 0.

80 and 1.
25. Discrimination and calibration for the lower eGFR end points are shown in eFigures 7 and 8 and eTables 17 and 18 in the Supplement. For example, for an eGFR of less than 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2, 15 out of 18 study populations showed a slope be.

### Recent updates in kidney risk prediction modeling: novel approaches and earlier outcomes [^114qugwn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent years have witnessed the development of kidney risk prediction models which diverge from traditional model designs to incorporate novel approaches along with a focus on earlier outcomes. This review summarizes these recent advances, evaluates their pros and cons, and discusses their potential implications.

Recent Findings

Several kidney risk prediction models have recently been developed utilizing machine learning rather than traditional Cox regression. These models have demonstrated accurate prediction of kidney disease progression, often beyond that of traditional models, in both internal and external validation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a simplified kidney risk prediction model was recently developed which minimized the need for laboratory data and instead relies primarily on self-reported data. While internal testing showed good overall predictive performance, the generalizability of this model remains uncertain. Finally, there is a growing trend toward prediction of earlier kidney outcomes (e.g., incident chronic kidney disease [CKD]) and away from a sole focus on kidney failure.

Summary

Newer approaches and outcomes now being incorporated into kidney risk prediction modeling may enhance prediction and benefit a broader patient population. However, future work should address how best to implement these models into practice and assess their long-term clinical effectiveness.

### Predicting the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease: multinational, longitudinal, population based, cohort study [^114tPCV8]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To train and test a super learner strategy for risk prediction of kidney failure and mortality in people with incident moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (stage G3b to G4).

Design

Multinational, longitudinal, population based, cohort study.

Settings

Linked population health data from Canada (training and temporal testing), and Denmark and Scotland (geographical testing).

Participants

People with newly recorded chronic kidney disease at stage G3b-G4, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 15–44 mL/min/1.73 m².

Modelling

The super learner algorithm selected the best performing regression models or machine learning algorithms (learners) based on their ability to predict kidney failure and mortality with minimised cross-validated prediction error (Brier score, the lower the better). Prespecified learners included age, sex, eGFR, albuminuria, with or without diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The index of prediction accuracy, a measure of calibration and discrimination calculated from the Brier score (the higher the better) was used to compare KDpredict with the benchmark, kidney failure risk equation, which does not account for the competing risk of death, and to evaluate the performance of KDpredict mortality models.

Results

67942 Canadians, 17528 Danish, and 7740 Scottish residents with chronic kidney disease at stage G3b to G4 were included (median age 77–80 years; median eGFR 39 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Median follow-up times were five to six years in all cohorts. Rates were 0.8–1.1 per 100 person years for kidney failure and 10–12 per 100 person years for death. KDpredict was more accurate than kidney failure risk equation in prediction of kidney failure risk: five year index of prediction accuracy 27.8% (95% confidence interval 25.2% to 30.6%) versus 18.1% (15.7% to 20.4%) in Denmark and 30.5% (27.8% to 33.5%) versus 14.2% (12.0% to 16.5%) in Scotland. Predictions from kidney failure risk equation and KDpredict differed substantially, potentially leading to diverging treatment decisions. An 80-year-old man with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 100 mg/g (11 mg/mmol) would receive a five year kidney failure risk prediction of 10% from kidney failure risk equation (above the current nephrology referral threshold of 5%). The same man would receive five year risk predictions of 2% for kidney failure and 57% for mortality from KDpredict. Individual risk predictions from KDpredict with four or six variables were accurate for both outcomes. The KDpredict models retrained using older data provided accurate predictions when tested in temporally distinct, more recent data.

Conclusions

KDpredict could be incorporated into electronic medical records or accessed online to accurately predict the risks of kidney failure and death in people with moderate to severe CKD. The KDpredict learning strategy is designed to be adapted to local needs and regularly revised over time to account for changes in the underlying health system and care processes.

### Predicting progression in CKD: perspectives and precautions [^111oSSPh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Predicting outcomes to guide clinical care, decision making, and resource allocation is a challenging undertaking in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many prediction models have been developed, but few have been appropriately externally validated and even fewer have been assessed to be usable in the clinical setting. This contributes to the currently infrequent use of existing prediction models. Patients with CKD are a particularly heterogeneous group with significant biological variability, making the development of useful prediction models even more challenging. This article explores the different challenges in the development, validation, and application of prediction models in CKD. We explore the notion that newer biomarkers offer potential for enhancing existing and future prediction models and that modern technology is an opportunity to make prediction models more accessible and less cumbersome to use in clinical practice. Despite the challenges associated with their development and implementation, clinical prediction models have the potential to be a powerful tool for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers alike.

### Predicting the outcomes of chronic kidney disease in older adults [^115Vf1oK]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Beside differences in model development (super learner for KDpredict v standard Cox regressions modelling for kidney failure risk equation), KDpredict and kidney failure risk equation differed in various ways. The population that was used to develop KDpredict was older (median age 77–80 years v 69–70 years) and included people with more advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 v < 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2). These dissimilarities may account for some of the difference in performance. While both models incorporated the same core variables, KDpredict included substantially more predictors overall. This broader approach makes more efficient use of predictive information, which translates into enhanced predictive performance. This approach can result in models that perform well in the derivation sample, but less well when tested in a different population. Furthermore, the increased complexity of models such as KDpredict means that routine uptake will depend on automated computation of risk. Widespread availability of smart devices and internet connectivity may help to overcome this issue.

The KDpredict investigators cite various limitations of the kidney failure risk equation to justify the development of new and more complex models; however, some of these limitations are arguable. Firstly, although the current kidney failure risk equation does not account for competing risks, the investigators of the equation did develop an alternative model using competing risk approach that made no material difference to the original equation's performance. Secondly, the need to predict all cause mortality for people with chronic kidney disease (available with KDpredict but not with kidney failure risk equation), is debatable. Cardiovascular disease is the leading driver of mortality among adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease so these individuals typically have multiple treatments to reduce cardiovascular disease, irrespective of their absolute cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, estimating mortality risk is unlikely to significantly affect patients' clinical management, including preparing them for the possibility of end-stage renal replacement treatment.

### Investigation of end-stage kidney disease risk prediction in an ethnically diverse cohort of people with type 2 diabetes: use of kidney failure risk equation [^112xcNjA]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, it included a large sample size, along with a high event rate, from a heterogeneous ethnically diverse urban population with T2DM and CKD with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Baseline eGFR was higher than many studies to date and this is clinically relevant as KFRE utility is to identify those at high risk of progression and to refer people at high risk early to dedicated renal services. Our data were collected in a real-world setting as part of routine clinical care and at two large university hospitals where standardised laboratory methodology was used.

We acknowledge several limitations. Comparison of KFRE predictive performance was done only in people with T2DM and CKD with at least one eGFR between 15 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline and we used ESKD rather than KF as primary endpoint. The majority (86%) of the study cohort had a second eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 within 2 years of their baseline and we knowledge the limitation due to including some individuals without a second confirmatory eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in our analyses (14%). However, the baseline characteristics in this specific cohort (N = 6249) are similar to that in the whole study cohort (the proportion with primary and secondary event was slightly higher (11.4% and 17.1%, respectively) (online supplemental table S7). In addition, post hoc analyses in this specific cohort showed that the KFRE performance are comparable to that in the whole study cohort (online supplemental table S8). We also knowledge the limitation due to using the endpoints as reaching eGFR < 10 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively, rather than KF per se. However, the aim of this study was to assess the utility of using KFRE to detect people with ESKD defined as eGFR < 10 and < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In addition, it has been recently shown that the accuracy of reporting KF might not be guaranteed in either primary or secondary care data due to issues in coding and therefore failure in identifying prevalent patients with KF or erroneously identification remains problematic. Therefore, our choice was to try assessing the utility of KFRE to identify people before KF needing treatment (which tends to occur around 8–9 mL/min in UK).

### Use of the kidney failure risk equation to determine the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease in children with chronic kidney disease [^1138j9dM]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) has been shown to accurately estimate progression to kidney failure in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Use of the KFRE in children with CKD, if accurate, would help to optimize planning for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care.

Objective

To determine whether the KFRE adequately discriminates the risk of ESRD in children with CKD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included 603 children with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children study, a national multicenter observational study. Data were collected from January 1, 2005, through July 31, 2013, and analyzed from September 30, 2016, through September 8, 2017.

Exposures

The primary predictive factors were the 4-variable (age, sex, bedside Schwartz estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ratio of albumin to creatinine levels) and 8-variable (4 variables plus serum calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and albumin levels) KFREs, which provide 1-, 2-, and 5-year estimates of the risk of progression to ESRD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time to ESRD. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the association between the KFRE score and time to ESRD. C statistics were used to discriminate ESRD risk by the KFRE, with a value of greater than 0.80 indicating strong discrimination.

Results

Of the 603 children included in the study, 378 were boys (62.7%) and 225 were girls (37.3%); median age at study entry was 12 years (interquartile range, 8–15 years). Median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 44 mL/min/1.73 m2. Four hundred fifty-seven participants (75.8%) had a nonglomerular cause of CKD. Median observation time was 3.8 years (interquartile range, 1.7–6.2 years); 144 (23.9%) developed ESRD within 5 years of enrollment. The 4-variable KFRE scores discriminated risk of ESRD, with C statistics of 0.90, 0.86, and 0.81 for the 1-, 2-, and 5-year risk scores, respectively. Results were similar using the 8-variable equation.

Conclusions and Relevance

The KFRE is a simple tool that provides excellent discrimination of the risk of ESRD. Results suggest that the KFRE could be incorporated into the clinical care of children with CKD to aid in anticipatory guidance, timing of referral for transplant evaluation, and planning for dialysis access.

### Performance and pitfalls of the tools for measuring glomerular filtration rate to guide chronic kidney disease diagnosis and assessment [^115s9Svv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnosis, classification and risk stratification for chronic kidney disease (CKD) allow for early recognition and delivering optimal care. Creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR) and the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) are important tools to achieve this, but understanding their limitations is important for optimal implementation. When accurate GFR is required (eg, chemotherapy dosing), GFR is measured using an exogenous filtration marker. In routine clinical practice, in contrast, estimated GFR (eGFR) from serum creatinine (SCr), calculated using the enzymatic method ± UACR, is recommended. Limitations of SCr include non-GFR determinants such as muscle mass, diet and tubular handling. An alternative or additional endogenous filtration marker is cystatin C, which can be used alongside SCr for confirmatory testing of CKD. However, its role in the UK is more limited due to concerns regarding false positive results. The recommended creatinine-based eGFR equation in the UK is the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration 2009 equation. This was recently updated to a race-neutral 2021 version and demonstrated reduced bias in people of Black ethnicity, but has not been validated in the UK. Limitations are extremes of age, inaccuracy at greater GFRs and reduced generalisability to under-represented ethnicity groups. The KFRE (based on age, sex, SCr and UACR) has recently been developed to help determine 2-year and 5-year risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. It has been validated in over 30 countries and provides meaningful quantitative information to patients. However, supporting evidence for their performance in ethnic minority groups and kidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis remains modest. In conclusion, early identification, risk stratification of kidney disease and timely intervention are important to impact kidney disease progression. However, clinician awareness of the limitations and variability of creatinine, cystatin C and the eGFR equations, is key to appropriate interpretation of results.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^114dRf9B]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Statement of principal findings

Using electronic health records linked with national renal registry, we found that the recalibrated KFRE (Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA equation) had better performance than existing KFRE equations in terms of having a lower Brier score, less bias and improved precision for predicting ESKD in multi-ethnic patients visiting the primary care clinics. The overall predictive capability of the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA for ESKD was significantly higher than using eGFR alone. In addition, 5-year KFRE thresholds ranging 10–16% for nephrologist referral and 2-year KFRE risk threshold at 45% for dialysis planning resulted in high referral efficiency, and substantially improved reclassification of ESKD risks relative to eGFR thresholds of 20, 30, 40 and 45 mL/min/1.73m 2. Thus, automated referrals using KFRE thresholds warrant consideration in clinical practice for patients with CKD.

### Towards the best kidney failure prediction tool: a systematic review and selection aid [^111aCZNT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prediction tools that identify chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a high risk of developing kidney failure have the potential for great clinical value, but limited uptake. The aim of the current study is to systematically review all available models predicting kidney failure in CKD patients, organize empirical evidence on their validity and ultimately provide guidance in the interpretation and uptake of these tools.

Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant articles. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were sequentially screened for inclusion by two independent researchers. Data on study design, model development and performance were extracted. The risk of bias and clinical usefulness were assessed and combined in order to provide recommendations on which models to use.

Results

Of 2183 screened studies, a total of 42 studies were included in the current review. Most studies showed high discriminatory capacity and the included predictors had large overlap. Overall, the risk of bias was high. Slightly less than half the studies (48%) presented enough detail for the use of their prediction tool in practice and few models were externally validated.

Conclusions

The current systematic review may be used as a tool to select the most appropriate and robust prognostic model for various settings. Although some models showed great potential, many lacked clinical relevance due to being developed in a prevalent patient population with a wide range of disease severity. Future research efforts should focus on external validation and impact assessment in clinically relevant patient populations.

### Estimating tubular damage for predicting progression of chronic kidney disease-what are the implications for clinical practice and public health? [^112KQBSw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

In the last decade, several new urinary biomarkers have been put forward as markers of renal tubular damage or dysfunction, and some of them have shown promise as early identifiers of acute kidney injury, which is an important area of unmet clinical need. The relevance of the tubular damage biomarkers in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear and the identification of patients at the highest risk of rapid CKD progression has been a challenge in clinical practice. In many CKD patients, kidney function remains relatively stable for years, whereas for others, kidney function declines rapidly, ultimately leading to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular complications.

Current risk equations for end-stage renal disease are mostly based on the established kidney disease markers estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, and tubular dysfunction appears to be a separate aspect of kidney pathology not fully reflected by these biomarkers. Indeed, it has been suggested that there exists a group of patients with isolated tubular damage but with normal eGFR and albuminuria, who may have a worse prognosis for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Several tubular damage biomarkers have been reported as risk markers for CKD progression in the last decades; however in general, previous results on whether these markers add clinically valuable information have been conflicting and inconsistent. None of the proposed tubular damage biomarker-based risk prediction algorithms has so far reached broad clinical application. With the projected future increase in CKD burden combined with the emerging data on several new drugs (e.g. sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) that may slow the progression of CKD, improved risk prediction incorporating aspects of tubular damage may prove to be even more important in the future.

### Multinational assessment of accuracy of equations for predicting risk of kidney failure: a meta-analysis [^116fEg8X]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Identifying patients at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may facilitate more optimal nephrology care. Kidney failure risk equations, including such factors as age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and calcium and phosphate concentrations, were previously developed and validated in 2 Canadian cohorts. Validation in other regions and in CKD populations not under the care of a nephrologist is needed.

Objective

To evaluate the accuracy of the risk equations across different geographic regions and patient populations through individual participant data meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Thirty-one cohorts, including 721,357 participants with CKD stages 3 to 5 in more than 30 countries spanning 4 continents, were studied. These cohorts collected data from 1982 through 2014.

Study Selection

Cohorts participating in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with data on end-stage renal disease.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were obtained and statistical analyses were performed between July 2012 and June 2015. Using the risk factors from the original risk equations, cohort-specific hazard ratios were estimated and combined using random-effects meta-analysis to form new pooled kidney failure risk equations. Original and pooled kidney failure risk equation performance was compared, and the need for regional calibration factors was assessed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant).

Results

During a median follow-up of 4 years of 721,357 participants with CKD, 23,829 cases kidney failure were observed. The original risk equations achieved excellent discrimination (ability to differentiate those who developed kidney failure from those who did not) across all cohorts (overall C statistic, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89–0.92 at 2 years; C statistic at 5 years, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86–0.90); discrimination in subgroups by age, race, and diabetes status was similar. There was no improvement with the pooled equations. Calibration (the difference between observed and predicted risk) was adequate in North American cohorts, but the original risk equations overestimated risk in some non-North American cohorts. Addition of a calibration factor that lowered the baseline risk by 32.9% at 2 years and 16.5% at 5 years improved the calibration in 12 of 15 and 10 of 13 non-North American cohorts at 2 and 5 years, respectively (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Kidney failure risk equations developed in a Canadian population showed high discrimination and adequate calibration when validated in 31 multinational cohorts. However, in some regions the addition of a calibration factor may be necessary.

### Contemporary risk prediction models in chronic kidney disease: when less is more [^113Mnd4z]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinicians have an ever-increasing number of prediction tools at their disposal for estimating the risk of kidney failure in their patients. This review aims to summarize contemporary evidence for chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk prediction models across the spectrum of kidney function, and explore nuances in the interpretation of risk estimates.

Recent Findings

A European study using predominantly laboratory data has extended kidney failure prediction to patients with more preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate. For older patients with advanced CKD, prediction tools that censor for death (such as the Kidney Failure Risk Equation) overestimate the risk of kidney failure, especially over time horizons longer than 2 years. This problem can be addressed by accounting for the competing risk of death, as shown in well designed validation studies. The clinical utility of kidney failure risk prediction tools is being increasingly tested at a population level to inform policy and referral guidelines.

Summary

There is welcome trend to validate existing prediction tools in diverse clinical settings and identify their role in clinical practice. Clinicians should be cognizant of overestimating kidney failure risk in older patients with advanced CKD due to the competing risk of death. For moderate CKD and for short-term predictions, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation remains the most widely validated prediction tool.

RISK ASSESSMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CKD

A summary of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommendation statements and practice points on the risk assessment of people with CKD is presented in Table 2.

Table 2:
Summary of recommendation statements and practice points relevant to risk assessment in people with CKD in the 2024 KDIGO Guideline and differences from the 2012 KDIGO Guideline.

Monitoring of CKD

Monitoring eGFR and albuminuria in both adults and children with CKD is important not only to update staging for prognosis but also to guide clinical decisions. Because the KDIGO CKD staging classification based on eGFR and albuminuria is based on future kidney failure risk, their recommendation is to monitor those at higher risk of progression more frequently (e.g. they suggest monitoring kidney function and albuminuria once annually to people with CKD G1A2, but thrice annually to people with CKD G1A3, and consider even increasing this depending on the underlying aetiology of CKD). While the recommendation makes sense, the challenge lies in its implementation. European healthcare systems, as in other parts of the world, are affected by a severe under-recognition of CKD. While creatinine is measured in healthcare for many indications (and in most European healthcare systems eGFR is automatically reported), albuminuria screening and monitoring is still the bottleneck. For example, in a North European evaluation of processes of CKD care, only about a third of patients with incident CKD stages 3–5 received albuminuria monitoring within the following 18 months. Strategies to improve monitoring rates could involve educational campaigns to primary care and general physicians as well as individuals at high risk of CKD. Indeed, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides a list of at-risk individuals (Table 3). Economic incentives have been successfully shown in the UK to improve monitoring rates. In settings with less access to laboratory services, utilisation of novel and accurate POCT tools could also be potentially useful.

### A validation study of the kidney failure risk equation in advanced chronic kidney disease according to disease aetiology with evaluation of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility [^111iYQqn]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) predicts the 2- and 5-year risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3a-5. Its predictive performance in advanced CKD and in specific disease aetiologies requires further exploration. This study validates the 4- and 8-variable KFREs in an advanced CKD population in the United Kingdom by evaluating discrimination, calibration and clinical utility.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the Salford Kidney Study who were referred to the Advanced Kidney Care Service (AKCS) clinic at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust between 2011 and 2018 were included. The 4- and 8-variable KFREs were calculated on the first AKCS visit and the observed events of ESRD (dialysis or pre-emptive transplantation) within 2- and 5-years were the primary outcome. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots were used to evaluate discrimination and calibration respectively in the whole cohort and in specific disease aetiologies: diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and other diseases. Clinical utility was assessed with decision curve analyses, comparing the net benefit of using the KFREs against estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) cut-offs of < 20ml/min/1.73m 2 and < 15ml/min/1.73m 2 to guide further treatment.

Results

A total of 743 patients comprised the 2-year analysis and 613 patients were in the 5-year analysis. Discrimination was good in the whole cohort: the 4-variable KFRE had an AUC of 0.796 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.762–0.831) for predicting ESRD at 2-years and 0.773 (95% CI 0.736–0.810) at 5-years, and there was good-to-excellent discrimination across disease aetiologies. Calibration plots revealed underestimation of risk at 2-years and overestimation of risk at 5-years, especially in high-risk patients. There was, however, underestimation of risk in patients with ADPKD for all KFRE calculations. The predictive accuracy was similar between the 4- and 8-variable KFREs. Finally, compared to eGFR-based thresholds, the KFRE was the optimal tool to guide further care based on decision curve analyses.

Conclusions

The 4- and 8-variable KFREs demonstrate adequate discrimination and calibration for predicting ESRD in an advanced CKD population and, importantly, can provide better clinical utility than using an eGFR-based strategy to inform decision-making.

Of 23,063 adults with CKD, 4,838 were included in the analysis (Additional File 1: Figure S3). The median five-year KFRE was 0.3% (Table 1).

The highest KFRE values were found amongst males, adults aged 40–50 years, people with diabetes, and people living in the most deprived areas (Table 4).

### Machine learning models to predict end-stage kidney disease in chronic kidney disease stage 4 [^1114fLMH]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem that affects more than 850 million individuals worldwide. In the United States, approximately 15% of the population, or 37 million people, suffer from CKD and more than 130,000 CKD patients were newly diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In advanced CKD, including CKD stage 4, care goals focus on slowing CKD progression and preparing for renal replacement therapy (RRT), such as dialysis modality selection, vascular access placement, and pre-emptive transplantation. According to the 2019 United States Renal Data System (USRDS), approximately 30% of incident ESKD patients did not receive nephrology care prior to being diagnosed with ESKD which results in increased unplanned dialysis and early mortality after dialysis initiation. Clinical decisions for CKD stage 4 are challenging in current practice due to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases and the variability of disease progression rates. Accurate prediction of the risk of kidney failure could lead to better overall CKD stage 4 management by improving individual advanced CKD care outcomes through information sharing for patients' decision-making and matching therapy risks or side effects to the risk of disease progression. In addition, reliable prediction models enhance the efficacy of the health system by optimizing resource allocation and matching individual risk.

The development of clinical medicine's digitization and the widespread availability of electronic health records (EHR) have generated large-scale real-world clinical data which can be used for developing clinical decision systems. Machine learning (ML) represents more sophisticated mathematical functions than traditional statistics and typically yields superior performance when predicting outcomes determined by a large number of variables with nonlinear and complex interactions. To date, only a few studies have developed ML prediction models for CKD progression to kidney failure, and the results have been contradictory. Whether ML predicts CKD progression better than traditional statistical analysis remains unclear.

In this study, we aimed to determine if ML models could be used to predict the progression to ESKD in patients with CKD stage 4. We hypothesized that incorporating several baseline clinical parameters in ML models would enable accurate identification of patients at high risk of developing ESKD within three years after CKD stage 4 diagnosis.

Risk scores

A significant innovation of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline refers to the introduction of risk scores for personalization of care. While the traditional KDIGO staging heat map illustrates risks at a population level, the true individual risk of a given patient is determined not only by his/her eGFR or albuminuria, but also the underlying aetiology of CKD, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions (especially cardiovascular disease) and other factors, including lifestyle, socioeconomic status, nutritional status and intercurrent events. Individual risk prediction in nephrology using accurate and externally validated risk equations have the potential to help inform key clinical decisions and improve the patient–healthcare provider dialogue.

We reflect that the panorama of risk scores in nephrology is changing rapidly. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline mentions four externally validated risk scores for kidney failure, but since the publication of the guidelines new ones have emerged (Table 3). Academic discussions may revolve around small improvements in prediction of one score versus another. From a clinical point of view all of them tend to offer excellent precision, and differences in performance must be evaluated within the context of the alternative, which frequently is not to use any. After all, features like old age, hypertension, low eGFR and albuminuria, which are common to all risk scores, largely capture the patient's future kidney risks. Amongst available validated equations, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) has so far had the largest penetration in routine care: many North American health systems and the National Health Service in the UK have integrated KFRE reporting in electronic medical records. However, we are not aware of these tools been used much in the routine care practice of other European countries yet, and we hope that this guideline statement contributes to a paradigm change.

### Investigation of end-stage kidney disease risk prediction in an ethnically diverse cohort of people with type 2 diabetes: use of kidney failure risk equation [^115UFQcF]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The four variable kidney failure (KF) risk equation (KFRE) is recommended to estimate KF risk (ie, need for dialysis or kidney transplantation). Earlier referral to clinical kidney services for people with high-risk of kidney failure can ensure appropriate care, education and support are in place pre-emptively. There are limited data on investigating the performance of KFRE in estimating risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary ESKD endpoint event was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and secondary endpoint eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Research Design and Methods

We studied 7296 people (30% women, 41% African-Caribbean, 45% Caucasian) with T2DM and CKD (eGFR median (range) 48 (15–59) mL/min/1.73 m 2) were included at two hospitals in London (median follow-up 10.2 years). Time to ESKD event was the endpoint and Concordance index (C-index) was used to assess KFRE's discrimination of those experiencing ESKD from those who did not. Mean (integrated calibration index (ICI)) and 90th percentile (E90) of the difference between observed and predicted risks were used as calibration metrics.

Results

Of the cohort 746 (10.2%) reached ESKD primary event (135 (1.9%) and 339 (4.5%) over 2 and 5 years, respectively). Similarly, 1130 (15.5%) reached the secondary endpoint (270 (3.7%) and 547 (7.5%) over 2 and 5 years, respectively). The C-index for the primary endpoint was 0.842 (95% CI 0.836 to 0.848) and 0.816 (95% CI 0.812 to 0.820) for 2 and 5 years, respectively. KFRE 'under-predicted' ESKD risk overall and by ethnic group. Likewise, the C-index for secondary endpoint was 0.843 (0.839–0.847) and 0.801 (0.798–0.804) for 2 and 5 years, respectively. KFRE performance analysis performed more optimally with the primary endpoint with 50% enhancement of the calibration metrics than with the secondary endpoint. KFRE recalibration improved ICI by 50% and E90 by more than 78%.

Conclusions

Although derived for predicting KF, KFRE also demonstrated good discrimination for ESKD outcome. Further studies are needed to identify variables/biomarkers that may improve KFRE's performance/calibration and to aid the development of other predictive models to enable early identification of people at risk of advanced stages of CKD prior to onset of KF.

### Implementing the European renal best practice guidelines suggests that prediction equations work well to differentiate risk of end-stage renal disease vs. death in older patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate [^116bqbHW]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent European guidelines suggest using the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) and mortality risk equation for kidney disease (MREK) to guide decisions on whether elderly patients with chronic kidney disease should be referred early for dialysis preparation. However, the concurrent use of the two risk equations has not been validated. To do so we evaluated 1,188 individuals over five years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 45ml/min/1.73m² and age over 65 years from the Norwegian population based HUNT study. Forty-two patients started renal replacement therapy and 462 died as their first clinical event. The KFRE was well calibrated (mean risk estimate 4.9% vs observed 3.5%) with high diagnostic accuracy (C-statistics 0.93). The MREK underestimated death risk in those with lower risk (mean risk estimate 30.1% vs observed 38.9%) and had moderate diagnostic accuracy (C-statistics 0.71). Only 31 individuals had estimated end stage kidney disease (ESRD) risk greater than death risk, and most experienced ESRD before death. Only two of 598 patients over 80 years old, and ten of 1,063 with eGFR 25–45ml/min/1.73m 2 at baseline experienced ESRD. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that for risk adverse patients, deferring ESRD preparation may be appropriate until predicted ESRD risk exceeds predicted death risk. For those preferring a more aggressive approach, referral when eGFR is under 25 ml/min/1.73m 2 may be beneficial if age remains under 80 years. Thus, the risk of ESRD is low compared to the risk of death in many older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or worse, and combination of predicted ESRD and death risks, eGFR levels, age, and the patient's valuations of harm and benefit can be helpful for deciding when to start dialysis preparations.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^116EhGuA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results showed that the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA equation is an excellent predictive tool and performed better in terms of having a lower Brier score, less bias and improved precision than existing KFRE for identifying patients with CKD at risk for progression to ESKD in a primary care setting in SEA. Our findings suggest that implementation of the equation using 5-year thresholds > 10–16% to guide dialysis planning and 2-year threshold > 45% to guide nephrologist referral would facilitate more efficient and accurate risk stratification of patients at high risk of ESKD. Future studies are warranted to validate our findings, evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of a CKD model of care that integrates EHR and the KFRE in primary care settings serving Asians as well as globally.

### A predictive model for progression of CKD to kidney failure based on routine laboratory tests [^116tDxFk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Stratification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at risk for progressing to kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KFRT) is important for clinical decision-making and trial enrollment.

Study Design

Four independent prospective observational cohort studies.

Setting & Participants

The development cohort comprised 4,915 CKD patients, and 3 independent validation cohorts comprised a total of 3,063. Patients were observed for approximately 5 years.

Exposure

22 demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory variables commonly assessed in CKD patients.

Outcome

Progression to KFRT.

Analytical Approach

A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional hazards model was fit to select laboratory variables that best identified patients at high risk for KFRT. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed and compared against the 4-variable Tangri (T4) risk equation both in a resampling approach within the development cohort and in the validation cohorts using cause-specific concordance (C) statistics, net reclassification improvement, and calibration graphs.

Results

The newly derived 6-variable risk score (Z6) included serum creatinine, albumin, cystatin C, and urea, as well as hemoglobin and the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. In the the resampling approach, Z6 achieved a median C statistic of 0.909 (95% CI, 0.868–0.937) at 2 years after the baseline visit, whereas the T4 achieved a median C statistic of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.799–0.915). In the 3 independent validation cohorts, the Z6C statistics were 0.894, 0.921, and 0.891, whereas the T4C statistics were 0.882, 0.913, and 0.862.

Limitations

The Z6 was both derived and tested only in White European cohorts.

Conclusions

A new risk equation based on 6 routinely available laboratory tests facilitates identification of patients with CKD who are at high risk of progressing to KFRT.

### Validation of the kidney failure risk equation for end-stage kidney disease in southeast Asia [^114NqpjV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Stratified and sensitivity analyses

KFRE discrimination remained excellent across all subgroups defined by 1) age (40–75 vs. > 75 years), 2) gender, 3) ethnicity (Chinese, Malays, and Indians), 4) type 2 diabetes mellitus status, and 5) CKD stages at both 5- and 2-year risks. At 5 years, the AUC ranged from 0.82 to 0.96 in the subgroups and at 2 years, the AUC ranged from 0.83 to 0.98 in the subgroups (Additional file 9). Of note, at 5 years, the 95% CI of Malays and Chinese were comparable; and that of Indians, maybe due to smaller sample sizes, was much wider than Chinese and Malays (Additional file 9).

A total of 408 and 236 ESKD events started dialysis and received kidney transplantation at 5-year and 2-year, respectively. Limiting to these events as outcomes, the discrimination of the Recalibrated Pooled KFRE SEA was largely the same as the main analyses: the AUC was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92–0.94) at 5-year and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.96) at 2-year risk of ESKD onset.

A total of 3241 and 1927 deaths occurred during the 5-year and 2-year follow-ups, respectively. The competing risk and non-competing risk models at 5 years had similar HRs and considerate overlaping 95% CIs (242 [60.4–972] vs. 227 [56.5–909]), suggesting the effect of competing mortality risks is unlikely to affect the ESKD prediction.

### Investigation of end-stage kidney disease risk prediction in an ethnically diverse cohort of people with type 2 diabetes: use of kidney failure risk equation [^113d4Bgs]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

A recent large studyof 59 cohorts has addressed some of the questions our study raised. The study aimed to validate the KFRE original equation 2 using the CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine equation for estimating GFR, as opposed to the CKD-EPI 2009 formula 3 used in the initial KFRE and found that CKD-EPI 2021 did not improve KFRE prediction performance, nor does additional variables and/or accounting for the competing risk of death. Additionally, the study highlighted heterogeneity in prediction performance across cohorts, identifying eight that substantially overpredicted 2-year risk and six that underpredicted it out of 58 cohorts. The 5-year risk on the other hand was overpredicted by three of 20 cohorts, but no under prediction was noted. The study has also shown substantial heterogeneity across subgroups. For example, underprediction of the 2-year risk was found in five out of eight cohorts in people with higher levels of eGFR (45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2), and over-prediction among those age 65+, in four cohorts out of eight. These two examples were among other 10 subgroups where large deviation in calibration was noted.

### Towards the best kidney failure prediction tool: a systematic review and selection aid [^112SXoho]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance proved to be largely lacking for many of the included models in the current review. Specifically, models for general CKD patients were often developed on prevalent patients with a wide range of disease severity and did not specify a specific time point when the model should be used. Prediction of renal failure can be extremely accurate when using a population with GFRs ranging from 10 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. However, in practice, such tools would probably be employed for a more homogeneous group of patients in which it is clinically relevant to discuss prognosis. The predictive capacities of the model would be lower in such a population. This is exemplified in the KFRE validation performed by Peeters et al. where the area under the curve of the four-variable KFRE dramatically decreased from 0.88 in the whole population (CKD Stages 3–5) to 0.71 in the more relevant population of CKD Stage 4 patients. Another factor limiting usability and interpretability is that the number of studies did not define the prediction time frame. Finally, the definition of outcome differs between studies. The use of composite endpoints is particularly problematic, as it limits the value of the model for clinicians, as each separate endpoint requires different interventions. In conclusion, an ideal model is developed for one clearly defined clinically meaningful and objective endpoint in a population for which prediction is clinically relevant. Few models included in this review met these recommendations and this lack of clinical relevance could be a large contributor to the slow uptake seen in practice.

### Bias and accuracy of glomerular filtration rate estimating equations… [^113r1nZ1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A positive value of bias indicates that the eGFR tends to underestimate actual kidney function, while a negative bias value suggests an overestimation by eGFR. Non-Black participants included participants who identified as Asian, Hispanic, White, and multiracial. NA indicates not applicable. Question How do glomerular filtration rate estimating equations vary in bias and accuracy across various patient populations, and what is the association of biomarkers with the performance of these equations. Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies with a combined 44 721 patients, substantial variability was observed in GFR estimation equations. Race-based equations often overestimated GFR in Black individuals whereas serum cystatin C–based GFR estimating equations demonstrated minimal bias.

Meaning These findings suggest that creatinine-based equations are limited in their ability to estimate kidney function and underscore the need for alternative approaches such as cystatin C–based equations, as well as addressing social determinants of health and systemic racism. Current eGFR equations are integral for determining the burden of kidney disease at the population and patient level; however, they are limited by poor individual-level predictions, 4, 5 imprecise population predictions for key CKD-related conditions, more pronounced bias at GFR levels greater than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, and need for race correction with serum creatinine–based GFR estimating equations for Black individuals. 7–10. This review raises 2 critically important points previously overlooked by most authors addressing these issues.

First, while the equations are generally useful for the assessment of kidney disease across the population, their accuracy for clinical decision-making in individual patients remains disappointing. For example, the CKD-EPI equations consistently reported higher accuracies, except for patients with diabetes and severe obesity. 24, 30 This finding suggests that CKD-EPI equation may not perform well in these patients. Second, our findings suggest that the bias and inaccuracy in serum creatinine–based eGFR equations is of similar or larger magnitude than any differences related to inclusion or noninclusion of a designated race term. Miller et al33 and Sehgal et al34 argued that uncertainty in eGFR is much larger than the race adjustment term and that eGFR, whether adjusted for race or not, provides only a rough measure of kidney function.
