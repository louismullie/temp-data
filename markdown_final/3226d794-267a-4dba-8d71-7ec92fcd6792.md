## Question

Can metformin be prescribed if ALT is elevated to 54?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metformin can be prescribed when ALT is 54 U/L and how to reason through that decision safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret ALT 54 U/L relative to the laboratory's upper limit of normal and whether this represents true hepatic impairment. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies of a mild ALT elevation and whether they alter metformin's risk-benefit profile. Next, I will review FDA labeling around "hepatic impairment" and its practical applicability. After that, I need to examine observational and meta-analytic evidence on metformin safety and outcomes in chronic liver disease. I will then assess lactic acidosis risk factors and thresholds, including renal function considerations. I should also review rare hepatotoxicity case reports to avoid missing idiosyncratic injury. Finally, I will synthesize a decision and monitoring plan tailored to ALT 54 U/L, including documentation and patient counseling.

> Let me first confirm what ALT 54 U/L means in clinical context; wait, I initially thought 54 is "mildly elevated" above a 40 U/L upper limit, but I should double-check lab variability because the ULN for ALT can vary two-fold across institutions, roughly 30–60 U/L, which means ALT 54 U/L could actually be within normal limits depending on the laboratory, and even when slightly above ULN, this degree of elevation is still well below the 2–3× ULN threshold typically considered clinically significant for hepatocellular injury severity stratification [^112nyEMD] [^114T78sS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; ALT alone does not define hepatic impairment, so I need to check for evidence of true hepatic dysfunction or decompensation by assessing bilirubin, INR, albumin, platelet count, and clinical signs such as ascites or encephalopathy, because isolated mild ALT elevation without synthetic dysfunction rarely constitutes "hepatic impairment" in a way that would materially increase metformin risk on its own [^112nyEMD] [^112migWo].

> Next, I will consider the most common causes of a mild ALT elevation; let me think about NAFLD and metabolic syndrome, which frequently accompany type 2 diabetes and often present with mildly elevated transaminases, and I should verify whether metformin influences ALT in this setting — indeed, in the Diabetes Prevention Program, ALT values were modestly lower with metformin and this effect appeared mediated by weight loss, suggesting potential improvement in metabolic liver injury rather than harm, though the effect size is modest and not a license to ignore other causes of liver disease [^113cCyXQ] [^notfound].

> I need to check what FDA labeling actually says; the metformin label states use is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment due to postmarketing cases of lactic acidosis, and several metformin-containing product labels advise avoiding use in chronic liver disease regardless of severity, but "hepatic impairment" is not operationally defined, which makes it crucial to distinguish compensated chronic liver disease with preserved synthetic function from acute liver failure or decompensation when applying labels to real patients with only a mild ALT bump [^112migWo] [^112DeFNe] [^116Y459j] [^117KDfGa] [^111eB1go].

> Wait, let me verify whether real-world data align with the label's caution; multiple observational cohorts and a recent meta-analysis in compensated cirrhosis show that metformin use is associated with lower all-cause mortality without clear evidence of increased hepatic decompensation, supporting safety and potential benefit in compensated disease, although confounding by indication cannot be fully excluded and randomized trials are lacking, so clinical judgment remains essential [^114ruWAL] [^112dAGbJ] [^117McX7o].

> I should also examine combination strategies in cirrhosis because they may influence outcomes; interestingly, dual therapy with metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with lower mortality, decompensation, and HCC compared with metformin alone in large real-world datasets, which reinforces that in compensated liver disease, metformin is often part of a beneficial metabolic regimen rather than a clear hepatic risk, although this does not override label cautions in decompensation or acute hepatic failure [^117SPQA5] [^113rhThc].

> Now, I will assess lactic acidosis risk because that is the primary safety concern the labels emphasize; the absolute risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is very low in contemporary analyses, with large meta-analyses finding no excess risk versus comparators, but the risk increases substantially with renal failure, hypoxia, sepsis, hemodynamic instability, alcohol excess, and advanced age, and I need to ensure renal function thresholds are respected and that the patient is counseled to pause metformin during acute illnesses that precipitate hypoxia or renal decline [^112TWKig] [^112DeFNe] [^115Pd2K2] [^112migWo].

> Let me double-check the operational thresholds and rescue strategies; initiation is contraindicated if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and generally discouraged 30–45 unless benefits outweigh risks, and in severe metformin toxicity or MALA, EXTRIP recommends early consideration of hemodialysis at high lactate and low pH thresholds or if standard therapy fails, which underscores that the dominant modulator of risk is renal/physiologic stress rather than a mild isolated ALT elevation [^115Pd2K2] [^11464kH9] [^113EN22s] [^111BymC8] [^116QtRBA].

> But wait, what if the ALT elevation heralds drug-induced liver injury from metformin itself; I should review hepatotoxicity case reports — there are rare idiosyncratic injuries with marked transaminase elevations and cholestatic patterns that resolve after withdrawal, sometimes with positive rechallenge, which means I must monitor for disproportionate rises, jaundice, or cholestasis if symptoms emerge, yet these patterns are very different from an asymptomatic ALT of 54 U/L with normal bilirubin and INR [^111aKhWt] [^114vvBUr] [^113Zce25].

> I should synthesize a risk-benefit conclusion for ALT 54 U/L; if other liver tests are normal, there is no clinical decompensation, and renal function is adequate, the balance of evidence favors that metformin is appropriate and may even confer hepatic and cardiometabolic benefit in the common scenario of metabolic liver disease, whereas the FDA label's "not recommended in hepatic impairment" should be operationalized as avoiding use in acute liver failure, severe decompensation, or when bilirubin and INR indicate synthetic dysfunction rather than in isolated mild ALT elevation alone [^112nyEMD] [^112migWo] [^114ruWAL] [^112TWKig].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations and monitoring; ensure eGFR is ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m² for routine initiation, reassess eGFR at least annually and more often if at risk, counsel patients to pause metformin during acute illnesses causing hypoxia, sepsis, or dehydration, and follow label guidance around iodinated contrast even though meta-analysis suggests no increased CI-AKI or lactic acidosis with continuation, because adherence to labeling remains prudent until universally harmonized recommendations exist [^11464kH9] [^112DeFNe] [^115FUBrM].

> Next, I should review adjunct safety items I must not miss; metformin is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency over time, so I will plan periodic B12 monitoring and supplementation when indicated, and I will document that mild, isolated ALT elevation does not equal hepatic impairment, that benefits outweigh theoretical risks here, and that I will re-evaluate promptly if ALT rises rapidly or if bilirubin, INR, or clinical status worsens, at which point I would hold metformin and reassess [^112F66uZ] [^1129FKdH].

> Final decision and plan: Yes, metformin can generally be prescribed when ALT is 54 U/L provided bilirubin, INR, and albumin are normal, there is no decompensated cirrhosis or acute hepatitis, and eGFR is adequate; I will start or continue metformin, monitor liver tests and renal function, educate on lactic acidosis sick-day rules, and stop metformin if there is evidence of acute liver failure, decompensation, or significant renal decline, recognizing that this approach aligns both with outcome data in compensated disease and with the spirit of label cautions applied to true hepatic impairment, not to isolated minor ALT abnormalities [^112migWo] [^114ruWAL] [^112TWKig] [^11464kH9].

Yes, **metformin can be initiated** in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L [^112nyEMD] if there is no evidence of acute or advanced liver disease, as this is only a mild elevation and not a contraindication [^112migWo]. Metformin is **not intrinsically hepatotoxic** [^114vvBUr] and may lower ALT over time through weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity [^113cCyXQ]. Confirm the cause of the elevation, assess hepatic impairment [^112migWo], and **monitor liver enzymes and renal function** during therapy.

---

## Clinical significance of ALT 54 U/L

An ALT of 54 U/L is a **mild elevation** and not a contraindication to metformin [^112migWo]. ALT reference ranges vary by laboratory and population, with the ULN typically 30–60 U/L [^112nyEMD]; thus, 54 U/L is only slightly above the ULN. Mild ALT elevations are common in T2DM and often reflect NAFLD rather than acute or advanced liver disease.

---

## Metformin and hepatic impairment

Metformin is not intrinsically hepatotoxic [^114vvBUr]; although rare hepatotoxicity has been reported [^111aKhWt], it is generally safe in mild chronic liver disease [^114ruWAL]. The main concern is **lactic acidosis**, which is rare [^112TWKig] but more likely with significant hepatic impairment due to reduced lactate clearance [^112migWo]. Mild ALT elevations alone do not indicate significant hepatic impairment [^112nyEMD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support metformin as **first-line therapy** in T2DM, including patients with mild ALT elevations [^117H2PAq], provided there is no significant hepatic impairment [^112migWo]. Metformin is not recommended in patients with **significant hepatic impairment** due to lactic acidosis risk [^112migWo]. A mild ALT elevation, in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment, is not a contraindication.

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

Before starting metformin in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L, consider the following:

- **Confirm the cause**: Evaluate for NAFLD, alcohol use, medications, or other causes of mild ALT elevation [^114NpD4s].

- **Assess hepatic impairment**: Check bilirubin, INR, albumin, and clinical signs of liver dysfunction [^112migWo].

- **Monitor liver enzymes**: Recheck ALT and AST within 3 months of initiation and periodically thereafter.

- **Monitor renal function**: Obtain baseline eGFR and monitor at least annually [^115Pd2K2], as renal impairment increases lactic acidosis risk [^11464kH9].

- **Educate patients**: Advise on symptoms of lactic acidosis [^112migWo] (e.g. malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress) and when to seek care [^111dLkM2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting metformin use in mild ALT elevation

Evidence supports metformin use in patients with mild ALT elevations, including those with NAFLD or mild chronic liver disease [^114ruWAL]. Metformin may lower ALT over time, likely through weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity [^113cCyXQ]. Metformin-associated **lactic acidosis is rare** [^116Nv2gb], and mild ALT elevations alone do not significantly increase this risk [^112migWo].

---

## Circumstances requiring caution or contraindication

Metformin should be avoided or used with caution in the following circumstances:

- **Significant hepatic impairment**: Elevated bilirubin, INR, or clinical signs of liver dysfunction [^112migWo].

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112migWo].

- **Acute illness or hypoxia**: Conditions increasing lactic acidosis risk (e.g. sepsis, acute heart failure) [^111xJty6].

- **Alcohol abuse**: Excessive alcohol intake increases lactic acidosis risk [^114yv39Q].

## Summary table: metformin use in patients with elevated ALT

| **ALT level** | **Clinical significance** | **Metformin use** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild elevation (ALT 54 U/L) [^112nyEMD] | Common in T2DM; often NAFLD [^114NpD4s] | Recommended if no hepatic impairment [^112migWo] | Monitor ALT, renal function |
| Moderate elevation (ALT 2–3× ULN) | Possible liver disease [^114NpD4s] | Use with caution; assess hepatic function [^112migWo] | Frequent monitoring [^114T78sS] |
| Severe elevation (ALT > 3× ULN) | Significant liver disease | Contraindicated | Alternative therapy |

---

Metformin can be initiated in a patient with an ALT of 54 U/L if there is **no significant hepatic impairment** [^112migWo]. Mild ALT elevations are common in T2DM and do not contraindicate metformin. Confirm the cause of the elevation, assess hepatic function, and monitor liver enzymes and renal function during therapy.

### Effects of metformin and weight loss on serum alanine aminotransferase activity in the Diabetes Prevention Program [^113cCyXQ]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. We investigated whether metformin or changes in metabolic measurements, such as weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or fasting insulin (FI), improved serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity as a marker for NAFLD in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). From 1996 to 1999, 2,153 participants without marked elevations of serum ALT at baseline were randomized (1,081 to placebo, 1,072 to metformin) and treated for an average of 3.2 years.

ALT increased during the first two years of the study and was slightly but significantly lower in the participants randomized to metformin. In regression models adjusted for sex, baseline age, FPG, and FI, these differences remained significant but disappeared after adjustment for weight, FPG, and FI changes at each examination.

The 3-year cumulative incidence for the development of abnormal ALT concentrations was not significantly different (mean ± s.e. 21.4 ± 1.4% and 24.6 ± 1.4%, P = 0.11) in the metformin versus placebo groups but was lower in individuals in both groups who lost more weight by the end of year 1. In the metformin group, the incidence was 19.4 ± 2.4% vs. 27.5 ± 3.7% for the highest vs. lowest quartile of weight loss, and in the placebo group, it was 18.7 ± 3.4% vs. 28.8 ± 2.6%.

Over three years of follow-up in persons at high risk for the development of diabetes, serum ALT was consistently lower in those treated with metformin compared with those on placebo. This effect was mediated by weight loss, indicating that the effects of metformin therapy on ALT are via its effect on weight loss.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^112migWo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, specifically in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice - what is normal [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025).

- **Purpose of review**: No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight into the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

- **Recent findings**: There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

- **Summary**: The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences are required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^115Pd2K2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:

- **Renal impairment**: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based on the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
	- Before initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
	- Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4)].
	- Initiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m².
	- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g. the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
	- In patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly those that impair renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^1129FKdH]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in patients on metformin, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend initiating oral cobalamin at 50 mcg for 1 month in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency undergoing metformin therapy. Subsequent monitoring of serum cobalamin should be considered after 6 months and then at yearly intervals.

### Impact of baseline alanine aminotransferase levels on the efficacy of dapagliflozin and sitagliptin: Latent class analysis from the DIVERSITY-CVR study [^116F16c8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The eligible patients were randomly assigned using a computer-based dynamic allocation method. This method aimed to balance key baseline characteristics. An adjustment factor, HbA1c level, was a criterion for analysis among patients with normal baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (≤ 30 IU/L) and those with elevated ALT levels (> 30 IU/L). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the analysis.

Three models (M1 to M3) were employed, though explicit details about their configurations are missing in the text. However, it is implied that each model incorporates baseline ALT levels as a significant factor in assessing the efficacy of dapagliflozin and sitagliptin in this patient population.

This approach underscores the variability in treatment efficacy based on baseline liver function parameters, thus contributing valuable insights into personalized diabetes management strategies.

### Dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy reduces mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with diabetes mellitus [^117SPQA5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can accelerate the progression of cirrhosis. The potential for oral diabetes medications to counteract the mortality and morbidity of chronic liver diseases is unclear.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness of dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) versus metformin treatment alone in reducing mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with T2DM. We evaluated propensity score-matched cohorts of T2DM and cirrhosis patients treated with metformin or dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy. Data were obtained from the TriNetX Research Network. Our outcomes were all-cause mortality, composite risk of hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

- **Results**: Compared to patients on metformin alone, dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy users had a lower risk for both death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.89; P = 0.011) and hepatic decompensation (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46–0.93; P = 0.02) over 5 years. Patients on dual therapy had a lower risk for HCC (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.74; P = 0.001) compared to mono-metformin therapy patients.

- **Conclusion**: In our multicenter retrospective study, dual therapy was associated with better mortality and morbidity in cirrhosis patients with T2DM compared to those on metformin alone.

### Extracorporeal treatment for metformin poisoning: Systematic review and recommendations from the extracorporeal treatments in poisoning workgroup [^117NzdMZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for metformin toxicity, specifically concerning extracorporeal treatment (ECTR) indications for discontinuation, the EXTRIP 2015 guidelines recommend discontinuing ECTR if the lactate concentration is less than 7.35.

### Combination therapy using metformin or thiazolidinediones and insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^111i1uZD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The biguanide, metformin, sensitizes the liver to the effect of insulin, suppressing hepatic glucose output. Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal, leading to reduced plasma insulin concentrations. These classes of drugs may also have varying beneficial effects on features of insulin resistance, such as lipid levels, blood pressure, and body weight.

Metformin in combination with insulin has been shown to significantly improve blood glucose levels while lowering total daily insulin dose and body weight. Thiazolidinediones in combination with insulin have also been effective in lowering blood glucose levels and total daily insulin dose. Triple combination therapy using insulin, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione improves glycemic control to a greater degree than dual therapy using insulin and metformin or insulin and a thiazolidinedione.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones in type 1 diabetic patients. Although these agents are largely well tolerated, some subjects experience significant gastrointestinal problems while using metformin. Metformin is associated with a low risk of lactic acidosis, but should not be used in patients with elevated serum creatinine or those being treated for congestive heart failure.

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in body weight; however, this can be mitigated with careful lifestyle management. Thiazolidinediones may also lead to edema and are associated with a low incidence of hepatocellular injury.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: Moving towards a new paradigm [^11279Dub]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

While a more precise categorization paradigm may provide useful guidance to clinicians when dealing with suspected cases of MALA, the authors suggest that metformin does not play a contributing role in cases where any other condition could be attributed to the LA event and conclude that MULA "is probably by far the most common". The authors do not provide new data to justify such a conclusion, and this conclusion does not incorporate the additive and perhaps synergistic effect that metformin concentration has on inducing LA when a secondary event occurs. Contrary to the authors' assessment, MALA represents the majority of cases, as there is often insufficient information in real-world clinical settings to definitively exclude metformin as a contributing cause of LA.

The underlying assumption made by Lalau et al. is that a single low measurement of plasma metformin and the presence of any other hypoxic condition is sufficient to rule out metformin relatedness. We do not believe that metformin's involvement in the development of LA can be so easily excluded for two reasons.

First, metformin increases the risk of LA. Because of its ability to disrupt lactate metabolism, metformin accumulation can cause LA on its own in extreme cases (e.g. renal failure, overdose), and moderate accumulation can increase the likelihood that a secondary hypoxic event would lead to LA even though the severity of such an event may not have been sufficient to lead to LA in the absence of metformin accumulation. Thus, metformin use presents a risk of metformin plasma accumulation, which lowers the threshold for a hypoxic event to cause LA.

### SPL drug information for metformin hydrochloride [^114yv39Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

There is a boxed warning regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) and lactic acidosis. It is essential to use extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, particularly when there is concomitant use of certain drugs, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate. Additional risk factors include age ≥ 65 years, undergoing radiological evaluation with contrast, surgery, other procedures, hypoxic states such as acute congestive heart failure, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. It is crucial to assess eGFR before initiating metformin and to monitor annually or more frequently in patients at risk of renal impairment.

### Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis [^113Zce25]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced cholangiohepatitis accounts for 20–50% of non-viral chronic hepatitis cases. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic drug from the biguanide class, used in the treatment of overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis, characterized by marked elevations in serum liver transaminases and intrahepatic cholestasis, has been infrequently reported. Here, we report a case of acute cholangiohepatitis after the initiation of metformin treatment.

### Metformin for liver cancer prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vumZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Data on the potential effect of metformin on the risk of liver cancer are limited and inconsistent.

The objective of this study was to review the evidence currently available to examine the potential role of metformin in chemoprevention for liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study data sources included the PubMed and SciVerse Scopus databases. Selection included studies that assessed the effect of metformin therapy on the risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Summary effect estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis model. A database was developed on the basis of five studies consisting of approximately 105,495 patients with type 2 diabetes. In meta-analyses, metformin was associated with an estimated 62% reduction in the risk of liver cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.59; P < 0.001). The effect estimates were heterogeneous across the five included studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.001; I² = 78%). When restricting the analysis to the four studies related to hepatocellular carcinoma, metformin was again associated with a significantly lower cancer risk (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.17, 0.52; P < 0.001), and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity between these four studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.03; I² = 67%).

Metformin appears to be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, further investigation is warranted.

### Efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874: A 12-week, randomized, dose-response study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background metformin therapy [^111gC7RF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to conduct a dose-response assessment of the efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874 in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using stable doses of metformin.

This randomized, double-blind, statin-stratified, placebo-controlled, four-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with T2DM who were receiving background metformin therapy. After undergoing an eight-week washout period of non-metformin oral antidiabetic agents, 206 patients were randomized to receive either a placebo or PF-06291874 (doses of 30, 60, or 100 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. Both glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), along with safety endpoints, were assessed at baseline and post-baseline.

Dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c for PF-06291874 ranged from -0.67% (-7.29 mmol/mol) to -0.93% (-10.13 mmol/mol) and for FPG from -16.6 to -33.3 mg/dL after 12 weeks of dosing. The incidence of hypoglycemia was low and comparable between groups receiving PF-06291874 and placebo. Small, non-dose-dependent increases in LDL cholesterol (2 mmHg; diastolic BP > 1 mmHg) were observed with PF-06291874. Modest non-dose-dependent median increases were noted across PF-06291874 groups at 12 weeks for alanine aminotransferase (range, 37.6–48.7 U/L vs placebo) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 33.3–36.6 U/L vs placebo); these were not associated with changes in bilirubin. Small increases were observed in body weight (< 0.5 kg) in each PF-06291874 group compared to placebo.

In conclusion, in patients with T2DM, PF-06291874 significantly lowered HbA1c levels.

### Janumet [^111dLkM2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition associated with metformin use, and there have been postmarketing cases, including fatal ones. These cases often have a subtle onset and present with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence. Severe cases may involve hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Typically, metformin plasma levels exceed 5 mcg/mL. Metformin's mechanism decreases liver uptake of lactate, thereby increasing lactate blood levels, which may heighten the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in at-risk patients.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, it is crucial to institute general supportive measures promptly in a hospital setting. This includes the immediate discontinuation of Janumet. In patients treated with Janumet who have a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is advised to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin, as metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Hemodialysis has often resulted in symptom reversal and recovery.

Patients and their families should be educated about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, they should be instructed to discontinue Janumet and report the symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^116Nv2gb]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis associated with metformin therapy

Even though elevated metformin concentrations have been proposed to lead to lactic acidosis, there are few data regarding the level predisposing to hyperlactatemia. In fact, multiple studies suggest that elevated circulating lactate levels, often attributed to metformin, may actually not be caused by the drug. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes more frequently than in the general population; in some reports, the observed rate appears to be similar in patients on metformin versus other glucose-lowering agents. Additionally, metformin and lactate levels do not necessarily correlate, such that higher metformin concentrations do not consistently occur in those with more severe degrees of lactic acidosis. Finally, metformin levels are not linked to mortality in those who develop lactic acidosis, perhaps reflecting the primary effect of the underlying cause of the acidosis (e.g. hypoxia, hemodynamic compromise) on outcomes rather than incriminating metformin itself.

Although lactic acidosis remains a recognized, albeit rare, adverse event associated with metformin, the number of lactic acidosis cases continues to be very small, particularly when considering the widespread use of this drug. In the largest updated Cochrane meta-analysis, Salpeter et al. pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies. Not a single case of lactic acidosis was found in over 70,000 metformin patient-years or over 55,000 non-metformin person-years. In this analysis, 53% of prospective studies allowed for inclusion.

### Zituvimet [^115ojeiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**: Take Zituvimet orally twice daily with meals. Individualize the dosage based on the patient's regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl). Do not split or divide Zituvimet tablets. For patients not currently treated with metformin, the recommended starting dose is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. For patients already treated with metformin, the starting dose should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) alongside the current metformin dose. For those taking 850 mg metformin HCl twice daily, the recommended starting dose of Zituvimet is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1,000 mg metformin HCl twice daily.

- **Recommendations for use in renal impairment**: Assess renal function prior to the initiation of Zituvimet and periodically thereafter. Zituvimet is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It is not recommended for patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination Zituvimet product.

- **Discontinuation for iodinated contrast imaging procedures**: Discontinue Zituvimet at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: A serious complication of a common drug [^113RhPGz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of metformin use. It typically occurs in patients who are diabetic and also have other risk factors for lactic acidosis, including kidney and liver conditions, malignancy, or use of certain medications. We report a case of MALA in a man in his 70s with diabetes who presented with gradually worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, including severe abdominal pain and nausea. He reported these symptoms in the setting of metformin use with an acute kidney injury (AKI), likely brought on by poor oral intake and excessive antibiotic use for a urinary tract infection.

He was promptly started on intravenous fluids with a bicarbonate drip to concurrently treat his prerenal AKI and lactic acidosis, which resulted in rapid resolution of his symptoms. Renal function normalized within 12 days of admission. Since diabetic patients commonly use metformin and are also at higher risk of renal dysfunction, this case highlights the vulnerability of this group of patients and the need for increased knowledge and awareness of MALA.

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: An observational cohort study [^111jrJbt]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

While the renal safety of metformin is important in its own right, we were also motivated to analyze acute kidney injury (AKI) rates as a proxy for lactic acidosis. It is difficult to ascertain the true incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Observational studies may either overestimate or underestimate the incidence of MALA. Most cases of MALA are multifactorial, with other factors contributing to lactic acidosis, such as sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, or hepatic failure. Studies can be subject to ascertainment bias, with fitter patients being selected for treatment with metformin. Additionally, patients on metformin are more likely to have lactate levels measured, leading to the potential for overestimation of MALA.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), coding in isolation cannot be used in observational studies to establish cases of MALA due to a lack of specific code for lactic acidosis, and many studies have not included patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is, therefore, difficult to establish the safety of metformin in patients with CKD. We examined hospitalizations with AKI in patients treated with metformin as clinically significant lactic acidosis occurs in the presence of AKI. While we cannot draw conclusions regarding the rates of MALA in patients with CKD, we have shown that metformin use does not adversely affect mortality, which is reassuring. This finding is arguably more clinically significant than actual rates of MALA.

### Continuation of metformin use following a diagnosis of cirrhosis significantly improves survival of patients with diabetes [^112dAGbJ]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The risks and benefits of metformin use in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes are debated. Although data on a protective effect of metformin against liver cancer development have been reported, metformin is frequently discontinued once cirrhosis is diagnosed due to concerns about an increased risk of adverse effects in patients with liver impairment. This study investigated whether continuation of metformin following a cirrhosis diagnosis improves the survival of patients with diabetes.

Diabetic patients diagnosed with cirrhosis between 2000 and 2010 who were on metformin at the time of diagnosis were identified (n = 250). Data were retrospectively abstracted from the medical record. Survival of patients who continued versus those who discontinued metformin after cirrhosis diagnosis was compared using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards analysis.

Overall, 172 patients continued metformin, whereas 78 discontinued it. Patients who continued metformin had a significantly longer median survival than those who discontinued (11.8 vs. 5.6 years overall, P < 0.0001; 11.8 vs. 6.0 years for Child A patients, P = 0.006; and 7.7 vs. 3.5 years for Child B/C patients, P = 0.04, respectively). After adjusting for other variables, continuation of metformin remained an independent predictor of better survival, with an HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.24–0.78; P = 0.005). No patients developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis during follow-up.

### Effects of metformin exposure on survival in a large national cohort of patients with diabetes and cirrhosis [^117McX7o]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of type II diabetes mellitus is known to worsen the prognosis of cirrhosis. Patients with diabetes are often managed with multiple medications, including metformin and statins. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of metformin exposure on mortality, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with diabetes and cirrhosis while controlling for multiple concomitant exposures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis, diagnosed between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2016, within the Veterans Health Administration. We utilized marginal structural models and propensity-matching approaches to quantify the treatment effect of metformin in patients with pre-existing diabetes, regardless of prior metformin exposure.

- **Results**: Among 74,984 patients with cirrhosis, 53.8% had diabetes mellitus before the diagnosis of cirrhosis, and 4.8% were diagnosed during follow-up evaluations. Prior to the diagnosis of cirrhosis, 11,114 patients were actively using metformin. In these patients, the exposure to metformin, statins, and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-2-receptor blockers was independently associated with reduced mortality (metformin hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61–0.75). However, metformin was not associated with a reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation after adjustment for concomitant statin exposure. For patients with diabetes before a diagnosis of cirrhosis but no prior metformin exposure, metformin was also associated with reduced mortality.

### Metformin, sulfonylureas, or other antidiabetes drugs and the risk of lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia: A nested case-control analysis [^1177X1DT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Metformin plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. It decreases basal glucose output by suppressing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver and increases glucose disposal in muscle tissue. As the most worrisome complication, lactic acidosis (pH 4 mmol/l) continues to be discussed in the literature even though the absolute risk appears to be low, with incidence rates of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use ranging from 1 to 16.7 cases per 100,000 patient-years. Salpeter et al. identified all trials and cohort studies conducted between 1959 and 2002 and did not find a single case of lactic acidosis in 36,893 person-years of metformin exposure. Lalau and Race analyzed 49 cases of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use; overall mortality was not correlated with plasma lactate concentrations. Interestingly, plasma metformin concentrations were, on average, three times higher in patients who survived. All case subjects with lactic acidosis had, in addition to metformin use, acute or chronic comorbidities predisposing to lactic acidosis. These data suggest that lactic acidosis may be coincidental rather than causally associated with metformin use.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^1168XGU8]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

In the context of an increasing prevalence of diabetes and metabolic-associated liver disease, further well-designed, large randomized controlled trials are needed to understand how to optimize diabetes treatment in patients with cirrhosis. This optimization is crucial to prevent cardiovascular, hepatologic, and malignant complications.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^112mC2FE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite these proven benefits, metformin remains contraindicated in a large segment of the type 2 diabetic population, largely because of concerns over the rare adverse effect of lactic acidosis. For these reasons, the drug has been restricted to individuals with normal creatinine levels as a surrogate for renal competence. Other contraindications (e.g. any significant hypoxemia, alcoholism, cirrhosis, a recent radiocontrast study) also increase the risk for, or the consequences of lactic acidosis, but these are not the topic of this review.

Metformin belongs to the biguanide drug class (previous members include phenformin and buformin), developed for lowering glucose in the 1950s. Initial enthusiasm for biguanides was tempered over the next two decades by the growing recognition of their risk of lactic acidosis. A marked reduction in biguanide use occurred in the mid-1970s because phenformin, extensively adopted in clinical practice, was implicated in a number of fatal cases of this severe metabolic decompensation. The association with lactic acidosis eventually led to its withdrawal from the market. Importantly, lactic acidosis with phenformin seems to occur 10–20 times more frequently than with metformin. In contrast to metformin, modestly raised phenformin concentrations may reduce peripheral glucose oxidation and enhance peripheral lactate production, which can increase circulating lactate levels. In fact, phenformin levels correlate with lactate concentration, whereas metformin levels do not.

### Glumetza [^112DeFNe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Lactic acidosis**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset is often subtle, with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. It is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 or older, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk and manage the condition in these high-risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)]. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue Glumetza and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^114JpxwS]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Evidence regarding the potential effects of metformin in patients with HCC has been shown by a prior meta-analysis, which revealed that metformin significantly prolonged the survival of diabetic patients with HCC who were treated with curative intent. However, it had no effect in patients with more advanced stages of cancer. Consistent with this finding, Seo et al. found a significantly lower risk for HCC-specific mortality (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.30–0.49) and for retreatment events (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33–0.52) among metformin-treated patients.

A recent multicenter study reported that diabetic patients with HCC on metformin treatment had a significantly longer median overall survival (OS) than those who were not treated with metformin (22 vs. 15 months, p = 0.019), and that this effect was more relevant among patients with potentially curative stages of HCC. A unique finding is the potential negative impact on survival that metformin may have when used in combination with sorafenib, a well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of HCC. Schulte et al. demonstrated that co-treatment with metformin tended to have a negative impact on survival in patients treated with sorafenib (7 vs. 11 months, p = 0.088). This finding may be explained by the potential of metformin to confer resistance to sorafenib, as was previously shown by Casadei Gardini et al. in their study of 279 patients. In that study, 19% were on metformin therapy and 12% were on insulin therapy. For patients with HCC on metformin, the use of sorafenib was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and OS: 1.9 months and [text incomplete].

### Should restrictions be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? no, we should never again compromise safety [^111efm94]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin has been considered a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause lactic acidosis, which is exceptionally rare but potentially fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin.

However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions on metformin.

To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we present a Point-Counterpoint. In the point narrative, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy argue that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or in those at high risk of AKI, irrespective of underlying eGFR.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^114eRMt1]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Metformin was first identified as a potential hepatoprotective medication in 2005 when it was shown to reduce the risk of cancer in patients with diabetes. Since that time, several studies have demonstrated its potential preventative role against HCC development. For example, a meta-analysis by Zhang et al. including three cohort studies and four case-control studies with more than 16,000 diabetic subjects, showed that metformin treatment was associated with a 76% reduced risk of HCC (relative risk [RR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.13–0.46, p < 0.001). Importantly, the protective effect of metformin remained significant after adjusting for other risk factors such as the etiology of liver disease.

In the same year, another meta-analysis by Singh et al. showed similar results, with an overall 50% reduced risk of incident HCC among metformin-treated patients (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.73, p < 0.05). Consistent with the results by Zhang et al, when restricting the analysis to studies that adjusted for the effect of other anti-diabetic medications, the chemo-preventive effect of metformin was still significant and relevant (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75–0.83, p < 0.05).

Likewise, in a subgroup analysis of studies that adjusted for duration and/or severity of T2DM, the chemo-preventive effect of metformin still persisted. These findings were recently confirmed in a study showing that metformin use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HCC in T2DM (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51–0.68, p < 0.001). Additionally, this study indicated that metformin use was associated with a decrease in HCC risk.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112TWKig]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been shown to reduce total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, metformin is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis and has been considered contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary disease, as well as advancing age.

- **Objectives**: To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis and evaluate blood lactate levels for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive search was performed of electronic databases to identify studies of metformin treatment. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles and by contacting principal investigators.

- **Selection criteria**: Prospective trials and observational cohort studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes for at least one month were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years for metformin and non-metformin treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases was calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis, lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food).

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^117CqaeQ]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin has not only been associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality, but it has also been shown to prolong overall survival among patients with cirrhosis. A retrospective study conducted at the Mayo Clinic involving 250 patients with diabetes and cirrhosis taking metformin at the initial visit showed that patients who continued metformin during the observation period had significantly longer median survival than those who discontinued metformin (11.8 vs. 5.6 years in the overall cohort, p < 0.0001; 11.8 vs. 6.0 years for Child-Pugh class A patients, p = 0.006; and 7.7 vs. 3.5 years for class B/C patients, p = 0.04) even after adjusting for other variables (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.78, p = 0.005).

Notably, the administration of metformin was safe, as no adverse reactions were reported and none of the patients developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis during follow-up. These results were confirmed in a nested case-control study by Bosetti et al. and in a recently published Thai study of 1061 patients with cirrhosis followed up for at least 5 years. In this latter study, the outcomes of 719 metformin users were compared with those of 342 metformin non-users. Consistent with previous results, metformin-exposed patients had a significantly lower risk of developing HCC (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36–0.61, p < 0.001), and the median survival of metformin users was almost twice that of metformin non-users (6.9 and 3.88 years, respectively; p = 0.003). The small numbers for the subgroup analysis between each Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage of the disease did not allow for further detailed analysis.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: Metformin toxicities [^115Dy7UF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Metformin toxicity is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of metformin toxicity, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on evidence.

- **Discussion**: Metformin is a common medication used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Metformin toxicity is a spectrum of conditions that may be differentiated into three subgroups: metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA), and metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis (MULA). MILA is a condition found predominantly in patients chronically taking metformin or those with large acute overdoses. Conversely, MULA occurs in patients on metformin but with a critical illness stemming from a separate cause. MALA is rare but the most severe form, with mortality rates that reach 50%. Differentiating these entities is difficult in the ED setting without obtaining metformin levels. Patients with metformin toxicity present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and vital sign abnormalities. Laboratory analysis will reveal a high lactate with anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with elevated lactate levels in the setting of metformin use should be considered at risk for the most severe form, MALA. Patients with MALA require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, treatment of any concomitant condition, and early consideration of hemodialysis, along with specialist consultation such as nephrology and toxicology.

### Avandamet [^114T78sS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: Metformin: Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Avandamet should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

	- **Rosiglitazone**: Liver enzymes should be measured prior to the initiation of therapy with Avandamet in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional. Therapy with Avandamet should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5x upper limit of normal). Patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT levels ≤ 2.5x upper limit of normal) at baseline or during therapy with Avandamet should be evaluated to determine the cause of the liver enzyme elevation. Initiation of, or continuation of, therapy with Avandamet in patients with mild liver enzyme elevations should proceed with caution and include close clinical follow-up, including more frequent liver enzyme monitoring, to determine if the liver enzyme elevations resolve or worsen. If at any time ALT levels increase to > 3x the upper limit of normal in patients on therapy with Avandamet, liver enzyme levels should be rechecked as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain > 3x the upper limit of normal, therapy with Avandamet should be discontinued.

- **Symptoms of hepatic dysfunction**: If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with Avandamet should be carefully considered.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: A systematic review of case reports and case series [^114ASKk6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There were several interesting but unexpected findings in this study. First, a higher peak level of serum creatinine was associated with favorable survival. Indeed, apparent renal failure may help clinicians generate a high index of suspicion for MALA with appropriate evaluation, resulting in earlier diagnosis and expedient delivery of RRT. On the other hand, patients with higher serum creatinine levels at the initial presentation may also have a relatively indolent disease course rather than an acute episode of fulminant metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse. However, our data was not sufficient to determine whether the timing of RRT was early or late as it is difficult, if not impossible, to define the onset of MALA.

Second, female patients had a better survival than male patients. Although it is likely that the efficiency of RRT may be better among female patients due to smaller body size, the information on body mass index (BMI) was rarely available in the published reports. Future prospective research is warranted to clarify the sex difference or the effect of BMI.

- **Limitations**: Although the comprehensive nature of this systematic review can be interpreted as a strength, several limitations deserve particular mention in the work. Publication bias is a critical concern in this study, as severe cases with unexpected favorable outcomes may be more likely reported by clinicians and accepted by medical journals. We compared the mortality rate of selected MALA patients between 1995 and 2010 with those from a pharmacovigilance database covering the same time span.

### Should metformin be our antiglycemic agent of choice post-transplantation [^114TkvVw]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a major complication associated with solid-organ transplantation, sharing many similarities with type 2 diabetes mellitus. While metformin is recommended as the antiglycemic agent of choice in the general population, guidelines post-transplantation do not endorse metformin with equal importance and promote meglitinides as the agents of choice. Concerns with the tolerability and safety of metformin in the complex polypharmacy of transplant recipients are likely causative factors for reluctant prescription among clinicians. However, such practice denies recipients a wide array of benefits attributed to metformin use in the general population. These include attenuation of abnormal glucose metabolism (diabetes treatment and prevention), weight neutrality, improvement in pathophysiological components of the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, subclinical inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), lipid-lowering properties, cardiovascular protection, and antineoplastic potential. Whether such benefits translate from the general population to our high-risk recipients requires further investigation. By discussing the evidence of the risk/benefit ratio of metformin, the aim of this article is to promote the safe use of metformin as the first-line antiglycemic agent in the context of solid-organ transplantation for a host of indications that require clinical validation with appropriately designed trials.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117SdiUM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been shown to reduce total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, metformin is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis and has been considered to be contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary diseases, and advancing age.

In a second analysis, lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food).

### Metformin — the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: What does the evidence tell us [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycemia, and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal.

T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycemic control, safety, tolerability, and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids, or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Maladaptive: Do we avoid metformin unnecessarily [^111NcV1N]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Convention holds that the use of metformin is contraindicated in many patients due to concerns about lactic acidosis. However, evidence suggests that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is at most idiosyncratic. Awareness of this evidence should permit broader use of this valuable medication.

### Dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy reduces mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with diabetes mellitus [^113rhThc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can accelerate the progression of cirrhosis. The potential for oral diabetes medications to counteract the mortality and morbidity of chronic liver diseases is unclear.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness of dual metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) vs. metformin treatment alone in reducing mortality and hepatic complications in cirrhotic patients with T2DM. We evaluated propensity score-matched cohorts of T2DM and cirrhosis patients treated with metformin or dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy. Data were obtained from the TriNetX Research Network. Our outcomes were all-cause mortality, composite risk of hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

- **Results**: Compared to patients on metformin alone, dual metformin and GLP1-RA therapy users had a lower risk for both death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.89; P = 0.011) and hepatic decompensation (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46–0.93; P = 0.02) over 5 years. Patients on dual therapy had a lower risk for HCC (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.74; P = 0.001) compared to mono-metformin therapy patients.

In conclusion, our multicenter retrospective study found that dual therapy was associated with better mortality and morbidity outcomes in cirrhosis patients with T2DM compared to those on metformin alone.

### Probable hepatotoxicity associated with the use of metformin in type 2 diabetes [^111aKhWt]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

This case report describes a 44-year-old obese female who developed subclinical hepatic injury 4 weeks after starting metformin for type 2 diabetes. Her alanine aminotransferase levels rose, peaking at 5 months (738 U/l), but rapidly declined within days of discontinuing metformin. No alternative causes for the hepatic injury were identified. The likelihood of metformin-induced injury was rated as 7 on the Naranjo scale of adverse drug reactions. A brief review of the 11 previously reported cases in the English medical literature is also provided.

### Impact of metformin on the prognosis of cirrhosis induced by viral hepatitis C in diabetic patients [^111CcYy9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance plays a role in hepatocarcinogenesis and is decreased by metformin treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of metformin treatment on the prognosis of compensated hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

We studied an observational prospective cohort (1988–2007) at a university hospital referral center. A total of 100 consecutive diabetic patients (53 men, age 61 ± 11 years) with ongoing HCV cirrhosis and no contraindication for metformin were included in a screening program for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The patients were prospectively followed up for HCC incidence, liver-related death, or hepatic transplantation. The level of platelet count was significantly lower in patients treated with metformin (n = 26) compared with those not treated with metformin (n = 74) [117 (interquartile range, 83–166) vs. 149 (105–192) Giga/liter, P = 0.045]. During a median follow-up of 5.7 (3.8–9.5) years, one patient was lost to follow-up, 39 developed a HCC, and 33 died from liver causes or were transplanted.

The 5-year incidence of HCC was 9.5% and 31.2% (P = 0.001) and of liver-related death/transplantation, 5.9% and 17.4% (P = 0.013), in patients who received metformin treatment and in those who did not, respectively. In multivariate analysis, metformin treatment was independently associated with a decrease in HCC occurrence [hazard ratio, 0.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.79); P = 0.023] and liver-related death or transplantation.

### Metformin-induced hepatotoxicity [^114vvBUr]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Six weeks after discharge, the patient again developed malaise, nausea, and jaundice 24 hours after deciding on his own to take a dose of 850 mg of metformin. Laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 4.8 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL, AST 237 units/L, ALT 764 units/L, GGT 3,318 units/L, and ALP 622 units/L. Continued laboratory tests showed progressive improvement, reaching normal values in four weeks. He has since been treated with gliclazide-modified release (60 mg/day) and remains asymptomatic with good metabolic control (HbA1c 6.8%).

The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity remains difficult because of the lack of reliable markers for use in general clinical practice. In our patient, the exclusion of other diagnostic alternatives, the temporal sequence with positive unintentional rechallenge, and the absence of other drugs all convincingly support the diagnosis of metformin-induced liver damage.

- **Clinical scales**: Clinical scales may add consistency to the diagnostic process by translating the suspicion of hepatotoxicity into a quantitative score. The CIOMS/RUCAM (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) instrument is currently considered the best method for assessing causality in drug-induced hepatotoxicity and states the following rates: ≤ 1 relationship excluded, 1–2 unlikely, 3–5 possible, 6–8 probable, > 8 highly probable. Our patient scored 13 points, which indicates a certain or very likely diagnosis of metformin-induced liver toxicity.

- **Drug properties**: Metformin is not considered intrinsically hepatotoxic. In fact, metformin may be beneficial in patients without pre-existing liver conditions.

### Synjardy [^113HfdcQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis has been reported postmarketing in cases associated with metformin, some of which were fatal. These cases often had an insidious onset, presenting with nonspecific symptoms like malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, and increased somnolence. Additionally, severe acidosis may lead to hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis without ketonuria or ketonemia, and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio with metformin plasma levels often exceeding 5 mcg/mL. Metformin reduces liver uptake of lactate, increasing blood lactate levels, which may heighten the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in susceptible patients.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted immediately in a hospital setting, with the immediate discontinuation of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. For patients treated with SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and diagnosed or suspected of having lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended. This is to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin, as metformin is dialyzable with a clearance rate of up to 170 mL/minute under favorable hemodynamic conditions. Hemodialysis has often led to symptom reversal and recovery.

It is crucial to educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, they should discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and report the symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately.

### Synjardy [^111xJty6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning: Lactic acidosis**: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years or older, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Clinical outcomes with metformin use in diabetic patients with compensated cirrhosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ruWAL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of metformin in patients with cirrhosis, but no improvement in liver histology.

- **Aim**: To investigate the impact of metformin on mortality and hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to February 2023 for studies reporting results regarding the impact of metformin on all-cause mortality and hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis. The risk of bias was assessed by the ROBINS-I Cochrane tool. R software 4.3.1 was used for all analyses.

- **Results**: Six observational studies were included in the final analysis. Metformin use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality or liver transplantation [hazard ratio (HR): 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37–0.82], while no benefit was shown in the prevention of hepatic decompensation (HR: 0.97; 95% CI 0.77–1.22). In the subgroup analysis, metformin use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality or liver transplantation (HR: 0.50; 95% CI 0.38–0.65) in patients with metabolic-associated steatohepatitis cirrhosis, while two studies reported no survival benefit in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (HR: 0.39; 95% CI 0.12–1.20).

- **Conclusion**: Metformin use is associated with reduced all-cause mortality, but not with the prevention of hepatic decompensation in people with diabetes with compensated cirrhosis. The mortality benefit is most likely driven by better diabetes and cardiovascular health control.

### Riomet [^116thJnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, increasing lactate blood levels, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Riomet. In Riomet-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue Riomet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Continuous use of metformin in patients receiving contrast medium: What is the evidence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FUBrM]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Substantial inconsistencies exist in guidelines regarding recommendations of metformin usage with the administration of a contrast medium. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether the risks of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and lactic acidosis increase with metformin use in diabetic patients receiving a contrast medium.

- **Methods**: Studies were retrieved from databases from inception to May 15, 2021. Studies that compared the outcomes of using metformin with those not using metformin during contrast medium administration were included. The primary outcomes were the incidence of CI-AKI and lactic acidosis. The secondary outcomes were renal function changes from baseline. Data analysis used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes.

- **Results**: Analyses of two randomized controlled trials and four retrospective cohorts examining a total of 1,459 patients revealed no significant differences in the incidence of CI-AKI (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.63) and in changes in renal function measurements (serum creatinine: MD = 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.05; estimated glomerular filtration rate: MD = 0.22, 95% CI, -2.47 to 2.91) after contrast medium administration between patients using and not using metformin.

- **Conclusions**: There is no evidence that continuing metformin during contrast medium administration is associated with a higher risk of CI-AKI, lactic acidosis, or renal function deterioration compared to patients who discontinued metformin or who were not using it.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114NpD4s]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals with NAFLD frequently have co-morbidities, and as a result, polypharmacy is common. Therefore, a review of prescribed medications, use of over-the-counter medications, and alternative/complementary medicines should be undertaken. Commonly prescribed agents used to treat other conditions may contribute to hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. amiodarone, tamoxifen) or accelerate progression (e.g. methotrexate). While the published literature is at times conflicting, capturing the use of methotrexate (including duration of exposure and cumulative dose) is particularly relevant, as it is a potential cofactor promoting the presence of persistent transaminitis and/or an increased risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients who are overweight or diabetic. It is advisable to consider recommending the discontinuation of relevant hepatotoxic medications after risk assessment, involving other relevant specialists as necessary.

Moreover, it is important to conduct a medicines use review because discrepancies between patient-reported and medical record-documented medications exist in more than 50% of patients with liver disease, particularly those taking more than five medications. Accordingly, we suggest practitioners document a treatment history and medicines use review. The rationalization of medicines that may accelerate disease progression should be considered.

Poor diet and limited physical activity are common in people diagnosed with NAFLD.

### Should restrictions be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? Yes, they should be relaxed! What's the fuss [^116AZ61X]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause lactic acidosis, a condition that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of whom have serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², yet have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin.

To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the preceding point narrative, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy argue that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or in those who are at high risk of AKI, irrespective of underlying eGFR.

### Dulaglutide decreases plasma aminotransferases in people with type 2 diabetes in a pattern consistent with liver fat reduction: a post hoc analysis of the AWARD programme [^115wyCcC]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dulaglutide versus placebo on liver and glycaemic/metabolic measurements in a population with type 2 diabetes, as well as in a subgroup with non-alcoholic fatty liver/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,499 participants from the AWARD-1, AWARD-5, AWARD-8, and AWARD-9 clinical trials were included in this analysis (dulaglutide 1.5 mg, n = 971 and placebo, n = 528). Thresholds of alanine aminotransferase levels ≥ 30 IU/l in men and ≥ 19 IU/l in women were used to determine the subgroup with non-alcoholic fatty liver/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Objectives included changes from baseline to 6 months in: (1) alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels in the overall population; and (2) alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and glycaemic/metabolic measurements (e.g. HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, body weight, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment) in the non-alcoholic fatty liver/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis subgroup.

- **Results**: In the overall population at 6 months, dulaglutide significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels compared to placebo [least squares mean treatment differences: -1.7 IU/l (95% CI -2.8, -0.6), P = 0.003; -1.1 IU/l (95% CI -2.1, -0.1), P = 0.037; -6.6 IU/l (95% CI -12.4, -0.8), P = 0.025, respectively]. In the subgroup with non-alcoholic fatty liver/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as determined by alanine aminotransferase levels greater than or equal to the upper limit of normal, mean baseline liver enzyme levels were also evaluated.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with renal impairment solely due to drug accumulation [^1124NBJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

We suspect that the life-threatening complication of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, solely due to drug accumulation following renal impairment, occurs more frequently than previously reported and is not necessarily associated with other predisposing factors for lactic acidosis.

- **Methods**: During a period of 13 months at a tertiary referral center, the incidence of lactic acidosis of any etiology was 12.8% [67 of 524 total intensive care unit (ICU) admissions]. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis solely as the result of drug accumulation was diagnosed in 6% of all the patients suffering from lactic acidosis (4 of 67 patients).

- **Results**: These patients presented with severe circulatory shock due to lactic acidosis. We could not identify any predisposing factor for lactic acidosis other than renal impairment. Deterioration of diabetic nephropathy was suspected to be responsible for the accumulation of metformin followed by lactic acidosis, finally resulting in multiorgan failure. The diagnosis was supported by extensively elevated serum levels of metformin. Two patients died during ICU treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Our data indicate that the incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis solely due to metformin accumulation is possible and underestimated. Symptoms of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are unspecific, and physicians should be aware that metformin, if prescribed in patients with renal impairment, can cause fatal lactic acidosis due to drug accumulation.

### Type 2 diabetes and metformin use associate with outcomes of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis [^114XChLg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Factors that affect outcomes of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are unclear. We studied associations of type 2 diabetes, levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and use of antidiabetic medications with survival and liver-related events in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: We collected data from 299 patients with biopsy-proven NASH with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis from tertiary hospitals in Spain, Australia, Hong Kong, and Cuba, from April 1995 through December 2016. We obtained information on the presence of type 2 diabetes, level of HbA1c, and use of antidiabetic medications. Cox proportional and competing risk models were used to estimate and compare rates of transplant-free survival, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

- **Results**: A total of 212 patients had type 2 diabetes at baseline and 8 of 87 patients developed diabetes during a median follow-up time of 5.1 years (range, 0.5–10.0 y). A lower proportion of patients with diabetes survived the entire follow-up period (38%) than of patients with no diabetes (81%) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.23; 95% CI, 1.93–9.29). Higher proportions of patients with diabetes also had hepatic decompensation (51% vs 26% of patients with no diabetes; aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.005–4.11) and HCC (25% vs 7% of patients with no diabetes; aHR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.74–16.80). Averaged annual HbA1c levels over time were not associated with outcomes. Metformin use over time was associated with a significant reduction in risk of death or liver transplantation (aHR, 0.
