## Question

Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of subclinical hyperthyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical definition and excluding transient or spurious causes. Then, I should verify persistence with repeat testing and classify severity by TSH level. Next, I will determine etiology using TRAb and scintigraphy. After that, I need to stratify risk by age, comorbidities, and symptoms. Then, I will map treatment thresholds to TSH severity and risk groups. Finally, I will outline etiology-specific therapies, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise decision algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence quality grading.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical definition and immediately exclude mimics and transient causes, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a false positive or a self-limited process; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4 and normal T3, and I should double-check for exogenous thyroid hormone, recent iodinated contrast, nonthyroidal illness, acute illness, glucocorticoids, dopamine, and central hypothyroidism before labeling this as endogenous SH, as these can suppress TSH without true hyperthyroidism [^114r4s2v] [^113KAsiX].

> Wait, let me verify persistence before committing to a diagnosis or treatment plan; I should repeat TSH (and free T4/T3) in 3 to 6 months to confirm that the abnormality is sustained, because transient thyroiditis and mild Graves' disease can remit spontaneously, and persistence is more typical of nodular autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild GD often resolve, so I should not jump to therapy on a single suppressed TSH alone [^115eGybG].

> I will now examine severity stratification by TSH, since management hinges on this; Grade I corresponds to TSH below normal but at least 0.1 mIU/L, and Grade II corresponds to TSH persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L, and I should confirm that the lower TSH range carries higher risks of atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular mortality, and bone loss, which will influence treatment thresholds and urgency [^116SUZCg] [^115YVijG] [^113dZPzQ].

> Next, I should review etiologic diagnosis because therapy depends on cause; I need to check TRAb to assess Graves' disease, and if TRAb is negative or the presentation is atypical, I should obtain radioactive iodine uptake and thyroid scintigraphy to distinguish diffuse uptake (Graves'), focal uptake (toxic adenoma), or multifocal uptake (toxic multinodular goiter), and I should remember that suppressed uptake suggests thyroiditis rather than true hyperthyroidism, which would change management entirely [^116LBLwf] [^113vLPEX].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification before deciding to treat; older age (≥ 65 years), cardiovascular disease or risk factors, osteoporosis or postmenopausal status without bone protection, and hyperthyroid symptoms substantially increase the potential harm of untreated SH, whereas younger, asymptomatic patients without comorbidities have lower absolute risk, though I must acknowledge that observational data show increased atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular mortality, and fractures with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, even if randomized trial evidence for treatment benefit is limited [^112mMkjF] [^115YVijG] [^113dZPzQ] [^112dTyB1].

> Let me think about treatment thresholds and align them with guideline strength; for TSH persistently < 0.1 mIU/L, treatment is strongly recommended in patients ≥ 65 years, in those with cardiac disease or osteoporosis, in postmenopausal women not on estrogen or bisphosphonates, and in symptomatic individuals, whereas in asymptomatic patients < 65 years, treatment can be considered but is a weaker recommendation; for TSH 0.1–0.44 mIU/L, observation is generally acceptable in asymptomatic patients < 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, with treatment considered in older adults or those with cardiac disease or symptoms, and I should confirm that these are GRADE-based recommendations with variable evidence quality [^112mMkjF] [^1111b4h5] [^114Zketr] [^117McmWv].

> I need to ensure the treatment modality matches the etiology; for toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma, radioactive iodine is generally preferred, especially in older adults, whereas for Graves' disease, antithyroid drugs are reasonable first-line, with RAI or surgery as alternatives, and I should double-check that there is no strong evidence for pretreatment with ATDs before RAI in elderly SH patients, where risks may outweigh benefits; symptomatic palpitations or tremor can be managed with beta-blockers while definitive therapy is planned [^112SS3Re] [^112USUzp] [^112PqCVC].

> But wait, what if the patient is young with mild SH due to Graves' disease; I should consider that spontaneous remission occurs in a subset, so observation with close monitoring is reasonable, and if I choose ATDs, low-dose methimazole is typically preferred given efficacy and safety, with periodic reassessment for remission or progression; I should confirm that long-term low-dose MMI is an accepted strategy in some patients who relapse or prefer to avoid ablation [^112PqCVC] [^114mrL9g] [^112KHaf3].

> Next, I should review monitoring and endpoints; after initiating therapy, I will check free T4 and TSH every 4 to 6 weeks until stable, then every 3 to 6 months, with the goal of restoring a normal TSH, and after RAI for TMNG or TA, I should monitor thyroid function at 1 to 2 month intervals until stable, anticipating hypothyroidism in a substantial proportion over time and adjusting replacement accordingly; I need to ensure I am not over-treating into iatrogenic hypothyroidism, which carries its own risks [^112PqCVC] [^115iTaes].

> I should double-check special populations; in older adults, the threshold to treat SH with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L is lower because of higher risks of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and fractures, and observational data support increased cardiovascular mortality with SH, reinforcing a lower treatment threshold; in pregnancy, SH is managed differently and warrants guideline-directed obstetric endocrinology input; in children, management is individualized and often conservative given the limited evidence base and potential for spontaneous resolution [^112oPhzR] [^115YVijG] [^112Hx6Qi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought treatment clearly reduces atrial fibrillation and fractures in SH, but I should correct that; while observational studies link TSH < 0.1 mIU/L to higher AF and fracture risks, randomized trials demonstrating that restoring euthyroidism prevents these outcomes are sparse, so I must frame treatment decisions as risk-based and evidence-informed, incorporating patient preferences and shared decision-making, especially in younger patients with mild suppression [^111kErfz] [^112Q79n9] [^111trvZ4].

> Let me reconsider the decision algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm SH biochemistry and exclude mimics, repeat TSH in 3 to 6 months to verify persistence, classify severity by TSH, determine etiology with TRAb and scintigraphy, stratify risk by age and comorbidities, treat if TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L in high-risk groups or consider treatment in selected younger patients, choose modality by etiology, monitor to a normal TSH, and continue long-term surveillance for relapse or hypothyroidism; this stepwise approach aligns with ATA guidance and contemporary reviews [^112uyPJK] [^115eGybG].

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a **low TSH with normal free T4 and T3**. Management is guided by TSH level, age, comorbidities, and etiology [^112mMkjF] [^112SS3Re]. Treat when TSH is **< 0.1 mIU/L** [^112mMkjF] or when patients are ≥ 65 years, have cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^112mMkjF]; use antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease [^111SjHiZ] and radioactive iodine for toxic nodular disease [^112SS3Re]. Observe with periodic monitoring if TSH is 0.1–0.4 mIU/L and the patient is < 65 years, asymptomatic, and without risk factors [^114Zketr]. Address exogenous causes and monitor bone and cardiovascular health [^113TYi4r] [^113dZPzQ] [^115YVijG].

---

## Definition and diagnosis

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a **low or undetectable TSH** with normal free T4 and T3 [^1141dvkY]. Confirm persistence by repeating TSH in 3–6 months [^115EuM3S] and exclude transient causes (e.g. thyroiditis, medications, nonthyroidal illness) [^115eGybG].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with:

- **Cardiovascular**: Increased atrial fibrillation [^115YVijG], heart failure, and mortality, especially in older adults [^115XH3rG].
- **Bone**: Reduced bone mineral density [^113dZPzQ] and higher fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women [^112DJd5K].
- **Progression**: Risk of overt hyperthyroidism, higher when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L [^111kErfz].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is recommended in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| TSH < 0.1 mIU/L | Treat [^notfound] |
| Age ≥ 65 years | Treat [^notfound] |
| Cardiovascular disease or risk factors | Treat [^notfound] |
| Osteoporosis or postmenopausal women not on estrogen/bisphosphonates | Treat [^notfound] |
| Hyperthyroid symptoms | Treat [^notfound] |
| TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L, asymptomatic, < 65 years, no risk factors | Observe with monitoring [^114Zketr] |

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on **etiology**:

- **Graves' disease**: Antithyroid drugs (methimazole preferred) [^112USUzp]; consider radioactive iodine or surgery if relapse or intolerance [^112KHaf3].
- **Toxic nodular disease**: Radioactive iodine is preferred [^112SS3Re]; surgery for large goiters or suspicion of malignancy [^112PqCVC].
- **Exogenous causes**: Stop or reduce thyroid hormone; treat factitious thyrotoxicosis [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During treatment, **monitor TSH every 3–6 months** until stable, then annually [^notfound]. Assess cardiovascular and bone health regularly, especially in older adults or those with risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Evidence for treatment benefits in asymptomatic patients with mildly suppressed TSH is limited; decisions should be individualized and consider patient preferences [^111trvZ4] [^117KaLMs]. Overtreatment risks iatrogenic hypothyroidism and adverse effects, so careful monitoring is essential [^115iTaes].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Repeat TSH in 3–6 months and exclude transient causes [^115EuM3S].
- **Treat if**: TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, age ≥ 65, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^112mMkjF].
- **Observe if**: TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L, asymptomatic, < 65 years, no risk factors [^114Zketr].
- **Tailor therapy**: Based on etiology, patient preference, and comorbidities [^112SS3Re].

---

Subclinical hyperthyroidism requires a **personalized approach** that balances risks and benefits, with treatment for high-risk patients and observation for low-risk patients, alongside ongoing monitoring and individualized care [^114Zketr].

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112uyPJK]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114Zketr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation", and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^115DjnDr]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently < 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms (2/++0). Persistent SH is defined as a TSH level of < 0.1 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period, and the underlying thyroid disorder should be diagnosed and is most commonly TMNG, GD, or TA. The task force elected to recommend treatment of all SH patients younger than 65 years of age with persistent TSH < 0.1 mU/L and hyperthyroid symptoms, while noting insufficient data for or against treatment of younger persons or premenopausal women with serum TSH < 0.1 mU/L.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — osteoporosis and fracture outcomes: Most studies show decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, but not in men or premenopausal women. In the largest individual study, the hazard rate for all major osteoporotic fractures was 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.014–1.26), with risk increasing over time such that after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% with low TSH had at least one major osteoporotic fracture versus 6.9% with normal TSH. A participant-level meta-analysis found hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures (4.9 fractures per 1000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs. 11.2 per 1000 person-years), with risks further increased when TSH was < 0.1 mIU/L compared to 0.1–0.44 mIU/L and for endogenous SH.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — mortality and cardiovascular outcomes show increased risks associated with SH. An individual-level meta-analysis concluded that SH confers a 24% increased risk of overall mortality. Cardiovascular mortality is increased, with hazard ratios of 1.52 and 1.29 from two meta-analyses, and the risk was greater with TSH < 0.1 mU/L compared with 0.1–0.4 mU/L. A large cohort of 26,707 people followed for 12 years also reported increased cardiovascular mortality with SH, and SH subjects appear to be at particular risk for heart failure, especially older subjects and those with lower TSH levels.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults [^112oPhzR]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians. In this narrative review, we present published data focusing on special considerations in the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in older adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted from January 2000 to December 2024 to identify pertinent articles in English for this narrative review. Results: Due to significant cardiovascular risk if untreated, both overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated in older adults. Findings from observational studies do not support treating older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) < 7 mIU/L. However, observational data have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 7.0–9.9 mIU/L and of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure in those with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, suggesting levothyroxine treatment in these individuals should be considered. Data from clinical trials failed to show improvement with levothyroxine in hypothyroidism symptoms or fatigue in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with placebo. Over- and under-replacement with thyroid hormone is common and should be avoided, as population-based studies have shown associations with adverse cardiovascular and skeletal events. Subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH < 0.1 mIU/L should be treated in older individuals as it has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and bone density loss based on observational data. Randomized controlled trials have shown that long-term low-dose methimazole is a viable alternative to radioactive iodine in older adults with hyperthyroidism. Conclusions: A personalized approach should be undertaken in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Multiple factors should be considered, including physiological age-related changes in thyroid function, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Care should be taken to maintain euthyroidism in order to avoid adverse events.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

Introduction — thyrotoxicosis definitions, treatment scope, and U.S. epidemiology: Thyrotoxicosis refers to a clinical state that results from inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels, and hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. β-blockers may be used in almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful only in some. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA).

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Benefits of thyrotropin suppression versus the risks of adverse effects in differentiated thyroid cancer [^116XReNf]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), there are no recommendations on the optimal serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration to reduce tumor recurrences and improve survival, while ensuring an optimal quality of life with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this review was to provide a risk-adapted management scheme for levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with DTC. The objective was to establish which patients require complete suppression of serum TSH levels, given their risk of recurrent or metastatic DTC, and how potential adverse effects on the heart and skeleton, induced by subclinical hyperthyroidism, in concert with advanced age and comorbidities, may influence the degree of TSH suppression.

Summary

A risk-stratified approach to predict the rate of recurrence and death from thyroid cancer was based on the recently revised American Thyroid Association guidelines. A stratified approach to predict the risk from the adverse effects of L-T4 was devised, taking into account the age of the patient, as well as the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and skeletal risk factors that might predispose to the development of long-term adverse cardiovascular or skeletal outcomes, particularly increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. Nine potential patient categories can be defined, with differing TSH targets for both initial and long-term L-T4 therapy.

Conclusion

Before deciding on the degree of TSH suppression during initial and long-term L-T4 treatment in patients with DTC, it is necessary to consider the aggressiveness of DTC, as well as the potential for adverse effects induced by iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism. More aggressive TSH suppression is indicated in patients with high-risk disease or recurrent tumor, whereas less aggressive TSH suppression is reasonable in low-risk patients. In patients with high-risk DTC and an equally high risk of adverse effects, long-term treatment with L-T4 therapy should be individualized and balanced against the potential for adverse effects. In patients with an intermediate risk for thyroid cancer recurrence and a high risk of adverse effects of therapy, the degree of TSH suppression should be reevaluated during the follow-up period. Normalization of serum TSH is advisable for long-term treatment of disease-free elderly patients with DTC and significant comorbidities.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodule management — medical therapy for FNA-benign nodules: Routine LT4 suppressive therapy for an FNA-benign nodule is not recommended. A clinically significant (> 50%) decrease in nodule volume is reported with LT4 therapy only in a minority of patients, and in iodine-deficient regions this favorable effect appears more convincing with the concomitant administration of iodine supplements. Although long-term thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression may prevent an increase in nodule or thyroid size, nodule regrowth occurs after cessation and long-term therapy seems inevitable, and TSH-suppressive therapy with LT4 is reported as not useful for prevention of goiter recurrence after lobectomy in patients with normal TSH levels by most. Safety signals include a decrease in bone density in postmenopausal females and an increase in major osteoporotic fractures with sustained subclinical hyperthyroidism, a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with suppressed TSH levels, and overall mortality appears increased.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^113vLPEX]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism in children [^112Hx6Qi]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) below the lower limit of the reference range in the presence of normal free T4 and free T3 levels. Depending on the degree of TSH suppression, SH could be defined as mild (TSH, 0.1–0.45 mU/L) or severe (TSH < 0.1 mU/L). Patients with SH are often asymptomatic when symptoms are present, they are similar to the symptoms in patients with overt hyperthyroidism, although they are usually milder. The management of the SH is uncertain and should be individualized. We present this review after an extensive literature search and long-standing clinical experience. This review provides the prevalence, causes, clinical presentation, investigation, and therapeutic approach of SH in children.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^113TYi4r]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

Post–radioactive iodine follow-up for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or TA — monitoring and expected outcomes specify that follow-up within the first 1–2 months should include free T4, total T3, and TSH, repeated at 1–2 month intervals until stable, then at least annually (1/+00). For TMNG, resolution of hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 55% at 3 months and 80% at 6 months, with an average failure rate of 15%; goiter volume decreases by 3 months with further reduction over 24 months for a total 40% size reduction. For TA, 75% are no longer hyperthyroid at 3 months, with nodule volume decreased by 35% at 3 months and 45% at 2 years; persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism ranges from 0% to 30%. Long-term risk of clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism is about 8% by 1 year and 60% by 20 years for TA, and an average of 3% by 1 year and 64% by 24 years for TMNG. If thyroid hormone therapy is necessary, the dose required may be less than full replacement due to persistent autonomous thyroid function.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^112dTyB1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 946 adults, 93% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. Those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a 34% higher risk of fracture compared with individuals with euthyroidism.

Meaning

This study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture, highlighting a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of these patients to prevent bone mineral disease.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases: 2016 update [^1145ew69]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction comprises subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by normal free thyroxine (FT4), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) with decreased or undetectable TSH and normal FT4. Up to 10% of the elderly have SHypo, which is usually asymptomatic. Individual participant data (IPD) analyses of prospective cohort studies from the international Thyroid Studies Collaboration show that SHypo is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1,58 for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, 95% CI 1.10–2.27), as well as increased risk of stroke, and heart failure (HF) for both higher and lower TSH. Small studies found that SHypo affects carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), diastolic function, peripheral vascular resistance, endothelial function, and lipid profile. SHyper is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16–2.43) and CHD events (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.46). The TSH threshold for initiating treatment is unclear. In the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the best evidence suggests SHypo therapy should be started at TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, and SHyper therapy at TSH < 0.1 mIU/L. Recommendations on screening are discordant, but most guidelines advocate that thyroid function should be checked in those at risk for hypothyroidism, those over 60, and those with known CHD and HF. This review updates current evidence on the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, as well as on screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

In this community-based cohort study of more than 10 000 participants, we found a statistically significant association between subclinical hyperthyroidism at baseline and fracture-related hospitalization but no evidence for an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and fracture-related hospitalization. In continuous analyses of thyrotropin levels, we found a significant risk of fracture-related hospitalization for suppressed levels of thyrotropin, even among those with normal free thyroxine levels. This study provides clinical insight into the management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, for which there is currently insufficient evidence, to our knowledge.

Our observation of an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and fracture risk is consistent with the literature. In a meta-analysis, Blum et alpooled individual participant data from 13 prospective cohort studies comprising 70 289 participants who had a median age of 64 years, were predominantly White, and had a median follow-up of 12 years. This study reported that subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with a pooled relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.06–1.53) for all fractures, after adjustment for age and sex. In addition, no association was found between subclinical hypothyroidism and risk of fracture. Our study extends these findings to a younger, community-based cohort that included both Black and White participants, included extensive adjustment for potential confounders, and had a longer follow-up period (median follow-up of 21 years vs 12 years).

Our study found that suppressed thyrotropin levels were significantly associated with fracture risk among those with normal free thyroxine levels. Fracture-related hospitalization was highest for those with mildly to severely suppressed thyrotropin levels (< 0.56 mIU/L). Further research is needed to confirm our findings and to better understand the biological mechanism by which subclinical thyroid dysfunction is associated with bone health. Those with mildly suppressed thyrotropin levels (0.1 mIU/L to < 0.56 mIU/L) may benefit from being identified as a high-risk group through more aggressive screening. It also supports the existing recommendation, which is to treat all patients 65 years of age or older with subclinical hyperthyroidism when the thyrotropin level is persistently lower than 0.1 mIU/L for the prevention of bone mineral disease. Furthermore, it argues for a potential need for closer monitoring of those with a thyrotropin level between 0.1 and 0.56 mIU/L to prevent bone resorption.

Iodinated contrast–associated thyrotoxicosis — observational and case–control data report variable risks across settings: in Boston, 5 of 49 (10.2%) developed a suppressed TSH 1–4 weeks after a contrast CT with only one overt case; in an iodine-sufficient Australian cohort, 2 of 72 (2.8%) overt and 7 of 72 (9.7%) subclinical cases occurred within 8 weeks; in Germany, 2 of 788 (0.25%) developed overt hyperthyroidism after coronary angiography; in New Zealand, subclinical hyperthyroidism occurred in 2 of 102 (2%) after a contrast CT; in Italy, 1.9% of 1752 had suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3; and in Turkey, new subclinical hyperthyroidism occurred in 5.9% of 101 by 8 weeks. A U.S. case–control study found an odds ratio of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.08–3.60, p = 0.03) with 23 exposures needed per case, while supplementation trials did not find increased thyroid dysfunction with 200–300 μg/d.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1124wReJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) thyroid dysfunction screening — burden and cardiovascular associations: In the United States, about 46 per 1000 persons have subclinical hypothyroidism, 7 per 1000 have subclinical hyperthyroidism, 3 per 1000 have "overt" hypothyroidism, and 5 per 1000 have "overt" hyperthyroidism. Two prospective studies (Health ABC and CHS) showed a correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and congestive heart failure, particularly when serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is greater than 10.0 mIU/L, with HRs 3.26 [CI, 1.37 to 7.77] and 1.88 [CI, 1.05 to 3.34], and it is not known whether thyroid replacement therapy would modify this potential risk.

### Hyperthyroidism [^116LBLwf]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12–18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management… [^112eGwm3]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Assessment and Follow-Up A clinical algorithm outlines diagnostic assessment and therapeutic recommendations. After an initial clinical history and physical examination, patients who appear to have subclinical hyperthyroidism without a clear etiology should be re-evaluated with repeat serum free T 4, T 3, and TSH tests. We recommend monitoring thyroid function tests monthly for three months before making a more definitive therapeutic decision, but other reasonable periods of monitoring may be also be considered. 1 We conducted a computer-derived search for evidence-based studies relating to subclinical hyperthyroidism and found few prospective, randomized, controlled studies. Therefore, individual studies, case reports, and personal clinical experience must serve as the parameters for assessing patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

These patients could be treated with either antithyroid agents, surgery, or radioactive iodine or, alternatively, these patients could simply be monitored periodically. 26 In general, in patients with a clearly detectable TSH level that is only slightly below the normal range, long-term monitoring seems most appropriate to determine if the TSH level will remain constant. Currently, most endocrinologists in the United States recommend definitive treatment of patients with overt hyperthyroidism by ablating thyroid function with radioactive iodine and then maintaining the patient on life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy. 26 In Japan, the preferred initial mode of treatment of patients with overt hyperthyroidism is the use of long-term antithyroid medications. 42 It is unknown if the same paradigm should apply to patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may respond to treatment differently than patients with overt Graves' disease and multinodular goiters, although subclinical hyperthyroidism likely represents a form of one or more of these basic disease processes. Unlike patients with overtly symptomatic multinodular goiter, some patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism appear to undergo a sustained remission following a trial of antithyroid agents. A decision regarding treatment of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism that is based on evidence-based research is problematic because prospective controlled studies comparing different therapies do not exist. Patients with persistent thyroid function abnormalities without another discernible etiology or overt clinical symptoms might benefit from a course of low-dose antithyroid therapy. Definitive therapy in patients without specific signs or symptoms seems to be unnecessarily aggressive — at least at the outset of disease.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism detected by screening… [^1178vcjE]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

In the course of screening to detect thyroid dysfunction, physicians will also find laboratory abnormalities in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic persons. In such cases, when the TSH level is elevated, physicians must decide whether treatment with levothyroxine is indicated. When the TSH level is low, decisions are more difficult because treatments for hyperthyroidism have potentially serious complications, and minimal evidence about the benefits and risks of early treatment exists. In this issue of American Family Physician, Shrier and Burman 3 provide a balanced review of existing evidence and suggest a plan for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of asymptomatic persons with a low TSH level. Their treatment recommendations are sensible. They recommend monitoring patients who have a low but detectable TSH level.

For patients with an undetectable TSH level, they favor treatment with low-dose methimazole or propylthiouracil, after taking into account the patient's general health, preferences, and ability to pay for medication. Unfortunately, this literature has little relevance to asymptomatic patients who are found to have a low TSH level. When a low TSH level is found in asymptomatic patients who are screened in the primary care setting, it returns to the normal range in about 40 percent of cases. 4–6 In these patients, Shrier and Burman 3 recommend repeating the TSH measurement and pursuing additional tests only if the TSH level is low in four consecutive measurements. They recommend a 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake and thyroid scan if the TSH level is persistently low.

Shrier and Burman's recommendations 3 are practical because they offer guidance for physicians and patients who would be reluctant to simply ignore TSH values that are borderline low. No studies to date have examined the benefits of this approach. Evaluating all patients who have low TSH levels adds cost and complexity to a primary care screening program. In asymptomatic patients who have detectable, borderline-low TSH values, the chance of finding underlying thyroid disease is negligible. Even if a multinodular goiter or diffuse increased uptake is found, monitoring rather than treatment still would be recommended.
