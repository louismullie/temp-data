## Question

Help me analyze this pleural fluid, LDH 335, total protien: 2.9, glucose 59

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret pleural fluid results with LDH 335 U/L, total protein 2.9 g/dL, and glucose 59 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these values meet standard criteria for exudate versus transudate. Then, I should verify what the glucose and LDH imply about infection or malignancy. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and what additional tests are warranted. Finally, I will outline immediate management steps and pitfalls to avoid, anchoring on guideline-based thresholds and likelihood frameworks.

> Let me first confirm the classification question. Light's criteria require pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio greater than 0.5, pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH; if any one is met, the effusion is exudative, and if none are met, it is transudative. Wait, let me verify the absolute LDH threshold I'm using: many labs cite an upper limit of normal for serum LDH around 200 U/L, so two-thirds of that is roughly 133 U/L; at 335 U/L, the pleural LDH clearly exceeds that, so this meets Light's criteria as an exudate even without serum values, though I should double-check the lab's reference range when possible [^e1e40a6e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology just because it's an exudate. I need to check what the glucose and LDH suggest. A pleural glucose below about 60 mg/dL is concerning for complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, and an LDH above about 1,000 U/L is a strong predictor of needing drainage; here, glucose is 59 mg/dL and LDH is 335 U/L, so glucose is borderline-low and LDH is elevated but not in the very high range, which keeps complicated infection on the list but is not definitive for empyema by itself [^9e162d38] [^4ab05966]. I should confirm that pH was measured, because pH less than 7.2 is the most reliable single biochemical marker for complicated infection and the need for drainage, and if pH is not available, glucose less than 3.3 mmol/L (about 60 mg/dL) can be used as a surrogate in the right clinical context, which fits this case [^9e162d38] [^dbc1101f].

> Next, I should review the differential. Exudative effusions with low glucose include complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema, rheumatoid pleurisy, and some malignant effusions; tuberculosis can also present with exudative fluid but typically has normal or near-normal glucose, so the low glucose here pushes me toward infection or rheumatoid rather than TB as the leading consideration, though I must not exclude TB solely on glucose [^68a42a58] [^18465759]. Let me consider malignancy as well: malignant effusions are often exudative and can occasionally have low glucose, but the LDH here is not markedly elevated, which makes a purely malignant effusion less likely to explain the low glucose by itself, so I should keep both infection and malignancy on the list while prioritizing infection given the glucose and clinical context [^68a42a58] [^78887094].

> I will now examine what additional tests I need to secure the diagnosis. I should confirm that pleural fluid pH was measured, because it will refine the probability of complicated infection and the need for immediate drainage; if pH is 7.2 or less, drainage is indicated, whereas if pH is above 7.2, I should integrate LDH, glucose, and imaging features before deciding on tubes [^9e162d38]. I need to check cell count with differential, Gram stain, and cultures, ideally inoculating into blood culture bottles to improve yield, because culture negativity is common and biochemical markers alone are insufficient to diagnose infection [^ce074021]. If TB is a concern based on epidemiology or lymphocytic predominance, I should add ADA and consider interferon-gamma testing, recognizing that ADA performance varies with age and prevalence, and that guidelines support ADA in the right context despite imperfect accuracy [^003c67c3] [^52847012]. If malignancy remains a concern, I should send a large-volume sample for cytology, as first-pass sensitivity is modest and larger volumes improve yield, and consider image-guided pleural biopsy if cytology is negative but suspicion remains high [^bd8da9c8] [^cd9ad482].

> Let me think about immediate management implications. Given glucose around 59 mg/dL and an exudative profile, I should have a low threshold for chest tube drainage if pH is 7.2 or less, if the patient is clinically deteriorating, or if imaging shows loculations or septations; conversely, if pH is above 7.2 and the patient is stable, close observation with repeat ultrasound and serial assessment is reasonable, with escalation if parameters worsen [^9e162d38] [^4ab05966]. I should confirm that antibiotics are aligned with community-acquired pneumonia coverage and local resistance patterns, and escalate to anaerobic coverage if empyema is suspected, while arranging early pleural drainage if infection progresses or fails to improve [^ce074021] [^9e162d38].

> But wait, what if this is a pseudoexudate from diuretic-treated heart failure or another transudative process complicated by infection? I should double-check serum protein and LDH to apply Light's criteria correctly, and if Light's criteria misclassify a transudate as exudate, the serum-effusion albumin gradient can help; a gradient greater than 1.2 g/dL supports a transudate, though here the protein is 2.9 g/dL, which is already in the exudative range by absolute value, making a true exudate more likely [^68a42a58] [^notfound]. I need to ensure I interpret the biochemistry alongside the clinical picture and imaging to avoid anchoring bias.

> In summary, I should confirm the following: this is an exudative effusion by Light's criteria due to LDH 335 U/L, the low glucose raises concern for complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, and the next best steps are to obtain pH if not already done, send cell count with differential, Gram stain, and cultures in blood culture bottles, and obtain chest ultrasound or CT to assess for loculations; if pH is 7.2 or less or if the patient is unstable or has loculated fluid, proceed to chest tube drainage, whereas if pH is above 7.2 and the patient is stable, observe closely with serial reassessment and escalate based on clinical evolution [^e1e40a6e] [^9e162d38] [^ce074021].

This pleural fluid profile shows an **exudative effusion** (LDH 335 U/L > 2/3 upper limit of normal; protein 2.9 g/dL is borderline and needs a serum protein ratio to confirm) [^e1e40a6e] and a **low glucose** (59 mg/dL) that suggests a complicated parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or malignancy [^9e162d38] [^78887094]. Immediate next steps are to **obtain pleural fluid pH**, cell count with differential, Gram stain, and culture; send cytology if malignancy is suspected; and correlate with imaging and clinical context to guide drainage or further testing [^68a42a58] [^9e162d38].

---

## Interpretation of pleural fluid parameters

### Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

- **Normal range**: 100–190 U/L (varies by lab).
- **Interpretation**: LDH 335 U/L exceeds 2/3 of the upper limit of normal, indicating an exudative effusion by Light's criteria [^e1e40a6e].
- **Clinical significance**: Elevated LDH reflects high cell turnover and pleural inflammation, seen in infection, malignancy, and rheumatoid effusions [^d29cef50].

---

### Total protein

- **Normal range**: 0.2–0.6 g/dL in transudates; > 0.5 g/dL in exudates.
- **Interpretation**: 2.9 g/dL is elevated and suggests an exudate, but confirmation with pleural/serum protein ratio is needed [^e1e40a6e].
- **Clinical significance**: High protein supports exudative processes such as infection, malignancy, or inflammatory effusions [^d29cef50].

---

### Glucose

- **Normal range**: 60–100 mg/dL (similar to serum).
- **Interpretation**: 59 mg/dL is low and suggests consumption by cells or pathogens, or impaired pleural permeability.
- **Clinical significance**: Low glucose is associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions, empyema, rheumatoid effusions, and malignant effusions [^9e162d38] [^78887094].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Given the exudative profile with low glucose, the **most likely etiologies** include:

| **Etiology** | **Clinical context** | **Pleural fluid features** |
|-|-|-|
| Complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema | - Pneumonia <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis | - Exudative <br/> - Low glucose <br/> - Low pH <br/> - High LDH <br/> - Positive cultures |
| Malignant pleural effusion | - Cancer history <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Night sweats | - Exudative <br/> - Low glucose <br/> - High LDH <br/> - Positive cytology |
| Rheumatoid pleurisy | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Joint symptoms | - Exudative <br/> - Low glucose <br/> - High LDH <br/> - Lymphocytosis |
| Tuberculous pleural effusion | - TB exposure <br/> - Immunocompromise | - Exudative <br/> - Lymphocytosis <br/> - ADA > 40 U/L |

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Obtain pleural fluid pH**: pH < 7.2 strongly suggests complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema and the need for drainage [^9e162d38].
- **Cell count with differential**: Neutrophil predominance supports infection; lymphocytosis suggests TB or malignancy [^notfound].
- **Gram stain and culture**: Essential to identify bacterial infection and guide antibiotics [^ce074021].
- **Cytology**: Indicated if malignancy is suspected [^cd9ad482].
- **Imaging**: Chest ultrasound or CT to assess for loculations, pleural thickening, or masses [^68a42a58].
- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate symptoms, history, and labs to guide management [^0d4402cd].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema**: Low pH, low glucose, and high LDH indicate the need for chest tube drainage and antibiotics; consider intrapleural fibrinolytics if loculated [^9e162d38] [^4ab05966].
- **Malignant effusion**: Cytology confirms diagnosis; consider pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for symptom control [^0e015cb4].
- **Rheumatoid effusion**: Manage with anti-inflammatory therapy and monitor response [^notfound].
- **Tuberculous effusion**: ADA, interferon-gamma testing, and anti-TB therapy if confirmed [^003c67c3].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Serum protein and LDH**: Needed to apply Light's criteria accurately [^e1e40a6e].
- **Assay variability**: LDH and protein methods vary; interpret results in clinical context [^0ecd0283].
- **Single sample**: Repeat thoracentesis may be needed if initial results are inconclusive or clinical suspicion remains high [^d384f74b].

---

This pleural fluid is **exudative with low glucose**, most consistent with complicated parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or malignancy. Confirm with pH, cell count, Gram stain, culture, and cytology, and correlate with imaging and clinical context to guide timely drainage, antibiotics, or oncologic therapy.

The investigation of a pleural effusion is, in general, a very straight forward process with the combination of clinical history, examination, radiology and pleural fluid analysis leading to diagnosis in most cases. While most fluid samples are sent for routine analysis including protein, LDH, glucose, cytology and microbiology, there are a number of more unusual fluid analyses available which in some cases directly lead to, and in others are suggestive of the diagnosis. Moreover, other fluid markers are constantly being evaluated as a diagnostic tool. In this review, we describe these non-routine pleural fluid analyses in detail. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1 1990 to August 1 2009 were reviewed. Keywords searched in combination were pleural fluid, effusion, analysis, transudate, exudate and diagnosis.

### Shining a new light on pericardial fluid [^740e0241]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors found that physiological pericardial fluid is rich in protein, albumin, LDH and nucleated cells with low levels of glucose and cholesterol. They derived normal reference values for total protein (1.7–4.6 g/dL), pericardial fluid/serum protein ratio (0.29–0.83), LDH (141–2613 U/L), pericardial fluid/serum LDH ratio (0.40–2.99), albumin (1.19–3.06 g/dL) and pericardium to serum albumin gradient (0.18–2.37 g/dL). Normal reference intervals were also determined by optical microscopy for nucleated cells (278–5608 × 10⁶ cells/L), mesothelial cells (40–3790 × 10⁶ cells/L), leucocytes (19–2210 × 10⁶ cells/L) and lymphocytes (19–1634 × 10⁶ cells/L). While the study's modest sample size likely contributes to wide reference intervals, the results imply normal physiological pericardial fluid would meet traditional criteria for an exudate. The authors hypothesise that the unique composition of pericardial fluid may be due to increased pericardial vasculature permeability, pericardial mechanical stress due to cardiac contractility, or related to the abundant cell types found within the pericardial space.

The findings of the study highlight the potential for diagnostic errors when interpretive tools are used outside of their validated purpose. The Light's criteria were derived on fluid samples from a different physiological space with a composition distinct from pericardial fluid (table 1). Based on the current study, normal physiological samples would be routinely misclassified as exudates due to the rich cellularity and biochemical composition of pericardial fluid. Similar misclassification would likely occur with pathological specimens. More work remains to determine an adequate schema able to differentiate between transudative and exudative pericardial fluid. However, the efforts put forth by the authors to first define the normal composition of pericardial fluid is crucial and should be commended. This study is a step forward in the management of pericardial disease and provides a new standard in interpreting pathological pericardial fluid specimens.

Infections of the pleural space — pneumonia is the most common predisposing factor, with as many as 60% of patients with pneumonia developing an effusion and up to 30% being complicated; specimens should be delivered immediately or placed into anaerobic media, and inoculation into blood culture bottles has been shown to increase the sensitivity by 20%, although cultures may fail to yield an organism in up to 50% of cases; fluid should be sent for cell count and differential, pH, total protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cholesterol, and a meta-analysis showed the best predictors of an exudate were pleural fluid cholesterol level > 55 mg/dL and an LDH > 200 U/L or the ratio of pleural fluid to serum cholesterol > 0.3; when tuberculosis or a fungal pathogen is suspected, pleural biopsy for culture, molecular testing, and histopathology increases diagnostic sensitivity, and the IDSA/ATS/CDC guidelines recommend the measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and free interferon-λ (IFN-λ) in pleural fluid with ADA sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 79% and ≥ 83% and free IFN-λ of ≥ 89% and ≥ 97%, though ADA performance in developed countries is quite variable and related to method, tuberculosis likelihood, and false positives; in a multicenter pleural infection study, major pathogens recovered in decreasing order were Streptococcus anginosus group, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, other streptococci, Enterobacterales, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and among hospital-acquired infections S. aureus tops the list, with 33%–50% methicillin-resistant.

### Does this patient have an exudative pleural effusion? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^e1e40a6e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1–250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8–46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5–38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein > 0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06–5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### What is the normal composition of pericardial fluid? [^f096e822]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Biochemical and cytological pericardial fluid (PF) analysis is essentially based on the knowledge of pleural fluid composition. The aim of the present study is to identify reference intervals (RIs) for PF according to state-of-art methodological standards.

Methods

We prospectively collected and analysed the PF and venous blood of consecutive subjects undergoing elective open-heart surgery from July 2017 to October 2018. Exclusion criteria for study enrolment were evidence of pericardial diseases at preoperatory workup or at intraoperatory assessment, or any other condition that could affect PF analysis.

Results

The final study sample included 120 patients (median age 69 years, 83 men, 69.1%). The main findings were (1) High levels of proteins, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but not of glucose and cholesterol (2) High cellularity, mainly represented by mesothelial cells. RIs for pericardial biochemistry were: protein content 1.7–4.6g/dL PF/serum protein ratio 0.29–0.83, albumin 1.19–3.06g/dL, pericardium-to-serum albumin gradient 0.18–2.37g/dL, LDH 141-2613U/L, PF/serum LDH ratio 0.40–2.99, glucose 80-134mg/dL, total cholesterol 12-69mg/dL, PF/serum cholesterol ratio 0.07–0.51. RIs for pericardial cells by optic microscopy were: 278–5608 × 10⁶ nucleated cells/L, 40–3790 × 10⁶ mesothelial cells/L, 35–2210 × 10⁶ leucocytes/L, 19–1634 × 10⁶ lymphocytes/L.

Conclusions

PF is rich in nucleated cells, protein, albumin, LDH, at levels consistent with inflammatory exudates in other biological fluids. Physicians should stop to interpret PF as exudate or transudate according to tools not validated for this setting.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase to adenosine deaminase ratio for tuberculous pleural effusion: an analysis of two cohorts [^0965b3a1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we failed to find the added diagnostic value of LDH/ADA to ADA. Therefore, the current evidence does not support LDH/ADA for TPE diagnosis. Given the small sample size and potential bias, further rigorous studies with large sample sizes are needed to validate our findings.

### Is the pleural fluid transudate or exudate? A revisit of the diagnostic criteria [^c324f6b8]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions are classified into transudates and exudates based on criteria developed in the 1970s. However, their accuracy has not been evaluated. We compared the performance of the pleural fluid absolute lactic dehydrogenase level (FLDH), fluid to serum ratio of LDH (LDHR), and fluid to serum ratio of total protein (TPR). TPR has been used instead of the absolute value of fluid protein based on the observation that fluid protein is influenced by changes in the serum protein concentration. However, the rationale for using LDHR remains unexplored.

Methods

Of 212 consecutive patients with pleural effusions, four with multiple causes and eight with an uncertain diagnosis were excluded. ROC curves were generated using sensitivity and 1-specificity values for TPR, FLDH, and LDHR and positive likelihood ratios (LR+ve) were computed using the optimum cut off values. The correlation between pleural fluid and serum concentrations of total protein and LDH was also estimated.

Results

Of 200 effusions studied, 156 were exudates and 44 were transudates. The optimum cut off levels were: FLDH 163 IU/l, TPR 0.5, LDHR 0.6, and the FLDH-TPR combination 163 and 0.4, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was: 0.89 (0.86 to 0.96) for FLDH, 0.86 (0.80 to 0.91) for TPR, 0.82 (0.77 to 0.89) for LDHR, and 0.90 (0.86 to 95) for FLDH-TPR. A significant correlation was observed between serum and pleural fluid protein levels in transudates and exudates (r = 0.5 and 0.6, respectively), but the correlation between serum and pleural fluid LDH levels was insignificant.

Conclusion

FLDH is the most accurate marker for the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates and LDHR has no role in this process. Combining TPR with FLDH appears to improve the diagnostic accuracy slightly.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase to adenosine deaminase ratio for tuberculous pleural effusion: an analysis of two cohorts [^1b0f7138]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public threat caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In 2020, approximately 1.5 million people worldwide died from TB. TB is categorized into pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB. Tuberculous pleurisy is one of the most common extrapulmonary TB, accounting for approximately 3% to 10% of all TB cases. Pleural effusion (PE) is a common sign of tuberculous pleurisy, termed tuberculous PE (TPE). Although PE can be seen in nearly all patients with tuberculous pleurisy, it is not a specific sign. Malignant disease, heart failure and pneumonia can also cause PE. Identifying TPE in undiagnosed PE patients is crucial because the delayed diagnosis can result in pulmonary TB, bronchopleural fistulas, TB empyema, and even long-term functional impairment.

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^a8b1db36]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This letter summarizes the current literature on pleural fluid biomarkers that predict treatment response to chemical pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters in patients with malignant pleural effusion. We found evidence on pleural fluid biomarkers to be limited to a few small studies, where the biomarkers prognostic value was not tested in separate validation cohorts. Although low pleural fluid LDH, high glucose, and high pH levels are associated with pleurodesis success, no clinically valuable biomarker has been identified. Hence, further research on the inflammatory processes of malignant pleural effusion and during definitive pleural procedures is needed, as well as proper testing of potential biomarkers in separate model derivation and validation cohorts.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^0f41f872]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 2009 and 2016, 93 patients presenting to our center with pleural effusions secondary to infection (excluding frank pus) were recruited and had biological samples stored. As control subjects, 31 cases of malignant effusions and 16 transudative effusions were also included in this analysis. The median age of patients with parapneumonic effusions was 66 years and there was a male predominance. Full patient demographics by etiology are represented in Table 1.

Table 1.
Patient Demographics, Baseline Biochemistry, and Pleural suPAR Levels

Pleural suPAR Levels in All Effusions

The median pleural suPAR of pleural effusions varied significantly by etiology, with parapneumonic effusions having significantly higher levels than malignancy and transudative effusions at baseline (P ≤ 0.01). Pleural suPAR was strongly correlated with the commonly used pleural fluid indicators of infection: pH (CC, −0.576; P < 0.01), glucose (CC, −0.632; P < 0.01), and LDH (CC, 0.596; P < 0.01), but not pleural fluid protein (CC, 0.057; P = 0.59) across all etiologies.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^42ef1324]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Between 2009 and 2016, patients presenting to a UK tertiary pleural service with undiagnosed pleural effusions requiring a diagnostic thoracentesis were prospectively recruited to an observational study (IRAS ethics number 08/H0102/11). All had routine serum and pleural fluid analysis, including a full blood count, serum CRP (C-reactive protein), pleural fluid pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). At the time of pleural fluid sampling, pleural ultrasound was performed by a physician at least level 1 British Thoracic Society ultrasound-trained (or equivalent) with the presence of loculations documented. Repeat ultrasounds or computed tomography scans were performed if clinically indicated, and the development of loculations was recorded. Patients gave consent for storage of their baseline pleural fluid and serum samples in a −70°C freezer for future analysis.

Patients were followed up at 1 year to ascertain the final diagnosis of their pleural effusion, which was decided by two independent respiratory consultants based on prespecified criteria (see Appendix E1 in the online supplement). Patients were otherwise treated as per standard care; see Appendix E2 for local guidelines on parapneumonic effusion management.

### The role of serum procalcitonin in establishing the diagnosis and prognosis of pleural infection [^23a9695e]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Infection is a common cause of undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion associated with high morbidity and mortality. The ability to identify bacterial pleural infection in adults (hereon referred to as "pleural infection") as the likely cause at presentation enables appropriate investigations and prompt treatment. In addition, this would ensure patients receive prompt inpatient treatment for pleural infection rather than undergo investigations for alternative pathologies such as suspected pleural malignancy.

Pleural infection may be indicated by symptomatology, classical radiological findings, positive blood culture, raised inflammatory markers, pleural fluid cytology or positive pleural fluid microbiology. However, commonly used serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white cell count (WCC) are well known to be general markers of pro-inflammatory states. Furthermore, pleural fluid culture is negative in up to 40% of samples in patients with classical symptoms and signs. Pleural fluid pH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose have been shown to be superior to these commonly used biomarkers in identifying pleural infection. Novel biomarkers found in blood and pleural fluid such as procalcitonin (PCT), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) have been studied to determine their clinical utility in pleural effusions with mixed and conflicting results.

### Predicting survival in malignant pleural effusion: development and validation of the LENT prognostic score [^da1aa913]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Additionally, a robust clinical risk score is likely to be invaluable in future RCTs in this area. The LENT score could be used as an eligibility criterion to select patients likely to survive sufficient time for the primary endpoint analysis, thereby ensuring studies remain suitably powered. It could also be used to balance randomisation groups in the clinical trial setting as a stratification/minimisation criterion.

The strengths of this study include its large sample size and the prospective nature of the case series. By including all patients in the survival analysis and accounting for missing data using multiple imputation or sensitivity analyses, we have ensured that all available data are used and the potential of missing important associations by using complete case data is minimised. We have also validated our risk model using an independent data set, which adds strength to our findings. The LENT scoring system is less subjective than PS alone and relies on readily available tests, allowing it to be rapidly calculated without additional costs. Additionally, as the LENT score has been developed using patients presenting with their first episode of MPE, regardless of previous cancer treatment, it is widely applicable and relevant in the clinical setting.

There are some limitations to the study. The LENT score has been developed using patients with robust diagnoses of MPE and hence may not be generalised to all patients with clinically suspected MPE or para-malignant effusions. We lacked data on the extent that patients had been pretreated for their malignancy and only had data for 'UK Cohort 1' on whether their effusion represented a new malignant diagnosis or recurrent/progressive disease. These factors may impact on survival, particularly in certain cell types such as breast cancer. Due to the diverse staging systems for the different pleural tumours, and the lack of a universal biomarker, it was not possible to include the extent of disease in our analysis. This would be interesting to evaluate in future studies as the associations between NLR and fluid LDH with survival, for example, may be surrogates for tumour burden.

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^9e27999a]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This research letter highlights the absence of suitable pleural fluid biomarkers to support clinical decision-making in the management of MPE. This is particularly relevant to treatment with IPCs, presumably due to the long-standing use of talc slurry pleurodesis via chest tube or thoracoscopic talc poudrage as first-line interventions. The current evidence on biomarkers is limited to a few small prospective studies with substantial heterogeneity in the definition of pleurodesis success (radiographic vs. patient symptoms) and the type of pleurodesis agent. Overall, the available studies do not adhere to gold standards for biomarker development, such as presentation of prognostic performance in separate model derivation and validation cohorts, and presentation of the added prognostic value to already known clinical biomarkers such as trapped lung or daily MPE fluid volume production.

Although there is evidence that low pleural fluid LDH, high glucose, and pH levels are associated with pleurodesis success in several small studies, none of them have shown promise as independent predictive biomarkers. High pleural fluid LDH, low glucose, low pH, and high protein levels reflect increased metabolic activity and thus high cancer cell activity, which may hinder the pleurodesis. However, they may also reflect more general inflammation, which could induce local inflammation during pleurodesis. Hence, there is a need for further understanding of the inflammatory processes involved in MPE and the response to definitive pleural procedures in these patients. The identification of key mechanisms for success, failure, or adverse events will improve patient-tailored MPE management, and could potentially lead to the development of targeted drug therapies to control MPE production. Currently, clinicians must still rely on clinical data derived from chest radiographs and measurement of fluid volume output to provide imperfect clues to the predicted outcome of pleurodesis.

### Important prognostic factors for survival in patients with malignant pleural effusion [^48da1e8b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Potential predictors of survival

We considered 12 potential independent prognostic factors for survival in 165 patients with MPE from the INCA database. The database included demographic characteristics (age and sex), primary tumor site, glucose in the pleural fluid, levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase in the pleural fluid, cytological and histological results, percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the pleural fluid, biochemical classification of pleural fluids into transudates or exudates, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS). Briefly, ECOG PS consists of 5 grades: normal activity, grade 0; symptomatic but fully ambulatory, grade 1; symptomatic but bedridden less than 50% of the time, grade 2; bedridden more than 50% during the daytime, grade 3; completely (100%) bedridden, grade 4; and dead, grade 5 (Table 1). The survival time (measured in months) was defined and calculated from the day of pathological diagnosis to the day of death. No patient was censored.

### Useful clinical biological markers in diagnosis of pleural effusions in children [^850dba9c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

In a patient with an undiagnosed pleural effusion, the first question to answer is whether the fluid is an exudate or a transudate. This is usually determined by means of Light's criteria, which differentiate transudative effusions from exudative effusions by measuring the levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase in the pleural fluid (PF) and serum. In patients under diuretic treatment, Light's criteria misclassify transudates as exudates, but the serum to pleural fluid albumin gradient usually remains above 12 g/L. When tests are done only in PF, protein concentration > 30 g/L performs at least as well as the other individual markers. To diagnose tuberculous pleuritis among exudates, PF adenosine deaminase and PF interferon-g exhibit high diagnostic accuracy. When malignancy is suspected the addition of tumour markers to the results of cytologic analysis increases the rate of detection. Other biochemical markers are useful in specific circumstances involving pleural effusion, such as amylase in effusions due to pancreatitis, or oesophageal rupture, and triglycerides in chylothorax. Several PF markers are associated with complicated parapneumonic effusion - e.g. low PF pH and glucose, and high PF LDH activity — although PF pH appears to be the best biochemical aid in decisions regarding chest tube drainage. Recent reports suggest that neutrophil-derived enzymes (polymorphonuclear elastase and myeloperoxidase) can be useful as early indicators of the need of chest tube insertion; however these findings must be confirmed in large series. This review discusses the clinical usefulness of biochemical markers in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions. The vast majority of prospective studies in this field have been conducted in adults and, although the mechanisms of pleural effusion production do not differ in children and adults, the prevalence of each etiologic cause does. Therefore it seems advisable to confirm or recalculate the predictive values of each marker in the paediatric population.

### Biochemical analysis of soft tissue infectious fluids and its diagnostic value in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a 5-year cohort study [^ee2ede09]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection and outcome measurement

Clinical data of all enrolled patients were extracted from electronic medical records. Data on age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension; diabetes; liver cirrhosis; chronic kidney disease; malignancy; autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren's syndrome; solid organ transplantation history; and alcohol use disorder), vital signs (including hypotension), physical examination (e.g. hemorrhagic bullae), laboratory results of blood and soft tissue fluids, and final discharge diagnosis were obtained. Based on the final discharge diagnosis, the patients were subsequently classified into NSTI and non-necrotizing SSTI groups. Typically, the diagnosis of NSTI at discharge is based on surgical findings and pathological reports. Patients who lacked supporting surgical findings or were successfully managed with medical treatment alone were classified into the non-necrotizing SSTI group.

The primary outcomes were the diagnostic performance of biochemical markers for NSTI, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, albumin, lactate, pH, and glucose, and the diagnostic performance of extravascular body fluid (EBF) criteria for NSTI using soft tissue infectious fluid. The biochemical markers and criteria investigated in this study were based on the common tests and previously established criteria. After a narrative review of EBF, the potential biomarkers and EBF criteria related to inflammation and cell damage were identified. Additional file 1 summarizes the biochemical tests and common EBF criteria used in this study. Based on the original Light's criteria, pleural effusion is classified as exudative when at least one of the three criteria is met. In this study, the total score for the Light's criteria, which represents the number of criteria met, was calculated and used as an additional independent parameter.

A subgroup analysis was planned to better understand whether biochemical tests and the EBF criteria could be utilized in patients without clear signs of NSTI. A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis identified two clinical signs as high-risk indicators for NSTI: hemorrhagic bullae and the presence of hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure of ≤ 90 mmHg), with positive likelihood ratios of 5.97 and 9.20, respectively. Thus, the subgroup analysis compared NSTI patients who did not exhibit hemorrhagic bullae or hypotension at presentation with those diagnosed with non-necrotizing SSTIs.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^78887094]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusions are a common entity, and although around a third are due to malignancy, there is a wide differential diagnosis. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Pleural Disease guidelines recommend initial pleural aspiration, often of large volume to relieve breathlessness, before proceeding to further investigations and potentially definitive treatments. Aspiration is recommended when a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is suspected in order to obtain biochemical parameters (which may identify alternative diagnoses), provide cytology to confirm diagnosis and guide oncological treatment, and to identify both non-expansile lung (NEL) and those who experience symptomatic benefit, informing further pleural management choices.

Pleural fluid (PF) biochemistry allows the differentiation of transudate and exudate and identifies pleural inflammation. Although MPE is commonly considered to be exclusively exudative, case series have demonstrated transudates in 5% of cases. Biochemical parameters do not reliably differentiate between pleural infection and inflammatory MPE, with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low glucose and low pH well recognised in either diagnosis.

PF cytology has a diagnostic sensitivity of around 60%; however, with the expansion of personalised oncological treatments which require specific molecular testing, insufficient information may be derived from a single cytology sample. Tsim et al demonstrated that testing was 'incomplete' (ie, insufficient material to permit molecular testing) in 47% of cytology positive effusions. In patients with a CT scan suggestive of malignancy, the OR for a malignant diagnosis with negative cytology was 2.25, but specific malignant radiological features were not assessed.

Large volume aspiration may reveal the presence of NEL, where insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is preferable to attempting pleurodesis as definitive pleural management. Therapeutic aspiration confirms symptomatic benefit from the pleural procedure. Psallidas et al showed that 85.7% of patients experienced a clinically significant symptomatic benefit after fluid drainage but it was not possible to predict which patients would not experience symptomatic relief.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^68a42a58]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### Expression of YKL-40 and MIP-1a proteins in exudates and transudates: biomarkers for differential diagnosis of pleural effusions? A pilot study [^228ee18c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study subjects

This retrospective study involved 60 patients with pleural effusions [49 exudates (EX) and 11 transudates (T)] (Table 1) who were hospitalized in the Respiratory Medicine Clinic of the Nicosia General Hospital between November 2012 and October 2014. For patients with exudates, pleural effusions were either parapneumonic (PN: n = 11) or were associated with tuberculosis (TB: n = 10), and malignant effusions associated either with lung cancer (LCa: n = 13) or with metastatic malignancies of non-lung origin (MCa: n = 15) (Table 2). The study protocol was approved by the Cyprus's National Bioethics Committee and the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical School, University of Crete. All participants completed and signed a consent form.

The determination of the etiology of pleural effusions was based on widely accepted criteria. The classification between exudates and transudates was based on Light's criteria, using serum and pleural fluid total protein and LDH measurements, and was further confirmed by the clinical diagnosis. Within exudates, PN effusions were characterized by coexistence of pneumonia, response to antibiotics and/or pleural fluid neutrophilia. Malignant effusions were diagnosed by cytological or histological examination. TB effusions were diagnosed with the presence of positive stain or culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the pleural fluid, sputum or pleural biopsy, or with the presence of typical caseating granulomas in pleural biopsy, adenosine deaminase levels in pleural fluid greater than 40 U/L and response to antituberculous therapy.

Sample collection and processing

Samples were obtained during the first day of patient's hospitalization and from the first successful thoracentesis, before patients had received any treatment. Simultaneously, 10 mL of venous blood were obtained. Samples were analyzed for total and differential cell count, glucose, total protein, LDH and pH. Additionally, cytological examinations and cultures for common pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were routinely performed in all pleural fluid samples. Aliquots of pleural fluid and blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min at room temperature and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until ΥΚL-40 and ΜΙΡ-1a protein measurements.

### Combined serum biomarkers in the noninvasive diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^609a143b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in lung disease. Parapneumonic effusion (PPE) refers to the filling of the pleural cavity with exudative pleural fluids, and this condition develops secondary to pneumonia. The presence of pleural effusion can be defined with a chest radiograph and/or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Identifying the cause of PPE is relatively difficult because patients have the same clinical symptoms, such as cough, chest pain and fever. Traditionally, PPEs are divided into uncomplicated PPE (UPPE), complicated PPE (CPPE), and empyema based on pleural fluid biochemical parameters. Including pH, glucose, and LDH. In addition to routine antibiotic treatments for PPE, patients with severe infection may need an invasive procedure, such as surgery, for resolution. Many reports have indicated that routine and optional pleural fluid tests, including biochemical parameters, proinflammatory cytokines, or enzymes, can be used to guide the clinician toward identifying infectious versus non-infectious pleural effusion and to further stage the PPE.

### Machine learning-based diagnostic model for determining the etiology of pleural effusion using age, ADA and LDH [^c2f09dda]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

By simply collecting the clinical parameters (age, pleural fluid ADA and pleural fluid LDH), machine leaning demonstrates strong performance in the etiological diagnosis of the pleural effusion, particularly for MPE, TPE, and transudative pleural effusion. This approach has the potential to serve as a valuable tool in assisting clinicians with identifying the underlying causes of pleural effusion.

### 36th international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 15–18 March 2016 [^26a553e4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods: We collected data of 30 patients who had clinical indication for thoracentesis or paracentesis. For each patient we performed arterial blood gas with lactate, total protein and serum LDH dosage, acid-base assessment with lactate, total protein and LDH dosage, cytology and bacterial culture on the fluid. Of every patient we calculated "liquid/serum" lactate ratio in order to measure the eventually present increase in pleural or abdominal effusion. The diagnosis of the liquid effusion nature (exudate or transudate) was performed by Light's criteria. A statistical analysis was carried out by performing a ROC curve in order to find the best cut-off for liquid/serum lactate ratio predicting the presence of an exudate.

Results: Of the 30 patients (13 [43%] males and 17 [57%] females, mean age 65,53 ± 13,271 years) 15 had peritoneal effusion and 15 had pleural effusion,15 patients had a exudate and 15 a transudate by Light's criteria. We performed a ROC curve to predict the presence of exudate by the liquid serum lactate ratio and we obtained an AuROC of 0.69 with the best cut-off value of 2,02 (Sensitivity 0,73 and Specificity 0,73). When we performed the same analysis only on pleural effusion patients we obtanined a an AuROC of 0,78 with the best cut-off value of 2,13 (Sensitivity 0,7, Specificity 1,0).

Conclusions: Liquid/Serum lactate ratio seems to be a promising tool to predict the presence of an exudate, in particular in pleural effusions. Further studies are needed to warrant these statements.

### Incidence of discordant pleural fluid exudates and diagnostic patterns: a retrospective cohort study [^a3bc2bd7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Light's criteria utilises pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to differentiate pleural effusions as exudative or transudative. In a subset of exudative pleural effusions, discordance occurs between LDH and protein (protein high, LDH low or vice versa). Research QuestionWhat is the incidence and diagnostic profile associated with discordant pleural fluid biochemistry?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 995 pleural fluid samples between 2015–2017 from a UK tertiary centre. Exudates were subdivided into concordant or discordant, with low protein defined as < 30g/L and low LDH < 170IU/L. Demographics and diagnostic patterns were assessed in both groups. Demographics and diagnostic patterns were assessed in both groups. Chi-squared tests and odds ratios (± 95% confidence interval) were calculated for each diagnosis between discordant and concordant pleural effusions, and adjusted ORs calculated using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

In 715 exudative pleural fluid samples, 229 (32%) were discordant. 85 (37%) of these displayed low protein, with high LDH, and 144 (63%) low LDH with high protein. The median age was higher in the discordant group than the concordant group (75 versus 70 years, p = 0.01). The proportion of patients with the following diagnoses were significantly higher in the discordant group compared to concordant: fluid overload (24/229, 10% discordant vs 10/486, 2% concordant, p < 0.0001), benign asbestos related pleural effusion (33/229, 14% vs 44/486, 9%, p = 0.031) and ICU associated effusion (20/229, 9% vs 15/486, 3%, p = 0.001). The following were less frequent in the discordant group: pleural infection (14/229, 6% vs 79/486, 16%, p < 0.0001), and malignant pleural effusion (77/229 34% vs 206/486, 42%, p = 0.025). These patterns were maintained when adjusting for age and sex.

Interpretation

Discordant pleural effusions are common, and represent a biologically distinct entity with different diagnostic patterns compared to concordant effusions. Clinicians should assess for discordance early and tailor investigations accordingly.

### Bayesian analysis using continuous likelihood ratios for identifying pleural exudates [^c7c3b8f7]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To ascertain if equations that calculate continuous likelihood ratios (CLRs) for pleural exudates improve pleural fluid categorization, especially when false positive or false negative test results are obtained by using Light's criteria.

Design and Setting

Retrospective review of the clinical and pleural fluid data from a consecutive series of patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis at the University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova (Lleida, Spain) over an 11-year period.

Patients and Methods

A total of 1490 patients with pleural effusion (298 transudates and 1192 exudates) were recruited into the study. The presence of a transudate or exudate was established by clinical judgment. We examined the comparative diagnostic accuracy of 4 tests (i.e. pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and pleural fluid to serum protein and LDH ratios) for discriminating between transudates and exudates. Decision thresholds were determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Equations for calculating CLRs derived from a logistic regression analysis based on a previously described method.

Results

Individual pleural fluid tests did not differ in their diagnostic accuracies according to ROC analysis. We calculated CLRs for the elements of Light's criteria and pleural fluid protein, and also illustrated the sequential use of CLRs for determining posttest probabilities. Overall, CLR formulas had marginal performance for the correct categorization of pleural fluid.

Conclusions

CLRs provide a probabilistic statement as to the likelihood an effusion is a transudate or exudate. However, clinical judgment is little changed by the application of CLRs, and in doubtful cases a great amount of uncertainty remains. This Bayesian approach is likely to have no major impact on the clinical practice.

### Pleural fluid tests to identify complicated parapneumonic effusions [^fe30a4c4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately 20% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia develop pleural effusions. In about 30% of these patients, the condition progresses to complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) or to empyema. Pleural fluid analysis may aid decision-making for drainage in nonpurulent pleural fluids.

Recent Findings

The classical pleural fluid criteria associated with a poor outcome without drainage are a pleural pH below 7.20, glucose below 60 mg/dl or a positive culture. Promising new biomarkers, in descending order of their likelihood ratios for detecting nonpurulent CPPE, include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase-2, neutrophil elastase, interleukin-8, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, terminal complement complex SC5b-9, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell, matrix metalloproteinase-9, matrix metalloproteinase-8 and C-reactive protein. Pleural fluid procalcitonin lacks accuracy as a diagnostic marker of CPPE. Notably, the absence of an appropriate independent reference standard is a major limitation of all studies dealing with diagnostic tests for nonpurulent CPPE.

Summary

The proposed markers have similar operating characteristics as traditional pleural fluid biochemistries. However, their role in guiding therapeutic approach to parapneumonic effusions, particularly when classical parameters are not informative, warrants further study.

### Laboratory investigation of peritoneal fluids: an updated practical approach based on the available evidence [^3bda89bf]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Even though analysis of peritoneal fluids (PF) is often requested to medical laboratories for biochemical and morphological tests, there is still no mutual agreement on what the most appropriate way is to manage PF samples and which tests should be appropriately executed. In this update, we tried to identify the most useful tests for PF analysis to establish best practice indications. We performed a literature review and examined available guidelines to select the most appropriate tests by an evidence-based approach. Accordingly, the basic PF profile should include (1) serum to effusion albumin gradient and (2) automated cell counts with differential analysis. This profile allows to determine the PF nature, differentiating between 'high-albumin gradient' and 'low-albumin gradient' effusions, which helps to identify the pathophysiological process causing the ascites formation. Restricted to specific clinical situations, additional tests can be requested as follows: PF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose, to exclude (LDH) or confirm (glucose) secondary bacterial peritonitis; PF total protein, to differentiate ascites of cardiac origin from other causes; PF (pancreatic) amylase, for the identification of pancreatic ascites; PF bilirubin, when a choleperitoneum is suspected; PF triglycerides, in differentiating chylous from pseudochylous ascites and PF creatinine, to detect intraperitoneal urinary leakage.

### Machine learning-based diagnostic model for determining the etiology of pleural effusion using age, ADA and LDH [^5aa3ee8d]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In the diagnosis of MPE, machine learning models have both higher precision and recall compared to the traditional method based on cancer ratio. Given the pathological analysis is time-consuming, the enhanced performance achieved on the laboratory biomarkers and demographic characteristic is significant for reducing the diagnostic time. In the diagnosis of TPE, machine learning models have higher precision but lower recall than traditional method based simply on pleural ADA, which means the machine learning have stricter criteria. The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis may be added as considerable features for the diagnosis of TPE to elevated the recall of the models.

The visualization of the first tree in the random forest gave us a good model explanation. The splits of ADA and LDH reveals similar diagnosis patterns in the clinical decision-making. Patients with high pleural fluid ADA (≥ 22U/L) and low pleural fluid LDH (< 353U/L) are indicative of TPE. Whereas patients with low pleural fluid ADA (< 22U/L) and high pleural effusion LDH (≥ 123U/L) are more likely to have MPE. The patients with median levels of pleural fluid ADA and LDH were hard to classify, so age is a critical differentiator as a final split, with older patients (≥ 59 years) have higher likelihood of MPE and younger patients (< 59 years) have higher likelihood of TPE. This strategy is similar in the clinical practice but the tree model gave us a specific split points with clear criteria and logical relationship.

### Recurrent pleural effusion due to duropleural fistula [^7df82f4a]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old woman with history of multiple spinal surgeries was found to have chronic recurrent pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, which showed a clear, "water-like" transudative fluid with a total protein level of 0.2 g/dL, glucose level equivalent to serum (118 mg/dL), low LDH level (76 U/dL), and low nucleated cell count. Given the appearance of the fluid, β-2-transferrin was checked, which confirmed the presence of cerebrospinal fluid in the pleural space. On the basis of the clinical presentation, pleural fluid analysis, clear appearance of the pleural fluid, and β-2-transferrin positivity, the patient was diagnosed with duropleural fistula.

Question 14 — cell counts and chemistries for suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB): The committee identified no accuracy studies and relied on clinical experience (very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 14 states, We suggest that cell counts and chemistries be performed on amenable fluid specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with remarks that amenable fluids include pleural, cerebrospinal, ascitic, and joint fluids. The guideline notes these tests can be performed in hours, are inexpensive, and are technically simple, and that specificity is poor if interpreted alone but substantially better in the clinical context with radiographic and laboratory findings.

### Multilevel likelihood ratios for identifying exudative pleural effusions (*) [^9e3ec4af]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine multilevel likelihood ratios for pleural fluid tests that are commonly used to discriminate between exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Design

Meta-analysis of patient-level data.

Patient Data

Selected studies included patients with diagnoses of exudative or transudative pleural effusions who underwent thoracentesis and laboratory analysis of their pleural fluid.

Measurements and Methods

Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and related bibliographies. Data were obtained for 1,448 patients from seven primary investigators or extracted from dot plots in published reports. Likelihood ratios were calculated from extracted data stratified across ranges of test result values.

Results

Sufficient data were available to calculate multilevel likelihood ratios for the elements of Light's criteria (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ratio of pleural fluid to serum LDH, and ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein), pleural fluid protein, ratio of pleural fluid to serum cholesterol, pleural fluid cholesterol, and gradient of pleural fluid to serum albumin. Each of these tests provided levels of likelihood ratios through the most clinically relevant range (0 to 10).

Conclusion

Multilevel likelihood ratios combined with a clinician's estimation of the pretest probability of an exudative effusion improve the diagnostic accuracy of discriminating between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Likelihood ratios avoid the use of confusing terms, such as "pseudoexudates", that derive from the use of single cutoff points for pleural fluid tests.

### Clinical significance of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion [^eefdec88]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical data collection

The following patient data were collected: general clinical data, including age, sex, and disease course; characteristics of the pleural fluid [location of pleural fluid, pleural fluid protein (pfPRO) level, pleural fluid ADA (pfADA) level, pleural fluid LDH (pfLDH) level, and pleural fluid glucose (pfGLU) level]; and peripheral blood test results [white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, serum ADA level, serum LDH level, albumin level, CRP level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)].

Statistical methods

SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Quantitative data conforming to a normal distribution are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and those with a non-normal distribution are expressed as median (25th, 75th quartile). Categorical variables are expressed as rate or percentage. Single-factor analysis of variance was used. When the variance was uniform, the Student–Newman–Keuls test was used for pairwise comparison among the three groups. When the variance was uneven, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the differences in rates between the groups. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the test level for pairwise comparisons between groups. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sensitivity and specificity of various indicators used for the evaluation of TPE were calculated. Data with a P -value of < 0.001 in the comparison of laboratory parameter ratios between groups were included in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each indicator. The area under the ROC curve was calculated, the optimal diagnostic threshold was analyzed and obtained, and the clinical values of different indicators for the diagnosis of the same disease were compared.

### Categorisation of pleural fluids in routine clinical practice: analysis of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase alone compared with modified Light's criteria [^86d7ac6e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Modified Light's criteria are widely used to categorise pleural fluids as either exudates or transudates. These criteria include fluid/serum ratios and therefore require a blood sample. It is not clear whether analysis of pleural fluid alone would alter pleural fluid categorisation in routine clinical practice. In this study, pleural fluids were categorised using cut-off values for pleural fluid protein (≥ 30 g/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (> 0.45 of upper limit of the serum reference interval) recommended as providing optimal discrimination between transudates and exudates. The resultant categorisations were compared with those produced by application of modified Light's criteria. 77 pleural fluid specimens were included for analysis. Using modified Light's criteria, 32 fluids were categorised as transudates and 45 as exudates. Applying the pleural fluid cut-off values as outlined above, 26 fluids were categorised as transudates and 51 as exudates. Agreement was observed in 71/77 or 92.2% (95% confidence interval 86.2 to 98.2). It was concluded that in most cases, analysis of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase alone produces the same categorisation as modified Light's criteria. Omission of a blood sample rarely affects the categorisation of pleural fluids in routine clinical practice.

### Patient with bilateral pleural effusion: are the findings the same in each fluid? [^1fa0b25b]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with bilateral pleural effusions, the main cellular and biochemical features of the pleural fluid on the right side differ from or correlate with those on the left side. We examined lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, and total protein (TP) levels, RBC count, nucleated cell count (NCC), and differential cell count.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with bilateral pleural effusions, including 13 patients with effusions after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 12 patients with congestive heart failure, 1 patient with malignant pericarditis, and 1 patient with renal failure, were studied retrospectively.

Results

The right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions did not differ in the mean TP (p = 0.38), glucose (p = 0.31), and LDH (p = 0.39) levels, RBC count (p = 0.31), NCC (p = 0.96), and the percentage of neutrophils (p = 0.22), lymphocytes (p = 0.73), mononuclear cells (MNCs) [p = 0.49], and eosinophils (p = 0.65). The bias ± precision was 0.1 ± 0.64 g/dL for TP, - 2.7 ± 23 mg/dL for glucose, 41 ± 362 IU/L for LDH, 6,100 ± 62,900 cells/ micro L for RBC count, - 36 ± 1,043 cells/ micro L for NCC, - 2.9 ± 11.6% for the percentage of neutrophils, 1.15 ± 17% for the percentage of lymphocytes, 2.3 ± 17% for the percentage of the MNCs, and - 0.15 ± 5.4% for the percentage of eosinophils. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions concerning TP level (r = 0.85, p < 0.001), glucose level (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), LDH level (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), RBC count (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), NCC (r = 0.60, p = 0.001), and the percentage of neutrophils (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), lymphocytes (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), MNCs (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), and eosinophils (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Since the pleural fluid findings tend to be similar in both sides of patients with bilateral pleural effusion, we suggest that diagnostic thoracentesis may not need to be performed on both sides, unless there is a specific clinical indication.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^9e162d38]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid analysis, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following approach according to measured pleural fluid pH in patients with suspected complex parapneumonic effusion:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|PH ≤ 7.2|- High risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection < br > - Insert an intercostal drain if the volume of accessible pleural fluid on ultrasound deems the procedure safe|
|PH > 7.2 but < 7.4|- Intermediate risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection < br > - Measure pleural fluid LDH and consider performing intercostal drainage if pleural fluid LDH is > 900 IU/L, especially if other clinical parameters support complex parapneumonic effusion, specifically ongoing temperature, high pleural fluid volume, low pleural fluid glucose (72 mg/dL < br > - ≤ 4.0 mmol/L), and pleural contrast enhancement on CT or septation on ultrasound|
|PH ≥ 7.4|- Low risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection < br > - Do not perform immediate drainage.|

### Biochemical analysis of soft tissue infectious fluids and its diagnostic value in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a 5-year cohort study [^d29cef50]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Most SSTIs result from microbial invasion of the skin through a breach or transient bacteremia following non-penetrating tissue injury. This invasion leads to the release of endotoxins, triggering an inflammatory response that causes fluid extravasation, which becomes trapped between the layers of infected fascia and adjacent tissues. In theory, these soft tissue infectious fluids may contain higher levels of inflammatory markers in patients with NSTI than in those with non-necrotizing SSTI, as NSTIs are generally more severe than non-necrotizing SSTIs. Previous studies have demonstrated that fluid accumulation alone is not sufficiently specific to differentiate NSTIs from non-necrotizing SSTIs. This raises the question of whether the biochemical characteristics of these soft tissue infectious fluids could provide further diagnostic information.

EBF analysis can provide valuable information for the differential diagnosis and is widely used to assess pleural effusion, ascites, synovial fluid, and pericardial fluid. For example, pleural effusions are typically classified as transudates or exudates. Exudates result from increased capillary permeability, allowing proteins and other serum constituents to leak into the fluid, usually due to infections or inflammatory conditions. Conversely, transudative effusions, which are often associated with non-inflammatory conditions, result from increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased plasma oncotic pressure, leading to the accumulation of fluids with low protein content. Several biomarkers have been identified as useful in EBF analysis for distinguishing exudative fluids from transudative fluids, as well as between infectious fluids from non-infectious fluids: (1) The levels of LDH, a marker of cellular injury or inflammation, are typically higher in exudates. An LDH level of > 1000 IU/L was considered to indicate complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, (2) Exudative fluids often exhibit significantly lower glucose and pH levels, especially in the presence of bacterial infection, (3) Total protein and albumin levels are typically elevated in exudative fluids due to increased capillary permeability and inflammatory conditions, and (4) The levels of lactate, a product of anaerobic glycolysis, are often elevated in infection-related conditions. However, studies investigating the biochemical characteristics or diagnostic value of soft tissue infectious fluids are limited. The present study evaluated these biochemical markers in soft tissue infectious fluids, and the results demonstrated significant differences in the levels of albumin, lactate, LDH, glucose, total protein, and pH between the NSTI and non-necrotizing SSTI groups. These findings support the hypothesis that soft tissue infectious fluids in patients with NSTI differ from those in patients with non-necrotizing SSTI, possibly due to differences in infection severity and tissue damage.

### Clinical significance of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion [^2a9402a6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Comparison of basic characteristics and laboratory indicators among patients in TPE, PPE, and MPE groups

The patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics are shown in Table 1. The age at onset was lowest in the TPE group (38.74 ± 19.22 years) and highest in the MPE group (60.99 ± 13.04 years), with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). The white blood cell count was lowest in the TPE group (5.93 × 10⁹ /L) and highest in the PPE group (11.74 × 10⁹ /L); that in the MPE group showed a slight increase (P < 0.001). The median CRP level (120.00 mg/L) and ESR (74 mm/h) in the PPE group were significantly higher than those in the TPE group, and those in the MPE group were lowest among all three groups (P < 0.001). The serum albumin level was lowest in the PPE group (median, 32.6 g/L). The absolute value of serum lymphocytes was lowest in the TPE group (1.18 × 10 9 /L) and highest in the PPE group (1.51 × 10 9 /L).

### Pleural fluid biomarkers to predict response to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for malignant pleural effusion: still a long way to go [^99e9a039]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers for chemical pleurodesis outcome

Most studies on pleural fluid predictors have focused on the success rate of chemical pleurodesis. In 2020, Hassan et al. published a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the predictors of chemical pleurodesis outcomes in patients with MPE. This systematic review encompassed 34 studies, and the meta-analysis incorporated data from 26 studies comprising 3,264 participants. Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenases (LDH), glucose, pH, and neutrophil levels were identified as prognostic biomarkers. We further identified studies that focused on specific proteins. Table 1 provides an overview of the findings, including the assessment of biomarker model quality.

Table 1
Pleural fluid biomarker for pleurodesis success: biomarkers identified, number of studies, positive association to successful intervention, and status on biomarker model validation

ADA: adenosine deaminase, CD163: cluster of differentiation 163, CRP: C-reactive protein, FGF: fibroblast growth factor, IL-8: interleukin-8, LDH: lactate dehydrogenases, sCD163: soluble CD163 scavenger receptor, sVEGFR: soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, TGF-β1: transforming growth factor-β1, uPA: urokinase-type plasminogen activator, VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor

Pleural fluid LDH has been investigated as a biomarker in one retrospective and two prospective studies. The pooled results from the 232 patients showed that lower LDH levels were associated with pleurodesis success with a mean difference between the success and failure groups of -728 IU/L (95% CI -1499 to -43, p = 0.064, I 2 95.5%, p < 0.001) 9. Neither study included clinical variables or a validation cohort (Table 1).

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^078768b0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions are a common problem in cancer patients. In a postmortem series published by Rodriguez-Panadero and colleagues, there was evidence of malignant pleural involvement in 28% of patients with one or more malignant tumors, of whom approximately one-half presented with a pleural effusion. The incidence of malignant pleural effusions in the United States approaches 150,000 cases annually.

For patients presenting with clinical signs of a pleural effusion, the primary diagnostic tools include roentgenographic studies of the chest and a thoracentesis. Initial information about the pleural effusion comes from the color and appearance of the fluid obtained during thoracentesis. Additional information concerning the inflammatory characteristics of the fluid is obtained later, using indicators such as white and red blood cell counts, and chemical laboratory values including glucose, protein, LDH, amylase, and cholesterol.

A small number of previous publications have attempted to find an association between pleural fluid appearance and cytological diagnosis in patients presenting with a pleural effusion. Two studies on patients without a prior diagnosis of cancer reported an association between bloody effusions and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology. In a study of patients with parapneumonic or infection-related effusions, a fluid that was free-flowing and non-purulent indicated an infection that could be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas a fluid with a purulent appearance indicted the need for drainage of the affected pleural cavity.

To our knowledge, there are no publications in the medical literature evaluating the relationship between fluid appearance and the results of cytological evaluation and chemical laboratory testing of pleural effusions in patients with cancer. We therefore conducted a retrospective study in a population of cancer patients with a high pretest probability of having a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) to answer two questions: Is there any relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology? Does fluid appearance correlate with cellular counts or chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions?

### Peritoneal and pleural fluid chemistry measurements performed on three chemistry platforms [^0ecd0283]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chemistry testing is requested for body fluid (BF) specimens despite the lack of assays approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The criteria for categorizing fluids as transudate or exudate are not validated across analyzers.

Objective

To compare BF chemical analysis and classification by different analyzers.

Methods

We analyzed 10 pleural and 18 peritoneal fluids with corresponding plasma specimens using the Vitros 5,1 FS; Abbott ARCHITECT ci8200; and Roche Modular P platforms. Total protein (TP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured for pleural fluids. Light's criteria were applied. Albumin was measured for peritoneal specimens, and the plasma-ascites-albumin gradient was calculated.

Results

TP results showed agreement. The Vitros LDH assay produced higher fluid:plasma ratios. Classification by Light's criteria resulted in 1 discrepancy (ARCHITECT). Albumin results showed agreement. There were 2 discrepant gradient interpretations (Vitros).

Conclusions

These data suggest that analyses of pleural and peritoneal fluids using these platforms are diagnostically interchangeable.

### Pleural fluid agitation for improving the microbiologic diagnostic yield in pleural infection: a feasibility study [^d3339459]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Over a 12-months period, this single centre pilot study prospectively recruited patients referred to the chest clinic or presenting to the emergency department of Alexandria main university hospital. The study was conducted in accordance with the revised declaration of Helsinki, with the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee at Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05702580, 23/12/2022.

The study included 30 adult patients with pleural infection based on clinical presentation, imaging, laboratory investigations and pleural fluid examination showing glucose < 40 mg/dL or pH < 7.2 with lower respiratory infection or pus on aspiration, in the presence of at least a moderate amount of pleural fluid collection defined as fluid spanning at least 2 intercostal spaces on thoracic ultrasound (TUS). Patients with minimal - mild pleural effusion, hemodynamic instability, uncorrected coagulopathy, transudative or exudative lymphocytic pleural effusion on biochemical analysis were excluded. The primary outcome was the difference in the diagnostic yield via microbiologic analysis while the secondary outcome measures were differences in pleural fluid biochemical parameters including protein, glucose and LDH levels.

After obtaining written informed consent forms, eligible patients underwent TUS to confirm, quantify and characterize the pleural effusion in terms of echogenicity, presence of swirling and septations and the most appropriate site for thoracentesis. A depth of at least 3 cm between the visceral and parietal pleura in absence of intervening intercostal vessels was considered safe for aspiration and agitation. Using a strict aseptic technique, a 16-18G catheter was introduced into the pleural space under local anaesthesia with aspiration of 30 mL of fluid (10 and 20 mL for standard biochemical and microbiological analysis respectively) using the standard thoracentesis procedure. For the agitation technique, a 20-ml syringe was used, with the catheter in the pleural space, to aspirate and rapidly flush the fluid back into the pleural space for 3–5 consecutive cycles before another 30 mL of agitated fluid was finally drawn into the collection syringe. Samples collected for microbiological examination, using either sampling techniques, were promptly inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles before being coded and sent to the blinded local in-hospital microbiology lab. Samples were processed and subjected to standard Gram staining, direct culture on standard aerobic and anaerobic microbiological media. The results were evaluated after 48 h and 72 h and time to positivity was recorded when growth was noted. Similar coded samples were subjected to biochemical analysis.

Analysis of the pleural fluid showed that it had a pH of 7.471, cell count of 1850/µL, protein of 4.9 g/dL, albumin of 2.9 g/dL, glucose of 109 mg/dL and adenosine deaminase of 11.8, indicating its exudative nature. Pleural fluid cytology indicated no malignant cells. Analysis of the pericardial effusate showed a pH of 7.477, cell count of 2125/µL, protein of 4.7 g/dL, albumin of 2.6 g/dL and glucose of 102 mg/dL. Cytology of the pericardial effusate also showed no malignant cells. Culture of pericardial and pleural effusions grew no pathogens. Urinalysis showed no proteinuria. Nuclear scintigraphy imaging (99mTc-human serum albumin [HSA]) showed no evidence of protein-losing gastroenteropathy (figure 3). Biopsy specimens of the pleura and pericardium showed fibrous hyperplasia with sporadic inflammatory cell invasion (figure 4A, B).

### Pleural fluid agitation for improving the microbiologic diagnostic yield in pleural infection: a feasibility study [^4af4f1f0]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

About 46.6% of patients had a positive pleural fluid culture result, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. When comparing the agitated pleural fluid sampling technique to standard methods, there was generally no significant discordance in yield as depicted in Figure 1. However, there were two exceptions: one case where the agitated sample identified Klebsiella pneumoniae not found in the standard sample, and another where the agitated sample detected an additional anaerobic bacterial growth. No correlation was found between different sonographic or biochemical characteristics of pleural fluid and culture positivity or time to culture positivity. The organisms detected among positive pleural fluid samples are demonstrated in Figure 2.

Fig. 1

Fig. 2
Different organisms detected in positive pleural fluid cultures

Among those with concordant positive pleural cultures, 30.8% (4/13) showed evidence of higher bacterial growth in the agitated samples compared to the standard samples when assessed using semi-quantitative scoring methods. Regarding the biochemical analysis of pleural fluid, the average protein levels were 4.68 g/dL and 4.53 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were 7099 U/L and 7376.7 U/L, and glucose levels were 68.4 mg/dL and 75.4 mg/dL in the standard and agitated samples, respectively.

### A retrospective study on the combined biomarkers and ratios in serum and pleural fluid to distinguish the multiple types of pleural effusion [^3dfe657d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Differentiating TPE from other causes of PE

(1) TPE versus (vs) MPE To distinguish TPE from MPE (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1, and Additional file 1: Fig. S1), ADA, WBC/ADA, and WBC levels were investigated, and significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed. According to the ROC curve, the AUC values were 0.993 for both ADA (> 19.5 U/L) and WBC/ADA (≤ 271.8). The sensitivity of both ADA and WBC/ADA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] was 89.4–100%), and the specificity of both was 92.0% (95% CI 74.0–99.0%). With both positive likelihood ratios (LR+) greater than 10 and negative likelihood ratios (LR-) less than 0.1, both ADA (> 19.5 U/L) and WBC/ADA (≤ 271.8) can provide highly credible positive and negative results.

### Closed pleural needle biopsy: predicting diagnostic yield by examining pleural fluid parameters [^0c3aae46]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Pleural fluid parameters that predict a diagnostic closed pleural needle biopsy were investigated.

Design

A retrospective analysis.

Setting

The Institute of Pulmonology, Hadassah University Hospital.

Patients and Methods

Forty-four patients who underwent closed pleural needle biopsies were included in this study. Pleural fluid values of protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pH, and white blood cell count with differential cell counts, from patients with diagnostic and non-diagnostic pleural biopsies were compared.

Results

Thirteen patients (29%) had diagnostic biopsies. Malignancy was identified in 10 patients (23%), of whom 70% had adenocarcinoma. Three other patients had non-malignant specific diagnosis. LDH levels in pleural fluid from patients with diagnostic pleural biopsy were higher than in patients with non-diagnostic pleural biopsies (1436 ± 333 U l(-1) vs. 775 ± 109 U l(-1); P < 0.05). LDH levels less than 510 U l(-1) were highly predictive of a negative biopsy (negative predictive value of 86.6%). Follow up revealed malignancy including mesothelioma and lymphoma, in 10 of 30 (33%) patients with non-diagnostic biopsies, and one patient died of unrelated cause, while the pleural effusion either resolved, remained stable or an alternative benign process was identified in 19 patients (63%).

Conclusions

Low levels of LDH (< 510 U l(-1)) were highly predictive of a negative pleural needle biopsy. Thus, LDH may serve as a useful guide in deciding whether to perform closed pleural biopsy or to proceed to thoracoscopically guided biopsy.

(7) MPE vs PE caused by CTDs Statistically significant difference in only the PF-LDH levels between the PE caused by CTDs and MPE groups was observed (AUC = 0.895) (P < 0.01) (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S7, and Additional file 1: Fig. S7). At a cutoff value of > 206.0 U/L, PF-LDH showed 76.0% (95% CI 54.9–90.6%) sensitivity and 87.5% (95% CI 47.3–99.7%) specificity.

(8) CPPE vs UPPE On comparing the CPPE and UPPE groups (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S8, and Additional file 1: Fig. S8), ADA (> 19.5 U/L), PF-LDH (> 586.0 U/L), PF-LDH/Glu (> 157.6), and ADA/Glu (> 3.6) were all found to show high AUC values (> 0.94), with high sensitivities (> 84%) and specificities (> 88%).

(9) CPPE vs PE caused by CTDs To distinguish CPPE from PE caused by CTDs (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S9, and Additional file 1: Fig. S9), CRP (> 19.3 mg/L), PF-LDH (> 354.0 U/L), WBC/PF-LDH (≤ 13.1), CRP/Glu (> 3.4), and PF-LDH/Glu (> 59.4) were all shown to have the best diagnostic performances (AUC = 1), with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

(10) UPPE vs PE caused by CTDs Significant difference in only the CRP levels between the PE caused by CTDs and UPPE groups was observed (AUC = 0.871) (P < 0.01) (Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S10, and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). At a cutoff value of > 9.74 mg/L, CRP showed 85.0% (95% CI 62.1–96.8%) sensitivity and 85.7% (95% CI 42.1–99.6%) specificity.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^542a7a66]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospectively recruited cohort of patients presenting with parapneumonic effusions, high pleural suPAR could predict the insertion of a chest tube with an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.98). It could predict the presence or development of loculations with considerable accuracy. A high pleural suPAR was also indicative of the referral for intrapleural fibrinolytics and/or thoracic surgery and was superior to conventional pleural fluid biomarkers.

The optimal management of parapneumonic effusions is contentious and the topic of several ongoing research studies. Much of the uncertainty relates to the difficulty of predicting which patients require formal drainage of their effusion and which will resolve with conservative management (antibiotics) alone. Guidelines recommend formal drainage in the case of frank pus or a positive Gram stain/culture of pleural fluid. Given low culture rates of fluid from complex parapneumonic effusions, formal drainage is also recommended if the pleural fluid pH is less than 7.2. This threshold was first suggested by Light and colleagues in 1980 after a case series of 90 patients showed that low pH effusions (n = 10) tended to need chest tube drainage. In 1995, Heffner and colleagues performed an elegant meta-analysis of the studies relating to the topic of using pleural pH, glucose, or LDH in distinguishing complicated and uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. From the seven included studies (251 patients) they concluded that pleural pH was the best performing analyte at a cutoff of 7.21. However, they also recognized that given the observational nature of the seven studies and the fact that this analyte had become "entrenched in clinical practice", it required "validation in well-designed prospective studies". pH falls due to lactic acid and 2 by bacteria within the pleural space. Although indicating the presence of bacteria it is prone to both false positives and negatives in the need for invasive pleural management, it has never been prospectively validated in this regard.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^acc802af]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Results

Over the study period, 998 patients underwent PF aspiration with multiple diagnoses (see appendix 1). In total, 325/998 patients (32.6%) were diagnosed with MPE by any definition, and 230/325 (70.1%) of these had malignant cells in PF or tissue samples. Table 1 provides details on the underlying malignancy.

Table 1
Type of cancer causing MPE and method of diagnosis

Transudative effusions

In total, 223 patients with confirmed MPE had samples send for biochemical analysis of which, 7/223 (3.14% 95% CI 0.9% to 5.4%) had biochemistry consistent with transudate. Of these, the median LDH was 117 IU/L (IQR 80–136) and protein was 25 g/L (IQR 20–28), two were systemically unwell, two had liver disease, one had congestive cardiac failure and two patients did not have any underlying diseases to suggest a transudative pathology.

Utility of the initial aspiration sample or radiology to guide management

In 152 patients (46.7%), cytological examination was requested to provide diagnostic information to guide management. Twelve underwent concurrent pleural biopsies and were excluded, leaving 140 patients. Of these 140 patients, 78 (55.7%) had positive cytology (71 on first aspiration) and this information was sufficient to guide management in 45/71 (63.4%) of cytology positive cases. The initial aspiration was sufficient to guide management in 45/140 (32.1%) of the total number of MPE cases (see table 2 for details).

Table 2
Details of treatment decisions

Baseline clinical (demographic) and radiological features were assessed to determine predictors of positive cytology, and sufficiency to guide management (tables 3 and 4). Contemporaneous CT scans were available in 135 cases of confirmed MPE. Pleural thickening and nodularity were negatively associated with positive PF cytology on initial sampling whereas the presence of lymphangitis was associated with positive PF cytology.

Table 3
Positive cytology related to gender and CT scan features

Table 4
Actionable cytology related to gender and CT scan features

Due to the known low sensitivity of fluid cytology in the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, the analysis was repeated excluding mesothelioma cases (n = 43). The negative predictive value of pleural thickening for cytology positivity remained (χ² 1df = 11.66, p = 0.001).

### The large language model diagnoses tuberculous pleural effusion in pleural effusion patients through clinical feature landscapes [^8c8e6b86]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection and variable selection

We selected candidate variables based on key literature on TPE diagnosis models and our clinical experience. These variables were chosen for their clinical availability and non-surgical nature. The potential diagnostic variables included the following clinical characteristics: age, sex, routine PE parameters (color, turbidity, specific gravity, and Leifant test), biochemical parameters of PE (total protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), adenosine deaminase (ADA), and albumin), serum biochemical parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), complete blood count [(white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, neutrophils], and tumor markers [carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), non-small cell lung cancer-related antigen, neuron-specific enolase (NSE)], among others. Samples were sourced from peripheral blood, PE, or pleural tissue collected during hospitalization. We collected clinical data from eligible patients using a structured data sheet customized for this study. These clinical data were obtained from the patients' discharge records. Two experienced pulmonologists reviewed, refined, and cross-checked the clinical data. All data were collected by research staff who were blinded to the final outcome measurements.

### New criteria for the differentiation between transudates and exudates [^b56eaa1e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether cholesterol and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurements in fluids are more sensitive and specific markers for differentiating between exudates and transudates, as confirmed clinically, than the measurement of fluid total protein concentrations alone.

Patients/Methods

Serum, pleural fluid, and ascitic fluid from 61 unselected patients were analysed retrospectively for LDH, cholesterol, and total protein. Clinical classification of transudate or exudate was reached independently by reviewing clinical details and laboratory data.

Results

Of 54 samples (40 pleural fluid and 14 ascitic fluid), 30 were classified clinically as exudates and 24 as transudates. Fluid LDH and fluid to serum protein ratio measurements were equally good at differentiating between exudates and transudates, with a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 79%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 86%. A combination of these parameters improved sensitivity to 100% and NPV to 100%, but lowered the specificity to 71% and PPV to 81%. This combination achieved a higher efficiency than Light's criteria.

Conclusion

Routine measurement of fluid LDH values and the calculation of fluid to serum total protein ratios will aid in differentiating exudates from transudates.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^56fc1161]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 — Management of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)-related pleural space infection without tunnel tract infection states: In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection without a concomitant tunnel tract infection, we suggest attempting continuous fluid drainage through the IPC over catheter removal (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Pleural space infections are generally reported to occur with < 5% of IPCs, and an IPC-related pleural space infection is suggested to exist when any of the following are present: obvious pus drained from the catheter; clinical symptoms with positive pleural fluid gram stain or cultures; or clinical symptoms with pleural fluid biochemical analysis supportive of infection, such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low glucose or low pH, and catheter colonization alone should not define infection. Evidence cited includes a 2013 retrospective analysis of 1021 patients with IPCs at 11 international centers with 50 IPC-related pleural infections; all patients were initially treated with antibiotics and catheter drainage; among infected patients, 74% were treated as inpatients, 3/50 died before infection resolution, with a 94% overall rate of infection control; catheter removal was performed in 46% of patients and reinsertion of a chest tube or IPC was required in 48% of those requiring removal, with no surgical interventions necessary. Additional cohorts included 25, 19, and 13 IPCs respectively, and another series of 672 patients with IPC for MPEs identified 25 IPC-related pleural infections with 60% treated as inpatients and 3/25 deaths within 30 days of infection.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase to adenosine deaminase ratio for tuberculous pleural effusion: an analysis of two cohorts [^9294e305]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous studies usually adopt 35 U/L as a threshold for TPE diagnosis, which was also endorsed by the guideline. Therefore, we used this threshold to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ADA in this study. The sensitivity and specificity of PF ADA in the BUFF cohort were 0.47 and 0.86, respectively. While in the SIMPLE cohort, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.61 and 0.92, respectively, which are lower than those reported by the previous studies and meta-analyses. This inconsistency can be partially explained by the age of participants in our study. The median ages of participants in the BUFF and the SIMPLE cohorts were 68 years and 72 years, respectively, which is higher than that in previous studies. Some previous studies also revealed that age could affect the diagnostic accuracy of PF ADA for TPE, and the diagnostic accuracy of ADA decreased in old patients.

Although this is the first study investigating the added diagnostic value of PF LDH/ADA, it has some limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the BUFF cohort and the small sample size may bias the results. Second, the diagnosis of TPE and non-TPE was based on the different reference standards, termed differential verification bias. This design weakness may overestimate the diagnostic accuracy of LDH/ADA ratio and ADA. However, differential verification bias is common in diagnostic test accuracy studies investigating PF biomarkers. Third, this study did not investigate factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of ADA and LDH/ADA ratio because of the small sample size. Fourth, two ADA assays were used in this work. It is unclear whether the ADA assay can affect the ADA value and its diagnostic accuracy.

### Is albumin gradient or fluid to serum albumin ratio better than the pleural fluid lactate dehydroginase in the diagnostic of separation of pleural effusion? [^c0fb9d4e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the accuracy of serum-effusion albumin gradient (SEAG) and pleural fluid to serum albumin ratio (ALBR) in the diagnostic separation of pleural effusion into transudate and exudate and to compare SEAG and ALBR with pleural fluid LDH (FLDH) the most widely used test.

Methods

Data collected from 200 consecutive patients with a known cause of pleural effusion in a United Kingdom district general hospital.

Results

The median and inter quartile ranges (IQR) for SEAG 93.5 (33.8 to 122.5) g/dl, ALBR 0.49 (0.42 to 0.62) and FLDH 98.5 IU/L(76.8 to 127.5) in transudates were significantly lower than the corresponding values for exudates 308.5 (171 to 692), 0.77 (0.63 to 0.85), 344 (216 to 695) all p < 0.0001. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) for SEAG, ALBR and FLDH were 0.81 (0.75 to 0.87), 0.79 (0.72 to 0.86) and 0.9 (0.87 to 0.96) respectively. The positive likelihood ratios with 95%CI for FLDH, SEAG, and ALBR were: 7.3(3.5–17), 6.3(3–15) 6.2(3–14) respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between SEAG and ALBR (r = -0.89, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The discriminative value for SEAG and ALBR appears to be similar in the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates. FLDH is a superior test compared to SEAG and ALBR.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^f7b6f538]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To obtain the maximum diagnostic yield from the measurement of tumour markers in pleural effusions, we support simultaneous determination of markers in fluid and serum with a low cut-off point in patients in whom no increases in TM due to benign disease are suspected (i.e. with ADA, CRP and PN% below the discriminant values). In patients in whom increases in TM due to benign disease are suspected, the strategy of a single determination in fluid may offer better diagnostic accuracy.

American Thoracic Society — Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

### Effects of coexisting pneumonia and end-stage renal disease on pleural fluid analysis in patients with hydrostatic pleural effusion [^d727266d]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In individual patients, especially those who are hospitalized, several conditions often coexist that may be responsible for the development of a pleural effusion and may affect the pleural fluid analysis (PFA). The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of end-stage renal disease and pneumonia on PFA in patients with hydrostatic pleural effusion.

Methods

In a retrospective analysis of 1,064 consecutive patients who underwent thoracentesis at a university hospital, cell counts and pleural fluid protein, lactate dehydrogenase, pH, and glucose levels were examined in those (n = 300) with clinical evidence of hydrostatic pleural effusion.

Results

The 300 patients (28.1%) with pleural effusions had congestive heart failure (CHF), circulatory overload (CO), or both. Expert consensus was achieved in 66 (22%) for CHF as the sole diagnosis (SCHF), 30 (10%) for CHF and coexisting pneumonia (PCHF), and 26 (8.7%) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with coexisting CO or CHF. The remaining 178 patients were excluded because of complicating conditions. There were minor, but statistically significant differences in pleural fluid/serum protein ratios in patients with ESRD with coexisting CO or CHF compared with SCHF. Compared with SCHF, there were statistically significant tendencies for higher protein and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations and lower pH levels in those with PCHF. The total nucleated cell count and the absolute neutrophil count were significantly higher in PCHF.

Conclusions

ESRD in patients with hydrostatic pleural effusions has a minimal effect on the PFA. Coexisting pneumonia most often results in an exudative effusion in patients with CHF.

### The pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio differentiates between tuberculous and parapneumonic pleural effusions [^87ae5aba]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Data for a total of 72 patients with TPE and 47 with PPE were reviewed (Additional file 1: Excel). The data for the TPE patients revealed 4 who had positive MTB cultures (3 in pleural fluid, 2 in sputum), 4 with pleural fluid TB-DNA, and 1 who was positive on acid-fast bacillus (AFB) testing. Among the PPE patients, bacterial pathogens were identified in 10 cases (3 in pleural fluid, 2 in sputum, and 1 in blood 1), including streptococci in 4 patients and staphylococci in 3. In addition, 23 UPPE, 15 CPPE, and 9 empyema cases were respectively identified (according to the definitions specified above).

Clinical and laboratory findings in the patients with TPE and PPE are shown in Table 1. The TPE and PPE groups had median ages of 51.5 years (range,17–82 years) and 59.0 years (range, 26–93 years), respectively (P < .05), and the male sex percentages in the 2 groups were 68.1% and 75%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that in comparison with the PPE group, the TPE group had an increased pleural fluid protein level (P < .05), but a significantly lower pleural fluid LDH level (P < .001). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in blood albumin and blood LDH levels, or in pleural fluid ADA levels (Table 1). However, the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio in the TPE group was significantly lower than in the PPE group, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) for identifying TPE were, respectively, 93.62%, 93.06%, 13.48, and 0.068 at a cut-off level of 16.20 (Fig. 1).

✱ p value (unadjusted), Chi-square ≤ .10 = statistically significant variables; ECOG: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; CI: Confidence Interval.

Patients with an ECOG PS grade of 0 had the longest median survival (55 months), while those with a grade of 1, 2, 3, or 4 had a median survival of 22, 18, 7, and 1 month, respectively (Table 4). Patients with pleural effusion and ovarian cancer had the best median survival (21 months) compared with those with other primary tumors. The medial survival of patients with breast cancer was 6 months, and those with either lung cancer or lymphoma had a median survival of 4 months (Tables 3 and 4).

Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that ECOG PS (HR 73.58, p < 0.0001) was the only independent prognostic factor affecting the survival of patients with MPE (Table 5). If the regression coefficient of the prognostic factor was positive, the risk of death (hazard) was higher (e.g. patients with higher values had a worse prognosis (Table 5). Patients with an ECOG score of 4 had worse survival than those with a better PS (ECOG score of 1 or 2), as shown by the Kaplan–Meier curve (Figure 2).

### Prognostic significance of pleural fluid microbiological positivity in pleural infection: a bicentric 10-year retrospective observational study [^57695e3f]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective observational study which recruited patients in two acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong (Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital [PYNEH] and Ruttonjee Hospital [RH]). Adult patients admitted for pleural infection in the two hospitals over a 10-year period (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020) were identified in a territory-wide healthcare electronic database (Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System) using the relevant discharge diagnosis codes consistent with parapneumonic effusion and empyema (ICD-9 codes 510.0, 510.9, 511.0 and 511.1). Exclusion criteria included (1) duplicated records, (2) no pleural fluid for analysis, (3) uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion not fulfilling the definition of pleural infection, (4) tuberculous pleuritis, and (5) pleural effusion of other causes.

Patients were included if they had a clinical presentation consistent with pleural infection, and any of the following criteria: (1) pleural fluid that was frank pus; or (2) pleural fluid that was positive on Gram staining or culture for bacteria; or (3) pleural fluid with a pH ≤ 7.2; or (4) pleural fluid with a low glucose level (≤ 2.2 mmol/l) or (5) contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) evidence of pleural infection (consolidation of underlying lung with enhancing pleural collection) in a patient with clinical evidence of infection, alongside exclusion of other sources of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed by the investigators based on the presence of fever, an elevated peripheral white blood cell (WBC), or elevated serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). As the standard practice in the two participating hospitals, in patients with suspected pleural infection undergoing thoracentesis or drainage, the appearance of pleural fluid was documented routinely (pus or non-pus), and the pleural fluid was sent for gram staining and culture in plain bottle (without the use of blood culture bottle). Other pleural fluid analysis including pleural pH and glucose were arranged at the discretion of treating physician, if fluid volume is adequate.

Values are medians (range)

Management of pleural effusion is usually initiated after determining its transudative or exudative nature and comparing pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum LDH levels according to Light's criteria. Clinical practice guidelines endorse the use of pleural fluid LDH and glucose to assist in the classification of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE). However, an elevated pleural fluid LDH may present in TPE, PPE, and MPE, and the level is likely to range greatly from normal to extremely increased, which limits the use of LDH for identifying PPE in an individual patient due to the low sensitivity. Therefore, it remains a challenge for clinicians to distinguish between patients with TPE and PPE from elevated pleural fluid ADA and LDH levels. As different mechanisms contribute to the elevation of ADA and LDH, it may be helpful to differentiate TPE from PPE by examining the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio, which has not been investigated in previous studies.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio as a new parameter to discriminate between TPE and PPE.

Results

Characteristics of the participants

Figure 1 is a flowchart of the participants selection procedure. We included 256 patients in the BUFF and 210 patients in the SIMPLE study. The characteristics of the participants are listed in Table 1. In both the SIMPLE and the BUFF cohort, TPE patients had higher PF ADA activity, total protein concentration and lower LDH/ADA ratio than non-TPE patients. We failed to observe any differences in LDH activity between TPE and non-TPE patients.

Diagnostic accuracy of PF ADA and LDH/ADA ratio

Figure 2 presents the ROC curves of PF ADA and LDH/ADA ratio. The AUCs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of ADA and LDH/ADA ratio in the BUFF cohort were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.82) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.67–0.81), respectively (p = 0.67 for AUC comparison). In the SIMPLE cohort, the AUCs of ADA and LDH/ADA ratio were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71–0.90) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76–0.93), respectively (p = 0.28 for AUC comparison). Therefore, the overall diagnostic accuracy of LDH/ADA does not outperform ADA. Figure 3 shows the decision curves of ADA and LDH/ADA. The LDH/ADA ratio did not show a significantly high net benefit over ADA in either the SIMPLE cohort or the BUFF cohort.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^1846c869]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

AABIP indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) pleural space infection — recommendation, diagnostic criteria, and outcomes are summarized as follows. Pleural space infections are generally reported to occur with < 5% of IPCs. For patients with IPCs for known or suspected malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection without a concomitant tunnel tract infection, "we suggest attempting continuous fluid drainage through the IPC over catheter removal". The guideline suggests IPC-related pleural space infection exists when any of the following are present: obvious pus drained from the catheter; clinical symptoms consistent with infection with positive pleural fluid gram stain or cultures; or clinical symptoms consistent with infection plus pleural fluid biochemical support (elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low glucose or low pH), and it notes that positive cultures alone should not define infection due to not infrequent colonization. In a retrospective multicenter series (Fysh et al.), 1021 patients with IPCs across 11 international centers included 50 IPC-related pleural infections; all were initially treated with antibiotics and catheter drainage, 74% were treated as inpatients, 3/50 died before infection resolution, the overall rate of infection control was 94%, and catheter removal was performed in 46% of patients; among those requiring removal, reinsertion of a chest tube or IPC was required in 48% and no surgical interventions were necessary. Additional data include 672 patients with IPCs for MPEs with 25 IPC-related pleural infections identified; among infected patients, 60% were inpatients and 3/25 died within 30 days of infection.

### Characteristics of trapped lung: pleural fluid analysis, manometry, and air-contrast chest CT [^42b1daff]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To review the pleural fluid characteristics, pleural manometry, and radiographic data of patients who received a diagnosis of trapped lung in our pleural diseases service.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

The procedure records of 247 consecutive patients who underwent pleural manometry at the Medical University of South Carolina between October 2002 and November 2005 were reviewed. Eleven patients in whom a diagnostic pneumothorax was introduced were identified. Manometry data, radiographic findings, pleural fluid analysis, final clinical diagnosis, and information regarding the initial pleural insult were retrieved from the medical record.

Results

All 11 patients had a clinical diagnosis of trapped lung. The causes of trapped lung were attributed to coronary artery bypass graft surgery, uremia, thoracic radiation, pericardiotomy, spontaneous bacterial pleuritis and repeated thoracentesis, and complicated parapneumonic effusion. Mean pleural fluid pH was 7.30, pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 124 IU/L, and pleural fluid total protein was 2.9 g/dL. Pleural fluid was paucicellular with mononuclear cell predominance. Pleural space elastance was increased in all cases and ranged from 19 to 149 cm H(2)O/L of pleural fluid removed. All demonstrated abnormal visceral pleural thickness on air-contrast chest CT.

Conclusions

Trapped lung is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of a restrictive visceral pleural peel that was first described in 1967. The pleural fluid is paucicellular, LDH is low, and protein may be in the exudative range. The elevated total pleural fluid protein may be related to factors other than active pleural inflammation or malignancy and does not exclude the diagnosis.

### Body fluid testing at John F. Kennedy medical center in Liberia [^c322a729]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To apply a simple method to validate testing for albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein (TP) in peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) at a hospital in Liberia.

Methods

Serum and body fluid specimens were mixed to create 100% serum and 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% fluid tubes, which were tested on a Biotecnica BT3500. Differences less than 10% between calculated and measured concentrations were considered acceptable.

Results

The means (confidence intervals) of the percent differences were: albumin/peritoneal 12.8 (6.0–19.7), albumin/pleural 2.8 (1.3–4.2), albumin/CSF 4.8 (2.2–7.5), glucose/peritoneal 4.0 (1.9–6.0), glucose/pleural 4.4 (3.1–5.7), glucose/CSF 2.9 (1.8–4.0), LDH/peritoneal 9.5 (6.3–12.7), LDH/pleural 9.5 (5.4–13.6), LDH/CSF 9.2 (5.2–13.3), TP/peritoneal 7.6 (3.8–11.4), TP/pleural 3.8 (1.5–6.2), and TP/CSF 4.5 (1.0–8.1).

Conclusions

All mean differences except for one were less than 10%, allowing for the adoption of clinical testing. The mixing study is a low-cost method for quality-assured testing that can be performed by resource-limited laboratories.

### The diagnostic role of glycosaminoglycans in pleural effusions: a pilot study [^5fe241af]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exudates vs. transudates

Differences among transudates vs. all exudates, numbering 5 and 45 patients respectively, were also studied. Pleural fluid GAGs (pGAG) and the pleural fluid/serum GAG ratio (GAGR) were both significantly higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.001) in the exudate group (Table 4). This was also observed with pleural fluid total protein, pLDH, and LDHR (p < 0.001 for all three parameters). No statistical difference was found in serum GAGs (sGAG); on the contrary values were very close. According to ROC analysis, both GAGR and pGAG exhibited satisfactory discriminative properties. The 1.1 cut off value demonstrated the highest accuracy for GAGR (sensitivity 75.6%; 95%CI: 60.5–87.1; specificity 100%; 95%CI: 47.8–100), whereas a cut off point of 8.4 μg/ml yielded optimum results for pGAG (sensitivity 86.7%; 95%CI: 73.2–94.9; specificity 100%; 95%CI: 47.8–100). Sensitivities and specificities of Light's criteria were also estimated (Table 5).

### Leser-Trélat sign in metastatic melanoma to pleura [^b429621f]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe hypoxaemic respiratory insufficiency.

ECG showed sinus rhythm, with infra-ST in precordial leads and T-wave inversion in V6.

Chest radiography revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. A chest, abdominal and pelvic CT revealed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies, occlusion of the lumen of the bronchi to the right lower lobe and middle lobe and a large pleural effusion on the right side (figure 2), without other alterations.

Figure 2
Chest CT showing bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies, occlusion of the lumen of the bronchi to the right lower lobe and middle lobe and a large pleural effusion on the right side.

Non-invasive ventilation and medical therapy were initiated, although with slow and gradual improvement of the patient's respiratory status.

She was submitted to diagnostic and evacuation thoracentesis, with drainage of 1500 mL of serum-haematic pleural fluid. Pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudate with 59% lymphocytes, glucose 233 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 226 U/L and total protein 4.1 g/dL. Cytology of pleural fluid was negative for neoplastic cells.

Flexible bronchoscopy showed a slight extrinsic compression of the right lower lobe, in basal segments, probably related to pleural effusion, with no other endobronchial changes. The cytology of bronchial aspirate was negative for neoplastic cells.

Pleural biopsy was performed, with histological examination showing a malignant neoplasia composed of epithelioid cells, with diffuse expression of Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor (MiTF).

Biopsy of the right axillary lymph node with immunohistochemical study revealed a differentiated malignant neoplasm compatible with malignant melanoma.

Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with malignant melanoma with pleural metastasis associated with Leser-Trélat signal.

The patient's medical condition rapidly declined and she ultimately succumbed to death before initiation of any therapy.

Learning points

Our case underlines the importance to consider metastatic melanoma in differential diagnosis, especially in dark effusion.
Metastatic pleural melanoma is rare and the association with Leser-Trélat sign is even rarer, and a high index of suspicion in these cases is crucial for rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment, in order to avoid an unfavourable outcome.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^293e2ae3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

### The pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio differentiates between tuberculous and parapneumonic pleural effusions [^5a2c599f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study has provided evidence that the pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio is a useful indicator to distinguish TPE from PPE. The LDH/ADA ratio may also reflect the nature of pleural inflammation and the response to inflammation. Consequently, it may be useful for the early clinical management of patients with pleural effusion.

### Pleural ELFA D-dimer assay: a surrogate marker for malignant pleural effusion [^f8fe0ed2]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant pleural effusion is associated with enhanced fibrinolysis. However, no data are available concerning the precise role of pleural D-dimer assay in pleural effusion. We therefore assessed the role of pleural D-dimer assay in predicting malignant pleural effusion.

Patients and Methods

A prospective laboratory investigation was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. The study included consecutive patients with pleural effusion who presented at the Pulmonary Department between November 2009 and May 2010. Blood and pleural D-dimer levels were measured by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent assay (ELFA). The results were correlated with the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings, and with the final diagnosis of the pleural fluid.

Results

A total of 103 patients with pleural effusion were included in the study. The Pleural ELFA D-dimer results were found to be positively correlated with pleural etiology of malignancy (p = 0.0001). Pleural etiology was also correlated with pleural LDH, pleural protein, pleural PH, pleural glucose, pleural and blood CRP, but not with ADA. In a binary logistic regression, only the pleural ELFA D-dimer assay was a significant predictor of the malignant pleural effusion (odds ratio 1.007; 95% confidence interval 1.002–1.012; p = 0.007). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for malignancy was 0.79. A D-dimer level of 146mg/ml had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 74%.

Conclusions

We found high D-dimer levels among malignant pleural effusion. D-dimer might be useful as a simple, noninvasive, surrogate marker for malignant pleural effusion.

### Predictive factors of morbidity in childhood parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia: a retrospective study [^982a5bb9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To find the clinical and laboratory criteria that best predict a prolonged fever in children with parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia treated conservatively.

Design

Retrospective, cohort study.

Patients

Children admitted to the Shaare Zedek Medical Center between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006, and who had been discharged with a diagnosis of empyema and pleurisy.

Measurements and Results

One hundred-twenty children were included, all of whom were treated with antibiotics; in 80 patients, a thoracic drain was introduced; in 23, pleural tap was performed; and in 17 patients, no special procedure was performed. In no case was video-assisted thoracic surgery performed. The mean total days of fever was 12.8 ± 5.9 (2–29 days), and the mean length of stay at the hospital was 11.5 ± 4.9 (3–25) days. In 44 patients (37%), a bacterial culture was positive either in blood or in pleural fluid or both. A positive blood or a positive pleural fluid culture was significantly associated with a prolonged fever as was a history of an underlying disease. Platelet counts, serum Na, serum protein, pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pleural glucose, pleural/serum LDH ratio, pleural/serum glucose ratio, and pleural fluid pH were the only factors significantly but weakly correlated with the total duration of fever or duration of fever after admission. A "fever duration" score using platelet count, pleural fluid pH, pleural/serum LDH ratio, and pleural/serum glucose ratio predicted a prolonged course of fever (> 7 days) with a sensitivity of 91% (95% confidence interval: 60%-100%) and a specificity of 47% (95% confidence interval: 25%-71%).

Conclusions

In children with parapneumonic effusion-associated pneumonia, a positive bacterial culture and an underlying disease are associated with prolonged fever. A low score based on platelet count, pH pleural fluid and glucose, and LDH pleural/serum ratio is associated with a prolonged fever. We speculate that children with the risk factors mentioned earlier may be the best candidates for an early aggressive approach.

### Clinical significance of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion [^43b3bba4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and usually presents as a pulmonary infection. However, it may also invade extrapulmonary tissues or organs; such cases are called extrapulmonary TB. Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is the second most common form of extrapulmonary TB, second only to lymph node involvement. It is the most common cause of pleural effusion in TB-endemic areas and the most common type of exudative pleural effusion in China.

There is a certain difficulty in the clinical diagnosis of TPE, which relies on bacteriological and histopathological examinations including an acid-fast bacilli smear, rapid molecular tests, and culture of tuberculous bacteria, the latter of which is the gold standard. However, the positive rate of TB smear and culture in pleural effusion is low, and the time required for culture is too long to meet the needs of early clinical diagnosis. The positive detection rate of biopsy by percutaneous pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy is high, but widespread application of this technique is difficult because of its invasiveness, complications such as hemopneumothorax, high cost, and need for highly skilled operators, making the diagnosis of TPE somewhat challenging. Therefore, it is important to find easy, noninvasive, practical, and rapid auxiliary detection means and indicators. Several biomarkers have recently been applied to the diagnosis and differentiation of TPE in China and abroad, including adenosine deaminase (ADA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and several inflammatory cytokines in serum and pleural effusion.

### Paradoxical development of pleural-based masses in patients with pleural tuberculosis during treatment: a clinical observational study in China [^8e89748e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We found ADA and LDH was higher in effusion of patients with pleural-based masses, meanwhile glucose was lower. It had been reported that pleural thickness may be related to lower glucose and higher ADA in pleural effusion, and fluid ADA does play an important role in differentiating TB and malignant pleural effusion. The vast majority of tuberculous pleural effusions are based on high protein, a lymphocytosis and low culture positive rate in pleural effusion. A low pleural fluid glucose level indicates that the patient probably has infectious disease. We noticed that pleural fluid glucose in patients with pleural-based mass was lower than those without occurrence of pleural-based mass, but seemed higher than patients with mixed other bacterial infection we observed in clinics in which pleural glucose can be obviously low (e.g. as low as 0.03 mmol/L), therefore we speculated that lower fluid glucose in the present study did not exclude the possibility of slightly mixed infection. Although protein content of pleural effusions was thought to be related with pleural thickening, however, we found there was no statistical significance between the two groups in the present study. It might be partly due to small size of study or patient selection bias, the study needs the multicenter, large scale sample clinical trial to verify this conclusion in the future. According to the literature, fibrin deposition and loculation of pleural effusions was related to the imbalance of PAI-1 and t-PA in pleural effusion. Pleural inflammation may increase PAI-1 and decrease t-PA in pleural effusion, it can lead to pleural thickening. Although it seemed like higher TGF-β, PAI-1, and PAI-1/t-PA, lower t-PA were observed in fluid from patients with plural-based masses than those patients without pleural-based masses (p < 0.05), these cytokines had no statistical differences after P value correction and re-evaluation. We speculated the reason might be limited numbers in the present study, it will be verified in the future study by larger samples.
