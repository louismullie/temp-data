## Question

2 year old inhaled fabric ball…2 days ago.  Only dry cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a 2-year-old with a witnessed fabric ball inhalation 2 days ago who now has only a dry cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate risk stratification and whether this is an airway emergency. Then, I should verify the diagnostic implications of a witnessed aspiration with a persistent cough. Next, I will review the limitations of chest radiography and the role of bronchoscopy. After that, I need to outline the urgency of intervention and preoperative planning. Finally, I will consider supportive care, what to avoid, and how to counsel the family, while double-checking for any exceptions or nuances that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. A 2-year-old with a witnessed foreign body aspiration and ongoing cough is high risk for retained airway foreign body, and the absence of stridor or respiratory distress does not exclude partial obstruction or distal bronchial involvement, so I should not be reassured by a stable appearance alone [^171f1cfa] [^3f343f00].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic weight of the history. A choking event followed by persistent cough is a classic presentation of foreign body aspiration, and guidelines emphasize that a negative chest radiograph does not exclude a foreign body, so I should not rely on a normal CXR to rule this out in a toddler [^3f343f00] [^9e436c68].

> I will now examine the role of imaging. Chest radiography can show unilateral hyperinflation, atelectasis, or consolidation, but many foreign bodies are radiolucent and early films can be normal, with reported normal CXR rates around 20–42% in suspected aspiration, so a normal CXR cannot safely exclude a retained object in this scenario [^e6969e3f] [^110cc2ff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I initially thought that because it has only been 2 days, complications are unlikely, but I should correct that: early complications can occur within hours to days, and delays in diagnosis beyond a week are associated with higher risks of pneumonia, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis, so even at 48 hours, urgent evaluation is warranted to prevent progression [^5f59e13b] [^7c1e1449].

> Next, I should review the definitive diagnostic and therapeutic step. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold standard for suspected airway foreign body in children, offering both diagnostic confirmation and removal in a controlled setting; flexible bronchoscopy can be adjunctive but is less reliable for extraction of certain objects, so I need to ensure referral for rigid bronchoscopy without delay [^fba026c4] [^171f1cfa].

> Let me consider supportive care while awaiting procedural management. I should avoid cough suppressants because coughing is protective to prevent deeper migration or complete obstruction, and I should avoid sedating antihistamines or decongestants given risks of respiratory depression and lack of benefit in this context; instead, I will focus on hydration, observation for respiratory distress, and clear return precautions [^893520b2] [^7892bac0].

> I should double-check for red flags that would escalate urgency. Any new stridor, drooling, cyanosis, retractions, fever, or worsening cough warrants immediate emergency evaluation and may necessitate emergent airway management; if respiratory compromise occurs, basic life support maneuvers and skilled airway techniques, including Magill forceps, may be required while arranging definitive bronchoscopy [^e7051a34] [^71ff9767].

> But wait, what if the cough resolves spontaneously? Even if symptoms abate, a retained foreign body can cause intermittent obstruction and secondary infection, so I should still advocate for bronchoscopic evaluation given the witnessed aspiration and the potential for delayed complications, and I will document this counseling clearly for the family [^5f59e13b] [^171f1cfa].

> Next, I should review preoperative considerations. The child should be kept NPO once bronchoscopy is planned, and the procedure should be performed in a pediatric-ready facility with anesthesia and otolaryngology or pediatric pulmonology support; I need to ensure the team is prepared for both rigid and flexible approaches depending on object location and characteristics [^fba026c4] [^171f1cfa].

> Finally, I need to ensure the family understands the plan and risks of delay. I will explain that persistent cough after a choking event is a red flag for retained foreign body, that imaging can be normal and cannot exclude it, that bronchoscopy is both diagnostic and curative, and that early removal reduces risks of pneumonia, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis; I will also provide clear return precautions and a direct line for deterioration [^3f343f00] [^5f59e13b].

A 2-year-old with a witnessed fabric ball inhalation 2 days ago and only a dry cough is at **high risk for a retained airway foreign body** [^3f343f00], even if the child appears well and the chest X-ray is normal [^e6969e3f]. A persistent dry cough after a choking event is a classic sign of partial airway obstruction [^3f343f00], and delays in diagnosis can lead to complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or bronchiectasis [^5f59e13b]. Immediate evaluation by a pediatric pulmonologist or ENT is indicated, and **rigid bronchoscopy is the gold standard** for both diagnosis and removal [^fba026c4] [^171f1cfa]. Do not use cough suppressants or delay care, as the foreign body may migrate and cause complete obstruction or infection [^171f1cfa].

## Clinical significance of a persistent dry cough after foreign body aspiration

A persistent dry cough following a witnessed choking episode is a **classic sign of partial airway obstruction** from a retained foreign body [^3f343f00]. Cough is the most common symptom in pediatric foreign body aspiration, occurring in up to 88% of cases [^3f343f00]. Even if the child appears well and has no respiratory distress, a retained foreign body can cause ongoing irritation, inflammation, and secondary infection [^5f59e13b].

---

## Potential complications of delayed diagnosis and management

Delaying diagnosis and management of a retained airway foreign body can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Pneumonia**: Persistent obstruction can cause localized infection and inflammation [^5f59e13b].

- **Atelectasis**: Partial or complete obstruction can lead to lung collapse [^5f59e13b].

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic obstruction and infection can cause permanent airway damage [^5f59e13b].

- **Respiratory distress**: Migration of the foreign body can cause complete obstruction, leading to acute respiratory failure [^171f1cfa].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

Given the high risk of complications, a **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history and physical examination | Identify specific cough pointers, such as choking history, unilateral wheeze, or decreased breath sounds [^3f343f00] [^1617c4c2] |
| 2 | Chest radiography (CXR) | Initial imaging to identify radiopaque foreign bodies or secondary signs (hyperinflation, atelectasis) [^110cc2ff] |
| 3 | Inspiratory and expiratory CXR or decubitus films | Identify air trapping or mediastinal shift suggestive of foreign body aspiration [^110cc2ff] |
| 4 | Flexible or rigid bronchoscopy | Gold standard for definitive diagnosis and removal of foreign body [^fba026c4] [^171f1cfa] |

---

## Limitations of chest radiography

Chest radiography has limited sensitivity and specificity for detecting airway foreign bodies, particularly radiolucent materials such as fabric [^e6969e3f]. Normal CXR findings do not exclude foreign body aspiration, and **additional imaging or bronchoscopy may be required** if clinical suspicion remains high [^9e436c68].

---

## Indications for bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is indicated in any child with a **history of choking and persistent respiratory symptoms**, including cough, wheeze, or recurrent pneumonia [^1bb14792]. Rigid bronchoscopy is the gold standard for both diagnosis and removal of airway foreign bodies, particularly in young children [^fba026c4] [^171f1cfa].

---

## Management and follow-up

Immediate management involves **urgent referral to a pediatric pulmonologist or ENT specialist** for bronchoscopic evaluation and foreign body removal [^171f1cfa]. Supportive care includes hydration, humidified air, and close monitoring for respiratory distress. Follow-up should ensure resolution of symptoms and assess for complications such as infection or airway injury [^5f59e13b].

---

## Parental counseling and education

Parents should be counseled on the **risks of delayed diagnosis**, the importance of immediate medical evaluation, and the potential complications of untreated foreign body aspiration. They should also be educated on choking prevention strategies and basic life support techniques for future incidents [^e7051a34].

---

A 2-year-old with a witnessed fabric ball inhalation and persistent dry cough requires **urgent evaluation and bronchoscopic removal** of the foreign body. Delays increase the risk of pneumonia, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis, and normal imaging does not exclude aspiration [^5f59e13b] [^e6969e3f].

In addition, some cough and cold medicines can have serious side effects, such as slowed breathing, which can be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children. For those reasons, it’s important to know when your child needs medication, which treatments are recommended, and when to do without medicine. These days, cold and cough symptoms can be especially worrisome, because they could be symptoms of COVID-19, the flu, or other potentially serious illness. If you are concerned about COVID-19, talk to your child’s health care provider. Ways to Treat Colds in Infants and Children Coughs are a normal symptom of a cold and help the body clear the mucus out of the airway and protect the lungs. Non-drug treatments for coughs include drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm drinks to soothe the throat. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration offers these tips for relieving cough and cold symptoms in infants and children: .

A makes breathing easier by decreasing congestion in nasal passages. Do not use warm mist humidifiers because they can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult. cool mist humidifier keep nasal passages moist and help avoid stuffiness. Saline nose drops or sprays or a similar product, with or without saline nose drops, works very well for children younger than a year old. You can use them on older children, too, but they often resist bulb syringes. Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe. can be used to reduce fever, aches, and pain. Carefully read and follow the product’s instructions on the Drug Facts label or talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about dosage.

In certain instances, children younger than 4 who took these products have experienced serious side effects, some of which required hospitalization, including:
- Seizure, allergic reaction, and difficulty breathing.
- Low blood potassium and low blood sugar, which may result in headache, crankiness, drowsiness, and weakness. These serious side effects occurred soon after children took a homeopathic cough and cold product; however, it is not always possible to know whether a reported side effect was caused by a medicine.
- Severe headache.
- Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration.
- Excessive crankiness or sleepiness.

### The child with an incessant dry cough [^c322b6d3]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Cough is a forced expulsive manoeuvre, usually against a closed glottis and is associated with a characteristic sound that is easily recognised. It is a protective reflex against aspiration and to clear airway secretions. In children cough is extremely common and when prolonged it is often a cause for concern for parents, resulting in a high proportion of attendances to primary and secondary care. There are many causes of cough which may be divided into productive or non-productive in character. As there are many guidelines for the management of productive or 'wet' cough the focus of this paper will be to discuss some of the main causes, investigations and management options for 'dry' cough. Dry coughing suggests airway irritation and or inflammation (without excessive extra secretion formation) and is predominantly the result of an acute viral respiratory infection that may last up to 3-4 weeks.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^66aa9dd3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough—at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with ‘expected cough.’ ‘Expected cough’ refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as ‘specific cough.’ In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Cough [^f5909817]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema from bronchial foreign body aspiration [^c5d52312]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2012). Low credibility.

Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare presentations of an airway foreign body. Only a handful of other cases have been reported in the English literature. We present a case of a 2 year old female who presented with wheezing and a dry cough. Following a breathing treatment with a non-rebreather mask, she developed right sided facial subcutaneous emphysema. The following day, after an episode of crying, the subcutaneous emphysema rapidly progressed to involve the anterior chest wall, shoulders, neck and face. Rigid bronchoscopy was emergently performed and a ball-valving, soft foreign body was removed from the right bronchus. A chest tube was placed, and the patient was successfully extubated the following day. When faced with a pediatric patient presenting with subcutaneous emphysema or pneumomediastinum of unknown origin, the pediatrician and otolaryngologist should consider the possibility of an airway foreign body. Management involves emergent airway evaluation in the operating room, removal of the foreign body, placement of a chest tube if pneumomediastinum is present, and supportive care with reflux medications and intravenous steroids.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1e76e08e]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms to general practitioners. The objective of this article is to collate the pediatric components of the CHEST chronic cough guidelines that have recently updated the 2006 guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methods

We reviewed all current CHEST Expert Cough Panel's statements and extracted recommendations and suggestions relating to children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration). Additionally, we undertook systematic reviews to update other sections we considered relevant and important.

Results

The eight recent CHEST guidelines relevant to children, based on systematic reviews, reported some high-quality evidence in the management of chronic cough in children (eg, use of algorithms and management of wet/productive cough using appropriate antibiotics). However, much evidence is still inadequate, particularly in the management of non-specific cough in the community.

Conclusions

The recommendations and suggestions related to the management of chronic cough in the pediatric age group have been based upon high-quality systematic reviews and are summarized in this article. Compared to the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of the management of chronic cough in children. However, further studies particularly in primary health care are required.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^1e275164]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking) [,–].

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^b44ecda0]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Imaging risk considerations in pediatric chronic cough note that radiation risk from CT should be weighed carefully: “children have 10 times increased risk compared to middle aged adults” and “For a single CT examination of 200 mA, lifetime attributable cancer mortality risk is 1 in 1000 to 2500 for a 2.5-year-old child.” Accordingly, chest and sinus CTs “should rarely be performed unless other symptoms are present and ideally with prior consultation with a pediatric respiratory specialist.”

### Yardstick for managing cough, part 2: in children [^12489e47]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nationwide statistics in the United States and Australia reveal that cough of undifferentiated duration is the most common complaint for which patients of all ages seek medical care in the ambulatory setting. Management of chronic cough is one of the most common reasons for new patient visits to respiratory specialists. Because symptomatic cough is such a common problem and so much has been learned about how to diagnose and treat cough of all durations but especially chronic cough, this 2-part yardstick has been written to review in a practical way the evidence-based guidelines most of which have been developed from high-quality systematic reviews on how best to manage cough of all durations in adults, adolescents, and children. Chronic cough in children is often benign and self-limiting. Using established and validated protocols and specific pointers (clues in history, findings on examination) can aid the clinician in identifying causes when present and improve outcomes. In this manuscript, part 2 of the 2-part series, we provide evidence-based, expert opinion recommendations on the management of chronic cough in the pediatric patient (<14 years of age).

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to the management of chronic cough in a child [^3a54e3fc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Coughing is a primary pulmonary defence mechanism that enhances clearance of secretions and particles from the airways and protects against aspiration of foreign materials. Coughing may affect 30% of children at any given time (1). Many are healthy children but some may have serious underlying disease. Childhood cough accounts for a large number of consultations and 80% of families who are referred to a paediatric respiratory clinic for chronic cough have sought medical advice five times or more (2). The majority of childhood coughs are secondary to an acute respiratory tract infection and will improve once the infection resolves, usually within 1 to 3 weeks. With pre-school children who may experience between 6 and 10 respiratory infections a year differentiating acute recurrent cough from chronic cough is key (Table 1). Chronic cough can significantly impact a family's quality of life, as it affects the child's sleep, school attendance and play. Parents experience distress and anxiety, worrying that the cough may lead to long-term chest damage or even death (3). This article aims to guide clinicians through the assessment of the child with a chronic cough. It will discuss identifying causes, use of first line investigations, initiating appropriate management and addressing parental anxiety and exacerbating factors (4,5).

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^60bf23b8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cough is not standardized across the world. International experts use a variety of different guidelines, and have diverse opinions on how to define aspects of pediatric cough. Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. From an international perspective, there is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances. However, the development of such guidelines will require data gaps to be filled. In particular, clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of current acute cough therapies, and to better characterize subpopulations of pediatric patients with cough.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d9db7605]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough—etiology-based management, empiric trials, research methods, and contextual factors: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend basing the management on the etiology of the cough, and an empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that if an empirical trial is used based on features consistent with a hypothesized diagnosis, the trial should be of a defined limited duration in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized diagnosis. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that clinical studies aimed at evaluating cough etiologies use validated cough outcomes, use a-priori defined response and diagnosis, and take into account the period effect, and undertake a period of follow-up. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that exacerbating factors such as environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be determined and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated, and we suggest that parental (and when appropriate the child’s) expectations be determined, and their specific concerns sought and addressed.

### Managing human factors in the assembly of the paediatric bronchoscope [^d3bae4c9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchoscopy first saw clinical use in 1897 when Killian removed a pork bone from the right main bronchus of a German farmer. Bronchoscopes are available in a range of sizes and lengths, enabling surgeons to even safely examine the tracheobronchial tree of a premature neonate.

Foreign body aspiration is the leading cause of accidental death in children less than one year old in the United States. It is a medical emergency that requires early diagnosis and intervention. Foreign body aspiration is an important and preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. Choking followed by an acute episode of coughing is the most common presentation of foreign body aspiration. However clinical presentation may mimic different diseases, delaying the correct diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is indicated in all patients with suspected aspiration, even when the physical and radiological examination is inconclusive.

Evaluation principles in children with chronic cough: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough (Level 1B). Initial evaluation entails performing a thorough clinical assessment, a chest radiograph (CXR) and/or spirometry, followed by deciding whether any investigations and/or treatment are appropriate and/or required.

Although asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postnasal drip can be causes of cough in children, it is important to think of other potential causes, such as bronchitis, postviral cough, and foreign-body inhalation. Testing and treatment for cough will vary, depending on the presentation and diagnosis. Just as in adults, in children, the cause of cough can be multifactorial.

Conclusions

Pediatric cough is commonly encountered by primary care physicians and allergists. Physicians should be aware of the various potential causes of cough in children to properly determine the cause so that testing and treatment can proceed appropriately.

### Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d5b72335]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review relevant literature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methodology

The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, review articles, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched and reviewed by a single author. The date of the last comprehensive search was December 5, 2003, and that of the Cochrane database was November 7, 2004. The authors' own databases and expertise identified additional articles.

Results/Conclusions

Pediatric chronic cough (ie, cough in children aged <15 years) is defined as a daily cough lasting for >4 weeks. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of URTIs in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough (ie, cough associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem) and nonspecific cough (ie, dry cough in the absence of an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology). The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology. A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are a general guideline only, do not substitute for sound clinical judgment, and are not intended to be used as a protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness. Children (aged <15 years) with cough should be managed according to child-specific guidelines, which differ from those for adults as the etiologic factors and treatments for children are sometimes different from those for adults. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology, and there is no evidence for using medications for the symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, it is imperative that the children are followed up and therapy with the medications stopped if there is no effect on the cough within an expected time frame. An evaluation of the time to response is important. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences and parental expectations should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough often impacts the quality of life of both children and parents, and the exploration of parental expectations and fears is often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^b4d52ad8]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST pediatric chronic cough—recommendations for children aged ≤ 14 years emphasize guideline-based evaluation and initial testing. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms (Grade 1B), we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough (Grade 1A), we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough (Grade 1A), and we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken (Grade 1B). Although spirometry and chest radiograph (CXR) are suggested, neither are sensitive but both are specific, with a study of 326 children demonstrating an infinite positive likelihood ratio for both tests.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^b70b231f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

Does the quality of cough reported by parents of children with chronic cough provide a reliable indication of the nature of a child’s cough?
The use of terms such as ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ to characterise a cough is very subjective, and parental descriptions frequently do not reflect the clinician’s view.
Eliciting information regarding the characteristics of a child’s chronic cough is one of the key components of the history when formulating a presumptive diagnosis, but clinicians should not rely solely on the accuracy of the parent’s assessment of whether the cough is ‘dry’ or wet’.

### Use caution when giving cough and cold products to kids (...) [^7892bac0]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Safety Information for Parents and Caregivers Children under 2 years of age should not be given any kind of cough and cold product that contains a decongestant or antihistamine because serious and possibly life-threatening side effects could occur. Reported side effects of these products included convulsions, rapid heart rates and death. What about older children. When giving cough and cold medicine to children over 2 years of age, parents and caregivers should use caution. A meeting about the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold drug product use in children by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007 revealed that there were many reports of harm, and even death, in children who used these products. During 2004-2005, an estimated 1, 519 children less than 2 years of age were treated in U. S. emergency departments for adverse events, including overdoses, associated with cough and cold medications.

Manufacturers voluntarily removed over-the-counter infant cough and cold products intended for children under 2 years of age due to these safety concerns. Treating Toddlers and Older Children Cough and cold products for children older than 2 years of age were not affected by the voluntary removal and these products are still sold in pharmacies and other retail outlets. Manufactures also voluntarily re-labeled these cough and cold products to state: “ do not use in children under 4 years of age. ”. Parents need to be aware that many OTC cough and cold products contain multiple ingredients which can lead to accidental overdosing. Reading the Drug Facts label can help parents learn about what drugs are in a product. When giving children 4 years of age and older a cough and cold product, remember, OTC cough and cold products can be harmful if:
- A cool mist humidifier helps nasal passages shrink and allow easier breathing.

Do not use warm mist humidifiers. They can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult
- Saline nose drops or spray keep nasal passages moist and helps avoid stuffiness
- Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe -- with or without saline nose drops -- works very well for infants less than a year old. Older children often resist the use of a bulb syringe.
- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to reduce fever, aches and pains. Parents should carefully read and follow the product’s instructions for use on the Drug Facts label
- Drinking plenty of liquids will help children stay hydrated.

### First time wheezing in a 2-year-old [^6eaa1b48]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients with respiratory signs and symptoms who are found to be wheezing present a diagnostic dilemma to pediatricians. The majority of these cases are diagnosed as some degree of reactive airway disease, either as viral bronchiolitis or asthma. In this scenario, a patient with wheezing was initially given 2 courses of appropriate antibiotics on the basis of the duration and concurrence of other symptoms. However, he was subsequently referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for further workup after failure to improve and persistent oxygen saturations in the low-to-mid 90s. More extensive testing was completed by the pediatric pulmonologist, in addition to a short hospital admission. A rigid bronchoscopy was eventually completed, which revealed small pieces of partially digested material. Although his persistent cough resolved, his saturations continued to be suboptimal. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast was then completed, which eventually led to his diagnosis and appropriate treatment and resolution of his symptoms.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^b6cf90dd]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough—definition and general approach: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration. For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms, we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough, and we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^a2fc4623]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Our results suggest that the use of the term wet or moist by parents is highly variable. In one study Chang et al suggested that parental reporting correlated reasonably with the doctor’s assessment. However, it should be noted that the parents participating in our study were attending a respiratory clinic for the first time and participated before meeting a respiratory paediatrician, while those in the study of Chang et al had all been through the clinic for assessment of chronic symptoms prior to attending for a bronchoscopy and were probably influenced by the previous assessments. A subsequent study from the same group found reporting of frequency and quality of cough by a group of indigenous mothers whose children had been admitted to hospital to be ‘unreliable’.Our findings would suggest this is not limited to indigenous mothers as they suggested.

The key to accurate diagnosis and management of a child with a chronic cough is obtaining a good cough history, generating a hierarchy of likely diagnoses and then assessing the response to the treatment chosen. The response must be dramatic and unequivocal. Parents generally do not report that their child is coughing less or wheezing less when appropriate treatment is instituted, rather they instead commonly report their child is a ‘new child’. The response needs to be assessed at the appropriate time; for bacterial bronchitis, this is after 2 weeks of high-dose oral antibiotics, by which time the cough should have resolved in the vast majority, or after 6–8 weeks of inhaled steroids for a child with probable asthma. A diagnosis of definite asthma should never be made without a dramatic and unequivocal response to treatment, be it a dramatic change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s after a β-agonist, a complete resolution of symptoms after a short course of oral steroids or a dramatic change over 6 weeks with inhaled corticosteroids.

The results from this study suggest that although parental reports of the quality of a cough can be helpful when a clinician is attempting to determine the cause of a chronic cough, the description, as with parental reports of wheeze, may not be accurate and needs to be interpreted as part of the overall assessment. These results suggest that parental reporting of the nature of a cough can on occasions be quite subjective and that one person’s ‘dry’ cough may be another person’s ‘wet’ cough.

Pediatric respiratory distress (croup) patient care goals are to alleviate respiratory distress, to promptly identify respiratory distress, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest and intervene for patients who require escalation of therapy, and to deliver appropriate therapy by differentiating other causes of pediatric respiratory distress. Patient presentation includes inclusion criteria of suspected croup (history of stridor or history of barky cough) and exclusion criteria of presumed underlying causes including anaphylaxis, asthma, bronchiolitis (wheezing in a patient less than 2 years of age), foreign body aspiration, submersion/drowning, and epiglottitis.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^c43ccea8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, comprising a literature review together with expert opinion obtained via an online survey, has highlighted a number of issues relating to the global management of pediatric cough. In particular, while there are numerous regional guidelines for the management of pediatric cough (16 were listed in the survey), there is no established international guideline for acute or chronic pediatric cough.

There is also a lack of consensus as to what defines a pediatric patient in relation to cough. In guidelines, ‘pediatric’ refers to patients aged up to 12–18 years, and among the international experts, ‘pediatric’ could refer to patients aged up to 10–21 years. The age of patients is an important consideration in their management as it determines whether pediatric or adult guidelines are used, impacting pediatric-specific issues and risk–benefit ratios. For example, whereas respiratory function tests are standard investigations in adults, data generated from such tests may be unreliable in young children. The optimal management of cough may also vary between babies, toddlers, and older children due to differing cough etiologies with age; a point that is not fully addressed by current guidelines. Furthermore, while all guidelines separated pediatric cough into acute and chronic, there were discrepancies in the duration of cough used to define these terms. Acute cough definitions ranged from < 2–3 weeks in guidelines and from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks among experts; the equivalent definitions for chronic cough were > 4–8 weeks and > 2–8 weeks. Since acute and chronic cough are managed differently, these varying definitions mean that pediatric patients in different regions will receive differing standards of care for cough.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^5428a158]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Using management algorithms or pathways potentially improves clinical outcomes. We undertook systematic reviews to examine various aspects in the generic approach (use of cough algorithms and tests) to the management of chronic cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on key questions (KQs) using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format.

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for the systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain the final grading.

Results

Combining data from systematic reviews addressing five KQs, we found high-quality evidence that a systematic approach to the management of chronic cough improves clinical outcomes. Although there was evidence from several pathways, the highest evidence was from the use of the CHEST approach. However, there was no or little evidence to address some of the KQs posed.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes, and cough management or testing algorithms should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. A chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-β 2 agonist) should be undertaken. Other tests should not be routinely performed and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (eg, tests for tuberculosis when the child has been exposed).

### Clinical variables responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in pediatrics age group [^f71df627]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Incidence of foreign body aspiration has been noticed predominantly in age group ranging from 12months-3years. Foreign body in the trachea is a medical emergency as presentation is in respiratory distress. Obstruction of only one main or distal bronchus, leads to severe cough, choking sensation and breathlessness. Without early intervention, it can lead to collapse, consolidation and pneumonia of the affected lung.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 37 pediatric case records who presented from January 2014-December 2018 with foreign body aspiration. Our primary aim was to assess the parameters responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. We concluded with a diagnostic algorithm for management of foreign body aspiration on the basis of this outcome.

Results

Around 32.5% came with a history of aspiration, 43% were referred from the primary centers with a suspicion for the same and the rest came to our tertiary care hospital directly. Those who presented within a week came with complaints of wet cough, wheeze and tachypnea. Furthermore, those who came in after a week had a dry cough and fever as their main complaint. Majority of ingested foreign bodies was a vegetative type (80%) as compared to the non -vegetative.

Conclusion

Unlike adults, foreign body aspiration in children is most commonly diagnosed on history, suspicion and clinical findings. Chest x ray has been the primary investigation of choice but in the majority of the cases it was normal with subtle changes. Early diagnosis is the key to avoid complication.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^817f120e]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that ‘relentlessly progressive’ cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between ‘specific’ cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and ‘non-specific’ cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found [,–,].

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency [,–]. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution [,–,].

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators [,–,,]. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry [,–,,]. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Evaluation and management of airway foreign bodies in the emergency department setting [^171f1cfa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway foreign body can be a life-threatening issue in pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of these patients will first present to the emergency department.

Objective

This article provides a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of airway foreign bodies for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Foreign bodies in the upper and lower airways are potentially life threatening. This affects all age groups but is more common in pediatric patients. A history of a witnessed ingestion or aspiration event should raise the clinical suspicion for an aspirated foreign body. Patients with upper-airway foreign bodies are more likely to present in respiratory distress when compared with lower-airway foreign bodies, which often present with more subtle signs. Stridor, drooling, and wheezing suggest respiratory distress, but the presenting clinical picture is often unclear and may only include a cough. Immediate intervention is required in the patient with hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress. Airway management including laryngoscopy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and cricothyrotomy may be needed in these patients, with the emphasis on removing the obstructing foreign body and securing the airway. Specialist consultation can assist in retrieving the foreign body and managing the airway. If the patient is stable, imaging and specialist consultation for potential operating room intervention should be considered.

Conclusions

An understanding of the presentation, evaluation, and management of the patient with an airway foreign body is essential for emergency clinicians.

Cromoglycate and nedocromil reduces cough associated with asthma, and an open, single arm trial of inhaled nedocromil reported reduction in cough scores from 30 to 15 per week after 2 weeks of treatment with 4 mg qid with no additional benefit in the subsequent 4 weeks; a data summary reported the effect on asthmatic cough was significant within 24 hours and cough symptom scores improved by > 30% by day 2. For methylxanthines, one non-placebo RCT in children with acute cough found an herbal syrup was superior to an OTC medication containing theophylline and diphenhydramine, and old observational theophylline studies described chronic cough resolved within 2 weeks.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^f9d23c19]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

When participants were asked under what circumstances they perform further diagnostic investigations concerning the cause of pediatric cough (beyond patient history and physical examination), the most common response was in patients with “chronic cough” (10/16 participants; 63%), particularly if not responding to usual treatments, for repeated episodes, or in the presence of other disease symptoms. Other conditions spontaneously mentioned by one or more participants that would warrant further diagnostic investigations were allergy, aspiration/inhaled foreign body, chronic pulmonary disease, cyanosis, newborns coughing during feeding, pertussis, respiratory distress, and severe infection/pneumonia. When asked to indicate the approximate percentage of their pediatric patients with cough in which specific investigations were instigated in the past 6 months, median percentages were 31–40% for spirometry, 21–30% for chest X-ray and allergy testing, 11–20% for sputum culture, 1–10% for serology and computerized tomography scan, and 0–10% for bronchoscopy. One participant noted that fewer children with cough were referred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no pulmonary function tests were carried out due to the potential for aerosol generation.

Definitions and diagnosis of pediatric cough

Participants suggested a range of ages to define ‘pediatric’ cough, most commonly ≤18 years (9/18; 50%) or ≤ 16 years (3/18; 17%), with ≤10, ≤12, ≤15, ≤17, and ≤ 21 years suggested by 1 participant each (and 1 participant preferred not to say). Definitions provided for acute cough in children ranged from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks (or no specified duration), most commonly < 2 weeks (Fig. 1 a). Definitions for chronic cough in children ranged from > 2 weeks to > 8 weeks, most commonly > 4 weeks/> 30 days (Fig. 1 b).

Fig. 1 
Definitions of acute and chronic pediatric cough according to international experts (n = 18). a Or > 30 days. Questions were open-ended

Almost all participants (17/18; 94%) said that they distinguish between wet/productive and dry cough, for reasons including to help determine the cause and diagnosis, and to inform cough management. One participant said that they do not make this differentiation, since “it is not associated with the cause” of cough.

Regarding clinical guidelines, 11/18 participants (61%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in adults, 12 (67%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in pediatrics, 4 (22%) had no national guidelines, and 1 (6%) did not know if their country had guidelines. Ten of 17 participants (59%) said that they used a guideline for the diagnosis of pediatric cough, and 12 (71%) said that they used a guideline for the treatment of pediatric cough.

Pediatric chronic wet/productive cough (≤ 14 years) with specific cough pointers—For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and with specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), we recommend that further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy and/or chest computed tomography, assessment for aspiration and/or evaluation of immunologic competency) be undertaken to assess for an underlying disease (Grade 1B).

### A new clinical algorithm scoring for management of suspected foreign body aspiration in children [^2e158d43]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, based on Fig. 2, there were 4 patients who were eventually diagnosed with a FB but did not fulfill the predictive criteria as per our algorithm, i.e. had a score of “0”. Two of these four cases were toddlers who had chronic upper respiratory tract symptoms including persistent cough. Another presented with radiological evidence of right lower lobe bronchiectasis and the fourth with a unilateral foul smelling purulent nasal discharge with a FB extracted from the left nasal passage. In all except one of the aforementioned cases, the FB was successfully extracted via flexible bronchoscopy.

The major limitation of our study is that our data was collected and analyzed retrospectively and thus complete documentation regarding key clinical parameters such as history, CXR or physical exam findings were not available for all patients. On the other hand, the fact that this is a cohort data involving a large number of patients over a 10 year period makes this a valuable study.

### Rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal: anaesthesia and ventilation [^fba026c4]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration is a leading cause of death in children 1-3 years old, although mortality is low for children who reach the hospital. Presenting symptoms of an inhaled foreign body depends on time since aspiration. Immediately after inhalation the child starts to cough, wheeze, or have laboured breathing. If the early signs are missed, the child usually presents with fever and other signs and symptoms of chest infection. A plain chest X-ray has relatively low sensitivity and specificity for inhaled foreign body. The gold standard for diagnosis and management of this condition is rigid open tube bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia. For late presentations, time should be taken to fast the child and complete a thorough evaluation before bronchoscopy. The procedure should be performed in a well-equipped room with at least two anaesthesiologists, one with paediatric experience, in attendance. Most experienced anaesthesiologists prefer inhalational rather than intravenous induction of anaesthesia and a ventilating bronchoscope rather than intubation. Equally good results have been reported with spontaneous ventilation or positive pressure ventilation; jet ventilation is not advocated for foreign body removal in children.

### Cough quality in children: a comparison of subjective vs. bronchoscopic findings [^6b6d3c27]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Determining the validity of cough quality in children is important not only because of the commonality of the clinical problem of cough but also its use in guidelines and research studies. A particularly important finding is the presence of small amounts of secretions in children with dry cough which may have implications in the management of suppurative lung disease; a dry cough may represent early disease process where only a small amount of mucous is present.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^0638183e]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough—initial investigations and targeted testing: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken. For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyper-responsiveness be considered. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance to the clinical setting and the child’s clinical symptoms and signs. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected, and CHEST guidelines suggested clinicians consider pertussis if there is post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cough or inspiratory whoop.

### Inhalation of multiple pen caps causing bronchial foreign bodies: a rare case in an older child [^3c1b31fd]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a related case, an 11-year-old girl underwent left pneumonectomy due to a delayed diagnosis of foreign body aspiration that had gone unrecognized for years, resulting in significant lung damage. This highlights the importance of early intervention and the potential consequences of missed diagnoses. In our case, the patient did not provide a history of foreign body inhalation during the two months of treatment, complicating diagnosis and management. Reports indicate that older children may inhale foreign bodies without being aware of it, which can result in their inability to provide an accurate history of aspiration. Additionally, for patients over eight years old, there is a possibility that they may deliberately withhold information out of fear of repercussions.

Therefore, it is crucial to communicate with patience and empathy when dealing with patients presenting with pneumonia, particularly those with a history of delayed treatment. It is helpful to involve the parent, as well as the patient, in the history-taking process to help alleviate any feelings of guilt the child may feel, with support from trained staff, such as psychologists. This approach can help alleviate concerns and clarify the history of foreign body inhalation, ultimately shortening the time to diagnosis and treatment.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^fee8a94e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for >24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate >40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation <92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Otolaryngologic management of chronic cough in school-aged children: a review [^e91eb33d]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The causes of pediatric chronic cough are numerous and span across several medical subspecialties. In addition to the vast array of underlying causes, there are also several different ways to approach and evaluate chronic cough. Given the frequency with which children present to otolaryngology clinics with this problem, a review of common otolaryngologic causes and an algorithm for evaluation and treatment can be beneficial.

Observations

The primary 3 causes of pediatric chronic cough presenting to an otolaryngologist include infectious causes, reflux, and airway hyperreactivity. In these cases and other instances of specific cough, treatment should be directed at the underlying cause-which may include supportive care, antibiotics, antireflux medication, bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or other intervention. Patients with nonspecific cough should be treated according to pediatric-specific cough algorithms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Appropriate workup and treatment of chronic cough can lead to higher cure rates, shorter cough duration, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers. A systematic approach using cough algorithms can help otolaryngologists effectively manage this common yet complex problem.

### A new clinical algorithm scoring for management of suspected foreign body aspiration in children [^8efce195]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Foreign Body Aspiration (FBA) is a serious common problem in children. Any delay in its diagnosis and management can result in devastating consequences. FBA is quoted as the fifth cause of unintentional death among 1–3 year olds and the primary cause of unintentional death in babies under 12 months. Physicians often struggle with the all too important, yet elusive, decision-“To bronch, or not to bronch” patients who present with suspected FBA. In most cases, the history is often vague, with only subtle (if any), physical and chest radiological abnormalities. With this study, we aim to use our local experience in Qatar to retrospectively analyze bronchoscopically proven cases of FBA in an attempt to determine the statistically significant key clinical predictors of foreign body aspiration in children, based on the patient’s historical, physical and radiological findings at presentation.

### Foreign body aspiration: what is the outcome? [^5f59e13b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Undiagnosed and retained foreign bodies may result in serious complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or bronchiectasis. We reviewed a total of 174 children with foreign body aspiration (FBA). Clinical, radiological, and bronchoscopic findings of these patients were evaluated according to the nature of foreign body and elapsed time from aspiration to diagnosis. Significant differences were noted between patients with organic and inorganic FBA in terms of clinical and radiological findings. Cough, recurrent pneumonia, and fever were the most common presenting symptoms in patients with delayed diagnosis. Long-term follow-up was available for 110 patients for a mean duration of 37.8 +/- 23.7 months (range, 1-88 months). We evaluated the course of recovery after bronchoscopic removal. Organic FBA was of comparable duration as for inorganic FBA, and prolonged follow-up was associated with increased risk of persistent symptoms and bronchiectasis (P < 0.001). The risk of long-term complications increased with increasing elapsed time from aspiration to diagnosis; complications were as high as 60% in children who were diagnosed 30 days after FBA (P = 0.0035). Bronchiectasis was a major complication, found in 25% of patients whose diagnosis was delayed by more than 30 days (P = 0.0001). Three patients with bronchiectasis underwent lobectomy. Patients with persistent asthma-like symptoms such as cough and wheezing required treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. The positive response to this treatment was thought to be a confirmation of the development of transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by foreign bodies. We conclude that timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of FBA is important to prevent long-term complications in affected children.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9247cf2d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

### A new clinical algorithm scoring for management of suspected foreign body aspiration in children [^98af969f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Accurately diagnosing FBA in children who need quick intervention will always be challenging. A high index of suspicion is required, along with a comprehensive historical account, detailed physical exam and chest radiography. Our proposed clinical algorithm and scoring system hopes to empower physicians dealing with such cases to accurately predict patients with a high likelihood of FBA. Although, the ultimate decision for bronchoscopy may be eventually based on the physician’s clinical judgment, having a reliable, statistically proven tool to base that decision on will be invaluable in initiating prompt management in those deemed high risk for FBA, as well as avoiding unnecessary intervention in those who have a very low probability of aspiration.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^286cb35b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Eliciting a description of the nature of the cough is a key component of taking a good cough history, but it is important to recognise that by itself the nature of the cough is not diagnostic. It is simply one of a number of components in trying to reach an informed differential diagnosis. Young patients with a viral lower respiratory tract infection often have a wet cough due to the secretions in the airways which are similar in nature to the accompanying snotty nose. While asthma is classically associated with a ‘dry’ nocturnal cough, some patients with poorly controlled or untreated asthma can have a wet cough in the morning. It is a common observation to note that patients with asthma have a wet cough following a significant acute exacerbation of asthma often accompanied by harsh sounds on auscultation attributable to residual secretions after resolution of the acute bronchospasm. In contrast, most patients with a persistent bacterial bronchitis will have a daily wet cough, although some patients with relatively mild disease may appear to have a dry cough particularly in the summer. We have also seen children with an unequivocally dry irritating cough who have had thick secretion associated with chronic endobronchial infection on bronchoscopy. Several studies have now established persistent bacterial bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis when a persistent (>6 weeks) wet cough is reported,yet this diagnosis is frequently missed and misdiagnosis as asthma is common.The diagnostic challenge is compounded on occasions when bacterial bronchitis and asthma coexist, presumably secondary to the impaired mucociliary clearance and mucus plugging. Hence there are a number of reasons why the nature of a cough cannot be interpreted in isolation, one of which being uncertainty among some parents as to whether a cough is ‘wet/moist’ or ‘dry’. We often find it more helpful in getting a true picture to ask more general questions, such as ‘does he sound like a 60 a day smoker first thing in the morning?’

### Delayed diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in children [^9e436c68]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration in children is common and usually presents with an initial episode of choking with subsequent respiratory symptoms. There may be cough, wheeze, or stridor, with decreased or abnormal breath sounds on examination. However, it can mimic other illnesses and cause difficulty in diagnosis. Radiological investigations may help to confirm aspiration but should not be used to exclude it. Three cases are presented of foreign body aspiration with a delay in diagnosis ranging from days to weeks. It is believed that delay could have been avoided with a more careful approach to the history and more appropriate use of investigations. These cases demonstrate that children with a history of choking and subsequent symptoms should be referred for bronchoscopy.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^5292687d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.'

Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Clinical variables responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in pediatrics age group [^e6969e3f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Foreign-body aspiration accounts for high morbidity if the diagnosis is delayed or missed. Mortality also is reported in children, especially between ages 12 months to 3 years. Most children under the age of 3 years tend to mull over most particles in their mouths, they also have flawed nibbling habits and premature swallowing coordination which makes them more prone for a FBA. Children are more susceptible to some FBA complications due to immature defense mechanisms. Often the presentation and initial radiological findings are vague, which impedes the early diagnosis. An alleged episode of choking and severe cough is a critical evidence in the diagnosis of FB aspiration.

In our study, choking (5.40%) and hemoptysis (2.70%) were seen in limited cases. The most common symptoms in patients who presented early (< 1 week) were tachypnea (58.8%), wheeze (47.05%) and wet cough (41.1%). In cases of delayed presentation (> 1 week) majority complained of fever (65%) and dry cough (45%). It was found that the delay in presentation was mostly due to unintentional aspiration by child unnoticed by parents, vague clinical history, lack of respiratory symptoms, unwillingness by the treating physician for getting a chest X ray and delayed referral. It was noted that the duration of treatment at the local hospital was directly proportional to the duration of admission later for effective management.

Unlike adults, toddlers do not have clear recall of FBA, thus the diagnosis is most often dependent on the mother’s history, clinical findings such as onset and duration of symptoms and suspicion. Chest x -ray is the most common investigation done in these cases and majority of the time chest- x rays are normal (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 
Normal Chest x-ray in a case of early FBA

The typical findings on chest radiograph which is diagnostic is unilateral lung hyperinflation, collapse, consolidation of one lung and mediastinal shift. Many authors in their study have reported percentage of normal chest X -ray around 20–42%. In our study normal chest x-ray was found in 39% of patients. Normal chest X-ray is accepted in early phase as most aspirated foreign bodies are vegetative in nature and cannot be seen on chest x ray.

Respiratory emergencies are 1 of the most common reasons parents seek evaluation for the their children in the emergency department (ED) each year, and respiratory failure is the most common cause of cardiopulmonary arrest in pediatric patients. Whereas many respiratory illnesses are mild and self-limiting, others are life threatening and require prompt diagnosis and management. Therefore, it is imperative that emergency clinicians be able to promptly recognize and manage these illnesses.

### Basic life support. management of foreign body airway obstruction [^e7051a34]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Basic life support—management of foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) features ILCOR guidance stating that a weak recommendation is made for the initial use of back slaps in persons with FBAO and an ineffective cough, and it is suggested that abdominal thrusts be used in adults and children with an FBAO and an ineffective cough where back slaps are ineffective; evidence cited reports removal by bystanders (74% versus 32% in the control, P=0.0075). Additional ILCOR suggestions are that rescuers consider the manual extraction of visible items in the mouth and it is suggested to not use a blind finger sweep with FBAO, appropriately skilled individuals consider the use of Magill forceps to remove FBAO in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an FBAO, chest thrusts are used in unconscious persons with an FBAO, and bystanders undertake interventions to support FBAO removal as soon as possible after recognition.

### Clinical pathways for chronic cough in children [^6d0e09dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic cough (a cough lasting longer than four weeks) is a common problem internationally. Chronic cough has associated economic costs and is distressing to the child and to parents; ignoring cough may lead to delayed diagnosis and progression of serious underlying respiratory disease. Clinical guidelines have been shown to lead to efficient and effective patient care and can facilitate clinical decision making. Cough guidelines have been designed to facilitate the management of chronic cough. However, treatment recommendations vary, and specific clinical pathways for the treatment of chronic cough in children are important, as causes of and treatments for cough vary significantly from those in adults. Therefore, systematic evaluation of the use of evidence-based clinical pathways for the management of chronic cough in children would be beneficial for clinical practice and for patient care. Use of a management algorithm can improve clinical outcomes; such management guidelines can be found in the guidelines for cough provided by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of using a clinical pathway in the management of children with chronic cough.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest search was conducted in January 2014.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of parallel-group design comparing use versus non-use of a clinical pathway for treatment of chronic cough in children (< 18 years of age).

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction in duplicate.

Main Results

One study was included in the review. This multi-centre trial was based in five Australian hospitals and recruited 272 children with chronic cough. Children were randomly assigned to early (two weeks) or delayed (six weeks) referral to respiratory specialists who used a cough management pathway. When an intention-to-treat analysis was performed, clinical failure at six weeks post randomisation (defined as < 75% improvement in cough score, or total resolution for fewer than three consecutive days) was significantly less in the early pathway arm compared with the control arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.58). These results indicate that one additional child will be cured for every five children treated via the cough pathway (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5, 95% CI 3 to 9) at six weeks. Cough-specific parent-reported quality of life scores were significantly better in the early-pathway group; the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.01). Duration of cough post randomisation was significantly shorter in the intervention group (early-pathway arm) compared with the control group (delayed-pathway arm) (MD -2.70 weeks, 95% CI -4.26 to -1.14).

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that using a clinical algorithm for the management of children with chronic cough in hospital outpatient settings is more effective than providing wait-list care. Futher high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to perform ongoing evaluation of cough management pathways in general practitioner and other primary care settings.

### Foreign body inhalation: a case of mistaken identity? [^88c28fba]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Inhalation and ingestion of foreign bodies is most common in pre-school children. In recent years, children have been increasingly exposed to electronic technology containing button batteries. These may be potentially inhaled or ingested. We present the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with a choking episode and presumed inhalation of a button battery. Her chest radiograph demonstrated a potential point of confusion, with the presumed tracheal foreign body actually representing a patent ductus arteriosus coil. The true foreign body is visible in the stomach. If there is suspicion that a child has ingested or inhaled a button battery, the key stages of assessment are an accurate history and radiological investigation. This allows a prompt diagnosis so that effective intervention can be planned to avoid serious potential complications.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^e5ce012d]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤12–18 years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8 weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤10–21 years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5 days to < 6 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8 weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^72084357]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Results

All but one of the 49 parents of patients attending their first outpatient clinic who were approached agreed to participate. The most common reason for referral in every age group was chronic or persistent cough, accounting for 31 (65%) of the total referred. Cough with wheeze/troublesome asthma (8, 17%), recurrent chest infections (5, 10%), recurrent chestiness (3) and possible inhalation of foreign body (1) accounted for the others.

Many parents described the nature of their child’s cough using terms such as chesty, wheezy, tight, heavy, croupy, barking, deep or hoarse. A little over half spontaneously commented on whether it was ‘dry’ or ‘wet’, using these, or similar, terms. However, 42% required prompting before using the terms ‘wet’ or ‘dry’. Six stated that their child’s cough was mixed, and two were unsure if their child’s cough was wet or dry.

The majority of parents chose at least one video consistent with their verbal description. Partial agreement occurred when two video clips were chosen, one of which matched the parental description and one of which appeared to differ. Of the 27 (56%) parents who said that their child’s cough was dry, 18 (66%) chose a video clip which had been assessed as being a ‘dry’ cough, 1 (4%) chose a video clip with a wet cough and 8 (30%) chose more than one video clip, their choices including both dry and wet coughs. Of the 13 (27%) parents who described their child’s cough as wet, 3 (23%) chose a video clip of a wet cough, 7 (54%) chose a video clip of a dry cough and 3 (23%) chose more than one video clip, including both wet and dry coughs.

### Inhalation of multiple pen caps causing bronchial foreign bodies: a rare case in an older child [^e0479554]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Foreign body inhalation is rare in older children, often leading to underdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Most cases involve a single foreign body, but instances of multiple foreign bodies are exceedingly uncommon. This report presents a case of an elder child who inhaled two pen caps, emphasizing the need for clinical vigilance and thorough medical history collection.

Case presentation

A twelve-year-old boy was admitted with a persistent cough lasting over two months, accompanied by sputum with a peculiar odor. Previous treatments with oral Cefdinir (0.1 g, three times daily) and inhaled Budesonide Suspension had not improved his condition. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side without signs of respiratory distress or wheezing. Imaging studies, including chest X-ray and CT scan, along with bronchoscopy, confirmed the presence of two foreign bodies in the right bronchus. The patient was started on anti-infective therapy to address any underlying infection before proceeding with removal. A combination of flexible bronchoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy, supplemented by a cryotherapy instrument, successfully extracted the pen caps. Post-procedure assessments indicated that the patient’s body temperature returned to normal, cough symptoms resolved, and lung ventilation significantly improved.

Conclusion

This case highlights the critical need for clinicians to remain vigilant regarding bronchial foreign bodies in older children. The rare occurrence of multiple foreign bodies, particularly resulting from active inhalation, necessitates a comprehensive medical history during patient evaluation. Early recognition and intervention can lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of thorough clinical assessment in similar cases.

Pediatric respiratory distress (croup) patient management assessment includes history and exam elements. History includes onset of symptoms (history of choking), concurrent symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea, tongue/lip swelling, rash, labored breathing, foreign body aspiration), sick contacts, treatments given, and personal history of asthma, wheezing, or croup in past. Exam includes a full set of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) temperature, and O2 saturation; presence of stridor at rest or when agitated; description of cough; other signs of distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retracting, use of accessory muscles); color (pallor, cyanosis, normal); and mental status (alert, tired, lethargic, unresponsive).

### Hypersensitive pneumonitis: an initial presentation of chronic granulomatous disease in a child [^ba259cda]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypersensitive pneumonitis (HP) is a rare initial presentation of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), especially in children. CGD presenting as HP may result from exposure to inhaled environmental antigens and be induced by excessive production of inflammatory cytokines due to loss of reactive oxygen species production. We herein describe a 2-year-old boy with CGD caused by a mutation in CYBB gene, who initially presented with HP. The patient developed dry cough, progressive dyspnea, and fever after playing in dusty air in a factory that produced plastic materials containing isocyanates. The patient's symptoms and radiological abnormalities did not improve after antigen avoidance, but disappeared after corticosteroid therapy. Because HP is uncommon in children, we should consider the possibility of CGD in children who present with HP. A prompt diagnosis of CGD is essential to enable initiation of prophylactic antibacterial and antifungal therapies.

Coin ingestion—diagnostic steps and timing: Initial management of witnessed or suspected coin ingestions should begin with a foreign body series of radiographs to identify the presence and location of any coins; careful attention should be placed on the edges of the coin to exclude the double halo sign of a BB, and lateral films are extremely helpful in differentiating the “step-off” between the positive and negative poles of a BB that will discriminate it from a coin; esophageal coins should be removed within 24 hours on ingestion, and if the patient is acutely symptomatic, unable to manage secretions, or with respiratory or other concerning symptoms, emergent removal is indicated; otherwise, removal can be delayed up to 12 to 24 hours; a repeat radiograph should be obtained immediately before endoscopy because up to one-fourth of esophageal coins pass spontaneously within 8 to 16 hours.

### Aspiration lung disease [^d4552b5b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The term aspiration lung disease describes several clinical syndromes, with massive aspiration and chronic lung aspiration being at two extremes of the clinical spectrum. Over the years, significant advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying dysphagia, gastroesophageal function, and airway protective reflexes and new diagnostic techniques have been introduced. Despite this, characterizing the presence or absence of aspiration, and under what circumstances a child might be aspirating what, is extremely challenging. Many children are still not adequately diagnosed or treated for aspiration until permanent lung damage has occurred. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for a correct diagnosis in addition to timely and appropriate care.
