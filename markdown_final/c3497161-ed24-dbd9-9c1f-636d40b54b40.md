## Question

Does having taller family members effect how tall your kids are even if you are ahort

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether having taller family members affects how tall your kids are even if you are short. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic architecture of height and how heritability shapes offspring stature. Then, I should verify how mid-parental height and polygenic risk scores predict child height and whether they outperform single-parent height. Next, I will examine regression to the mean and within-family variance, including sibling differences. After that, I need to consider environmental modifiers and the limits of prediction. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and examples.

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation. Height is a classic polygenic trait with high heritability, typically around 60–80% in twin and family studies, and modern genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of common variants that collectively explain a substantial portion of variance, though not all of it, underscoring that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to final height [^86c91b85] [^4a7f2ce3].

> Wait, let me verify the predictive value of parental heights. Mid-parental height remains a simple, widely used clinical predictor that captures roughly 40–45% of the variance in offspring adult height, and when combined with a polygenic risk score derived from thousands of height-associated SNPs, prediction accuracy can rise to about 50–55%, indicating that parental heights carry meaningful predictive information beyond just one parent's stature [^e6efb32c] [^d70ae66a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single short parent. I should confirm the role of regression to the mean. Because extreme parental heights reflect both genetic and environmental factors that are unlikely to align identically in offspring, children of very short parents tend to be closer to average than their parents, and conversely, children of very tall parents tend to be shorter than their parents; this statistical phenomenon helps explain why a child with one short parent can still be taller than that parent, especially if the other parent or the broader family includes taller individuals [^1b720b88].

> I need to check within-family variance and sibling differences. Polygenic scores can explain about one-third of the height differences between siblings, meaning that even within the same nuclear family, genetic variation can push a child's height upward or downward relative to the family average; thus, a child with a short parent may still inherit a taller genetic profile from the other parent or from ancestral variation, yielding taller stature than the short parent [^d70ae66a].

> Let me consider environmental modifiers that can shift outcomes. Nutrition, socioeconomic status, and early-life conditions independently influence growth, and children of short parents may still achieve taller stature when environmental conditions are favorable; conversely, adverse environments can blunt genetic potential, so family height is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and improvements in nutrition and health can raise outcomes above parental expectations [^6bbe2f73] [^23c26398].

> But wait, what if the "taller family members" are not the biological parents. I should double-check that the strongest signal comes from first-degree relatives. Indeed, parental heights carry the most predictive weight, while more distant relatives contribute less; nonetheless, a family history of taller individuals signals the presence of height-promoting alleles that can be transmitted to offspring, increasing the chance that a child will exceed a single short parent's height, even if the exact magnitude remains uncertain [^d70ae66a].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and limitations. Clinicians use mid-parental height to set a target range for a child's growth, typically within about ± 10 cm of the sex-adjusted mid-parental target; deviations from that range prompt evaluation for pathological causes, but many children of short parents still fall within or above the lower bound of their familial target, reflecting normal genetic variation and regression effects rather than disease [^2eb40437] [^6f7d5a7b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, having taller family members — particularly on either parental side — can meaningfully increase the likelihood that your children will be taller than you if you are short, because offspring height reflects the combined genetic contributions of both parents and the broader ancestral background, moderated by regression to the mean and shaped by environmental factors; while prediction is probabilistic, the net effect is that many children of short parents achieve heights above the short parent's stature when the family genome includes taller variants and when environmental conditions support growth [^d70ae66a] [^e6efb32c] [^1b720b88].

---

Yes, having taller family members can increase a child's height even if the parents are short, because **height is polygenic** and influenced by many relatives beyond the parents [^86c91b85]. While mid-parental height is a strong predictor, **polygenic variation** from grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins can add taller alleles, and **environmental factors** (nutrition, health, and socioeconomic status) also modulate growth potential [^6bbe2f73]. Thus, a child may be taller than short parents if the broader family includes taller individuals and if conditions are favorable, though regression to the mean still applies [^1b720b88].

---

## Genetic inheritance of height

Height is a **polygenic trait** influenced by many genes, each with small effects [^86c91b85]. This means a child's height reflects the combined genetic contributions of both parents and the broader family, not just the parents' heights alone [^d70ae66a].

- **Mid-parental height**: A useful estimate of a child's genetic height potential, calculated as (father's height + mother's height + 13 cm for boys, or −13 cm for girls) divided by 2, with a range of about ± 10 cm [^2eb40437].

- **Polygenic variation**: Children can inherit height-promoting alleles from grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins, even if their parents are shorter, which can shift the child's height upward [^notfound].

- **Regression to the mean**: Extreme parental heights (very short or very tall) tend to move toward the population average in offspring, so children of very short parents are often taller than their parents, especially when taller relatives contribute genetic variation [^1b720b88].

---

## Influence of taller family members

Taller relatives can increase a child's height potential through **shared genetic variants** and by shaping the child's environment (e.g. nutrition, health care, and socioeconomic status) [^6bbe2f73].

- **Genetic contribution**: Taller grandparents or relatives may carry alleles that increase height, which can be passed to children even if the parents are shorter [^notfound].

- **Environmental factors**: Families with taller members often have better access to nutrition, healthcare, and education, which support optimal growth [^6bbe2f73].

- **Socioeconomic status**: Higher socioeconomic status is associated with taller stature, and families with taller members may have more resources that promote growth [^23c26398].

---

## Evidence from genetic studies

Recent studies show that **polygenic scores** derived from thousands of height-associated variants can predict adult height with accuracy comparable to mid-parental height, and combining both improves prediction [^e6efb32c]. Within-family analyses also show that **sibling height differences** are partly explained by polygenic scores, confirming that genetic variation beyond parental height influences stature [^d70ae66a].

---

## Environmental and socioeconomic factors

Environmental factors significantly modify **genetic height potential**:

- **Nutrition**: Adequate protein, calories, and micronutrients are essential for growth; deficiencies can limit height even with favorable genetics [^6bbe2f73].

- **Healthcare**: Access to pediatric care, including management of chronic diseases and endocrine disorders, supports normal growth [^9a4ade76].

- **Socioeconomic status**: Higher parental education and income correlate with taller offspring, likely via improved nutrition and healthcare [^23c26398].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinicians assess growth using **mid-parental height**, growth velocity, and bone age, and consider family height patterns when evaluating short stature. If a child is significantly shorter than the familial target range, further evaluation for underlying conditions is warranted [^6f7d5a7b].

---

## Conclusion

Even when parents are short, having taller family members can increase a child's height through **shared genetic variation** and supportive environmental factors. While mid-parental height remains a key predictor, **polygenic inheritance** and environmental modifiers mean children can exceed their parents' stature when the broader family includes taller individuals and when conditions are favorable [^d70ae66a].

### Investigation and management of tall stature [^be56abb5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Referral for an assessment of tall stature is much less common than for short stature. Although the commonest cause is an underlying familial tendency to tallness, there are important disorders that should be considered at the initial assessment. Distinguishing these conditions from normal variations of growth is the key objective when managing the child and family. In some children, further targeted investigations will be needed and in rare instances intervention to limit final height may be appropriate. This article discusses a structured approach to the assessment and management of a child with tall stature.

### How short is too short according to parents of primary care patients [^afde6673]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Height is a physical trait on a continuum. The threshold between normal and abnormal is arbitrarily set but can potentially influence medical decision-making. We sought to examine parents' perceptions of adult heights and associated demographic factors.

Methods

Parents of pediatric primary care patients of various heights completed a one-time survey. Parents answered the question "How short is too short?" for adult males and females. The results were summarized as median [interquartile range]. Factors significantly associated with height threshold by simple linear regression were included in a multivariable mixed effects analysis of covariance model.

Results

A total of 1,820 surveys were completed (83% response rate; 1,587 females, 231 males). The median threshold height deemed too short for adult females was 56 inches [48, 59] among male respondents and 57 inches [50, 60] among females (P < .05). The median threshold height for adult males was 61 inches among males [60, 64] and females [59, 66] (P < .05). The median of male minus female heights per respondent (delta heights) was 5 [2, 7] inches. Factors found to be significant main effects in a parsimonious model were sex of the adult considered, height of respondent, sex of respondent, respondent race, primary care practice, income, and having concerns about their child's height.

Conclusion

Taller acceptable height thresholds were perceived by respondents who were taller, wealthier, white, female, from nonurban practices, or who had a personal concern about their child's height. Male heights were expected to be taller than female heights. Such traits may influence who is concerned and more likely to seek medical treatment for their children.

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^d583a03a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a large proportion of parents bringing their children to pediatric endocrinology clinic make a significant error reporting their own heights, which has an influence on mid-parental target height calculation. Therefore, if there is a concern about the normality of child's growth, especially if there is a discrepancy between child's expected and actual height, measured rather than reported parental heights should be used. If only one parent is reporting the heights of both it is important to measure the absent parent at a later date if possible. Only the measured heights should be used in clinical studies, especially where a therapeutic outcome such as final height is compared to a pre-treatment calculated MPTH.

### Do parental heights influence pregnancy length? a population-based prospective study, HUNT 2 [^dbcd069d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The mechanisms that trigger onset of delivery and determine pregnancy length are poorly understood. Offspring sex, fetal growth, parity, and genetic factors may influence biological variation of pregnancy length, and various obstetric complications, including maternal and fetal disease may shorten length of pregnancy. It is not clear if maternal height is a determinant of the length of pregnancy, and studies of maternal height and pregnancy length have shown conflicting results.

Nonetheless, it has been suggested that women of short stature are at increased risk of preterm births and other pregnancy complications that may shorten pregnancy length. Short women are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life, and an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile prior to pregnancy (increased blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), and unfavorable serum lipids and glucose) have been associated with increased risk of preterm birth, low offspring birth weight and preeclampsia. Thus, factors associated with cardiovascular risk may underlie a possible association between maternal height and pregnancy length.

Among men, short stature is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but in contrast to the risk among women, it is not known whether unfavorable and common paternal cardiovascular risk factors may influence length of the fathered pregnancy. Neither is it known whether paternal height per se is associated with length of pregnancy. Still, results of large intergenerational studies suggest that paternal factors may contribute to the variation in pregnancy length.

Therefore, the main aims of this study were to assess maternal and paternal height in relation to pregnancy length, and to examine whether parental height is associated with risk for pre- or post-term birth. We have also assessed whether any association of parental height could be attributed to cardiovascular risk factors, and whether common paternal cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, BMI, serum glucose and lipids, are associated with pregnancy length.

### Explainable predictive models of short stature and exploration of related environmental growth factors: a case-control study [^2ed33023]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

This case‒control study identified predictors of short stature, emphasizing the significant influence of parental height on child height, as shown in the column‒line graphical prediction model. Childhood height growth involves both genetic and environmental factors. The height heritability ranged from 0.75 to 0.98 in an analysis of 6,752 individuals across 2,508 families. Genetic factors significantly influence a child's height, with the probability of NVSS decreasing as parental height increases. Therefore, providing early screening, regular follow-up, and timely treatment for children with shorter parents is crucial. Moreover, this study corroborates previous research indicating that environmental growth factors independently contribute to short stature onset in children. Caregiver education level was moderately yet significantly linked to the risk of short stature in children across all the column plot prediction models. In a longitudinal cohort of 10,127 children evaluated by Ghajar et al. higher caregiver education levels were associated with higher age-specific height-for-age z scores (HAZ), which aligns with findings from previous studies. The hypothesis posited that family structure characterized by higher levels of parental education, more significant family income, and higher socioeconomic status is associated with better nutritional status for children.

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^7085246e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

A recent study of parents recruited at a non-endocrinology pediatric clinic found a slightly lower mean difference of +1.09 cm for males and -0.09 cm for females. The difference between these results and ours could be because the parents were told of the nature of the study before they were asked about their height and before measurements were taken. In contrast, our parents were unaware that they were taking part in a study. Similar to our study, the authors also reported substantial individual variability.

When MPTH's were calculated, most of the inaccuracy was caused by height overestimation, which could erroneously place the child below the normal growth channel. Measuring accurate parental heights and discussing these measurements and calculated MPTH is an important component of educating families presenting with a concern about the child's growth. Taking measurements rather than relying on reported heights may help avoid unnecessary referrals and laboratory investigations of an otherwise normal short child. It has been shown that the perceived rather than actual short stature has a more substantial influence on person's psychosocial functioning; taking measurements may help reduce inaccurate perceptions.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^c5313964]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Combining the polygenic risk score and the mid-parental height could enhance predictive performance. Intuitively, the mid-parental height, while being a crude estimate of the genetic contribution, may additionally capture variance due to unmeasured environmental exposures shared by the parents and the children, particularly when families in a target population live in the same geographical area. This may partially explain the decrease of accuracy in mid-parental height prediction when a large discrepancy exists in the parental height of a child. On the contrary, our polygenic risk score more accurately quantifies the genetic contribution toward height without measuring environmental exposures. Hence, the 2 predictors provide non-overlapping information. However, how proper calibration should be carried out and whether a joint predictor is generalizable will require extensive exploration in future studies.

Our study has important limitations. First, our findings should be considered population-specific. Polygenic risk scores are usually not directly transferrable to a population of a different ethnic background. Population-specific polygenic risk scores should be developed to further explore their utility for height prediction, especially among non-European populations — once again underlining the importance of larger genetic studies of non-European ancestry that are currently scant. It should also be noted that the adult height of children in ALSPAC was, on average, 3 to 4 cm taller than that in the UK Biobank, because the former represents a much younger population. We therefore adopted the definition of short stature as 2 SDs below population mean, instead of referring to a general population-based growth curve. Moreover, despite a high heritability, adult height is also influenced by a wide range of genetic and nongenetic factors not included in the polygenic risk score, including but not limited to chronic conditions retarding growth (eg, genetic syndromes, such as Turner and Prader-Willi syndromes, treatment for childhood cancer, acquired growth hormone deficiency secondary to head trauma, etc.), rare pathogenic variants of large effects in pivotal genes, and long-term medication (eg, use of inhaled corticosteroids). Whether any interplay exists between the polygenic risk score and these risk factors may be tested with larger sample sizes and by testing the performance of this polygenic risk score in pediatric populations at risk for compromised growth.

### Do parental heights influence pregnancy length? a population-based prospective study, HUNT 2 [^fd0dfc64]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The observation that small fetuses grow slower and have longer pregnancies than average-sized fetuses, and vice versa for large fetuses, applies to low risk/non-pathological pregnancies for humans, and are also observed for some other mammals. The opposite is documented for pathological pregnancies; i.e. women with slow intrauterine fetal growth have increased risk of both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm births compared to other women. Since maternal height is a predictor of offspring birth size and fetal growth may influence pregnancy length, fetal growth could be an intermediate factor for the association of maternal height with gestational length. We did not have access to data on serial ultrasound measurements of fetal size to assess fetal growth. Offspring birth weight could serve as an indicator of fetal growth. However, birth weight was not regarded as a confounder, but as an intermediate factor or a common consequence of maternal height and gestational length. Thus, to avoid introducing a bias to the results, we chose not to adjust the analyses for birth weight. As an alternative approach, we separately assessed associations of parental heights with birth weight z-scores, and found that paternal height was positively associated with offspring birth weight. The association of paternal height with birth weight was of similar strength to that of maternal height, and contrasted the finding of no association between paternal height and pregnancy length. This different effect of parental height may suggest that gestational length and offspring birth weight are determined by different parental factors, and that the positive association of maternal height with gestational length cannot solely be explained by fetal growth.

Short women are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to tall women, and length of pregnancy tends to be shorter in women who are at increased cardiovascular risk. According to the fetal origins hypothesis, poor nutritional conditions in utero may program both slow intrauterine growth and increased risk of later cardiovascular disease. If the short stature of the woman has an intrauterine origin, their higher cardiovascular risk may also have originated in utero, and could possibly explain the observed association of short maternal height with short gestational length. However, adjustment for maternal cardiovascular risk factors did not change the effect estimates in the present study, and is therefore an unlikely explanation of the results. Possible effect modification of cardiovascular risk factors was also assessed, but we found no evidence of any interaction. Similarly, unfavorable socioeconomic conditions of the mother could be a common cause for short maternal stature and short pregnancy length, but adjustment for socioeconomic measures did not influence the results.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^307d7db1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth

As a group, children born SGA do not achieve their genetic height potential, falling on average 1 SD below mid-parental height/target height. At least 90% of children born SGA show spontaneous catch-up growth into the normal height range (> −2 SDS) during childhood. Catch-up growth is generally defined as a sustained growth rate (cm/year) > 0 SDS, that is, more than the median for chronological age and sex. Sufficient catch-up is arbitrarily defined as growing into the normal height range. This process is more pronounced during the first 6 months and usually completed within the first 2 years of life, in which 85% of children show catch-up growth to a normal length. Catch-up might take longer in infants born preterm and SGA, up to the age of 4 years. Children born SGA with a height below −2 SDS at the age of 3 years, have a 7-fold increased risk of remaining short, whereas those born SGA with a birth weight below −2 SDS have a 5-fold increased risk. The reasons for insufficient catch-up growth in children born SGA are poorly understood. Factors that positively influence childhood growth include female sex, multiple birth, taller parents, and more rapid gain in length during early life.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^4a7f2ce3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Predicting Height

An important concern for many families is predicting the adult height of their children. Given the influence of genetics on height, it would appear that genetic profiling of patients would offer an ideal approach for predicting adult height. Here, we review what GWASs have informed us about how effective genetics may be for the prediction of height.

The heritability of height, or the proportion of variation in height in the population that can be attributed to genetic variation, is estimated to be 60% to 80%, making it one of the more heritable traits. However, using the results of the GWAS of 250,000 samples and ∼700 regions of the genome independently associated with height, we are able to explain only 17% of the total variation in height. Sophisticated genetic studies have demonstrated that common genetic variants explain much of the heritability of height, and variants that are too rare to be detected by GWAS are likely to contribute less to the proportion of variance in height explained by genetics, at least in the population of individuals with heights close to the normal range. GWASs with larger sample sizes and improved power will likely detect some of these additional height-associated variants and increase the proportion of variation in height that can be explained.

Chan et al. sought to empirically evaluate how well GWAS variants could explain height. The study used the 180 height-associated GWAS variants from Lango Allen et al. and examined the height predictions in very tall and very short individuals (the top and bottom 1.5th percentile of individuals) from an independent cohort. The study found that the height estimated by using genetic markers was directionally concordant with the actual height. That is, individuals who are tall had on average higher genetically predicted height. Interestingly, the genetic predictions did not perform as well for very short individuals. The authors suggested that on the short extremes of height, individuals may have short stature because of rare variants of larger effect (perhaps as Mendelian genetic causes of short stature) that are not captured well by the GWAS, or perhaps from other nongenetic causes.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^e93a5ae2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Predicting adult height is important to monitoring childhood growth and development, particularly for children in some jurisdictions who may be considered for growth hormone therapy for "idiopathic short stature". Various approaches have been developed and clinically adopted for adult height prediction, based on current height measures and bone age as measured by hand and wrist X-ray, such as the Bayley-Pinneau method, the Tanner-Whitehouse methods, and the Roche-Wainer-Thissen method. While bone age has been recognized as one of the most important predictors of final adult height and has been employed in these prediction approaches, measuring bone age requires an X-ray and a radiologist's interpretation of the images and calculation of the predicted adult height. Also, in some medical conditions affecting bone structure (such as glycogen storage diseases), determination of bone age from X-ray can be challenging.

Since height is highly heritable, with an estimated heritability of approximately 80%, efforts have been made to genetically predict height. In the 19th century, the concept of mid-parental height was proposed. It has been either used directly as an empirical predictor of adult height or incorporated into other height prediction methods, such as the bone age-free Khamis-Roche method, to represent the genetic contribution to an individual's adult height. Nevertheless, mid-parental height has a few noteworthy limitations. First, it is a surrogate of genetic effects and does not reflect the exact number of height-influencing alleles inherited from the parents. Consequently, its accuracy as a predictor decreases when the precision of the measurement of parental heights decreases. This can occur when the parents' height is estimated or measured after it has started declining from peak adult height. Further, when one or both biological parents' heights are unknown (which often happens for adopted children and nonnuclear families or when a parent is deceased) calculating mid-parental height may be impossible. Hence, finding alternative and more accurate genetic predictors of adult height could be helpful to clinicians.

### Within-sibship genome-wide association analyses decrease bias in estimates of direct genetic effects [^086abfe7]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^94d3a859]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Directly assessing the presence of alleles that influence height has become practical and relatively low cost through the use of genomewide genotyping. With large genotyped cohorts, such as the UK Biobank, polygenic risk scores for complex traits of high heritability and polygenicity have been developed and achieved high predictive and discriminative power. Although it has been shown that at least 3290 near-independent genomewide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with adult height, a recently constructed polygenic risk score has been able to explain about 40% of the total variance in sex-adjusted height z-scores.

In this study, we sought to develop and optimize a polygenic risk score for adult height using state-of-the-art methods based on 607 346 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) study. We then evaluated how well such a polygenic risk score performed compared to mid-parental height in its ability to predict adult height of 941 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Last, we tested the ability of the polygenic risk score to identify children who would later have an adulthood short stature.

### Secular changes and predictors of adult height for 86 105 male and female members of the Thai cohort study born between 1940 and 1990 [^23c26398]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2012). Low credibility.

Attained adult height reflects, among other things, childhood health and nutrition, and thus the greater average heights that we have observed in the younger compared to the older participants suggests a marked improvement in childhood conditions in Thailand over the second half of the 20th century. This is in keeping with the large increase in gross domestic product per capita that has occurred over this period (gross domestic product per capita increased from US$990 in 1950 to US$4267 in 1990; international purchasing power parity dollars — constant year 2000 prices). However, the benefit seems to have been unequally distributed as the rate of increase in height appears to have been substantially greater for urban compared with rural dwellers. Rural–urban differences in height have been reported in Europeanand Asianpopulations but, at least in the European studies, height differences by locale appear to be decreasing rather than increasing. However, in Thailand increasing income inequality between rural and urban populations has been apparent from the 1960s through to at least the early 1990s, spanning the years in which the majority of our cohort members were children. The increasing height differences we have observed between rural and urban dwellers therefore probably reflects widening economic disparities between urban and rural communities and concomitant effects on childhood health and nutrition.

Our other findings in relation to childhood circumstances reflect what has been observed in a variety of countries (both developed and developing), including the positive relation between height and birth size, parental levels of education, and number of assets in the family home; and the inverse relation between height and family size. The suggestion that later born children are on average taller than those first born has also been reported elsewhere, although others have found the inverse to be true. It may be that issues such as birth spacing and cultural influences on care patterns in families account for these differences, but we did not have the relevant data to explore this issue further. Overall, our findings in relation to childhood circumstances most likely reflect the effect on growth of access to resources in early childhood and ultimately the adequacy of nutrition (both quality and quantity) and the ability to control childhood infection.

### Final height prediction in constitutional growth delay [^1969dc77]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Methods to predict the final stature of children are commonly used in pediatric endocrinology since one of the questions that parents have about their short children is how tall he or she will be as an adult. There is a disparity between what the family wants and what the physician expects from a height prediction, and what is available. The family wants an accurate prediction of final height for their child. What the physician expects is a well-validated and accurate technique applicable to individual children and that can be trusted for use, not just with normally growing children, but also with children exhibiting abnormal growth. Unfortunately, what is available from the generally used height prediction methods are estimates, with fairly broad error limits, based on groups of normal children followed to adult height. The underlying problem in predicting final height is that there is considerable individual variation in the timing and tempo of puberty and the pubertal growth spurt in individual children which significantly impacts the validity of the techniques when applied to individual children. This article reviews the methods of height prediction that are available, and their limitations.

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^bc7ed07b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Determination of the mid-parental target height (MPTH) is a critical first step in the assessment of a child with short stature, and obtaining accurate parental heights is essential when determining the MPTH. Parental height often determines the extent of a work up and/or therapeutic intervention, and serves as an outcomes benchmark for clinical trials. Our experience has been that primary care physicians usually ask for but infrequently measure parental heights. We have casually observed that often there is a significant discrepancy between reported and measured parental heights. To date several epidemiological studies have been conducted investigating the accuracy of self-reported anthropometric measurements in different population groups. These studies revealed that there is a substantial error in individual reports with overall trends to overestimate own height and underestimate own weight. Height overestimation was more prominent among the short adults. Many of the short children referred to a pediatric endocrine clinic come from the short families and if their parents in fact do overestimate their heights, there may be a mismatch between children's actual and expected heights leading to unnecessary worry and investigations.

Both the populations studied and the setting of the previous epidemiological studies does not closely resemble those encountered in pediatric clinical practice, where parents are questioned without them expecting to be measured. On the other hand they have a particular interest in their child's height which might either improve or worsen their own accuracy. Many studies on the outcome of therapeutic interventions to increase final height have compared final height to mid-parental target heights, which are usually obtained in these studies from parental report.

We designed this study to assess whether there is a significant difference between the reported and measured parental heights from our referral population. We also investigated whether the accuracy of height self reports depended on person's gender, height, ethnic background or the reason for which the child had been brought for the evaluation, and whether any error in height reporting, if such existed, affected the accuracy of MPTH.

### Childhood stunting and mortality between 36 and 64 years: the British 1946 birth cohort study [^91ff00e1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In keeping with several previous studies, we found that taller adult height was robustly related to lower risk of all-cause mortality, and this association was not confounded by SEP or smoking. Uniquely, compared with previous studies, we were able to show that the association with adult mortality was strongest with height in early childhood. A recent study similarly reported that the inverse association between height and risk of adult coronary heart disease was strongest at age 7 years; however, they only had data on heights between ages 7 and 13 years. Notably, the associations between height and mortality in our study were nonlinear and appeared to be largely explained by short height at age 6 years (corresponding to height less than the ninth percentile on current growth charts). Others have also reported nonlinear associations; for example, in a large Norwegian cohort only adult height up to 165 cm was related to higher all-cause mortality, but they did not have information on childhood heights.

The birth cohort study design allowed us to identify early life factors that were related to both childhood short height and adult mortality. Midparental height is commonly interpreted as a marker of the child's genetic height potential. Most of the variation in growth after age 2 years is estimated to be genetically determined. Alternatively, it is possible that the associations with parental heights reflected some influence of the parents' own childhood environment; however, the association with mortality was independent of SEP. Lack of breastfeeding in the 1940s would have increased the risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, as is seen in contemporary birth cohorts in lower income settings. Furthermore, the quality and availability of infant formula milk would have been poor, being largely based on evaporated milk. In contrast, in contemporary Western birth cohorts, formula milk–fed infants show faster growth rates, presumably due to increased nutritional intakes in settings of low infection risk. Having many young children in the household was the third factor associated with both childhood short height and adult mortality. Whereas this again could reflect the higher risks of early life infection and poor nutrition, the markers of environmental adversity clustered together, and it may be inappropriate to single out any specific factor in a birth cohort whose members were relatively deprived and short as children by today's standards.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^69be0254]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Future Perspectives

Over the past decade, GWASs for height have been highly successful in identifying regions in the genome relevant for growth. They have generated remarkable biological insights, such as implicating the previously underappreciated STC2/PAPPA/IGFBP4 pathway. We have also learned about the genetic architecture of height and found that it is incredibly complex: Many thousands of genetic variants each influence height by just a small amount, but when combined, they generate the remarkable normal variation we observe in height, providing a clear model for how polygenic factors combine to regulate a human phenotype. Intriguing genetic overlaps between height and seemingly unrelated traits, such as CAD and educational attainment, have also been found.

There are many continued efforts to perform GWASs for height, in both European populations and other ethnic groups. The sample sizes in these efforts are ever-increasing in size and will likely identify many additional regions of the genome that influence height. Additional efforts will also focus on rarer variants, which as demonstrated by Marouli et al. can help directly implicate causal genes because the associated variants are in the coding regions of the genes themselves. With these additional GWAS discoveries, we will likely be able to explain increasing proportions of the observed variation in height.

Improved predictive power of GWAS variants could in the near future make the application of GWAS data a useful clinical tool, as has been recently demonstrated with other diseases or traits, such as CAD. With improved predictive power, adding a child's genetic information to parental heights and clinical information may improve the accuracy of predictions of adult height and could perhaps provide opportunities to identify those who may benefit from therapeutic intervention. Genomically predicted height could also assist in the evaluation of children presenting to the clinic with disorders of growth. For example, if a child with short stature has a genomically predicted height that is average or tall, this might suggest an underlying chronic disease that is impairing growth, or a rare genetic cause of short stature. In such a case, the patient would be a better candidate for more intensive clinical evaluation that could eventually include whole exome or genome sequencing. By contrast, if the genomically predicted height is short and thus consistent with the child's short stature, additional evaluation might be of lower yield because the short stature can be explained by the child's complement of naturally occurring common genetic variants. Testing whether incorporation of GWAS findings in the clinic is a useful tool represents an important area of future investigation.

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^d96780a3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis

Among the fathers there was a trend of more substantial height overestimation in the group of average men than the group of taller or shorter men. The average men had a mean overestimate of being 2.0 cm taller than their measured heights, (range 4.5 cm shorter than measured to 8.4 cm taller) while the tall men had a mean overestimate of being 0.6 cm taller than measured, (range 1.3 cm shorter to 4.2 cm taller) and the short men had a mean overestimate of being 1.3 cm taller than measured (range 3.6 cm shorter to 7.3 cm taller)(figure 3).

Figure 3
Subgroup analysis – fathers. Percentage of parents in each group who reported their heights accurately, moderately inaccurately and very inaccurately. Total: all groups, Tall: parents with height SDS of > 1, Average: SDS -1 to 1, Short: SDS of < 0, SS: parents of a child with chief complaint of short stature, Other: parents of a child with non-short stature complaint, White: white parents, Hispanic: Hispanic parents.

Among the mothers, there was no significant correlation between the height and mean reported height, but short women made more frequent erroneous own height assessments and to a larger degree. The short mothers' mean overestimate was 0.4 cm taller than measured (range 22.1 cm shorter to 11.8 cm taller), average mothers' mean overestimate was 0.3 cm taller (range 4.5 cm shorter to 8.2 cm taller) and tall mothers' overestimate was 0.6 cm taller (range 2.6 cm shorter to 3.6 cm taller) (figure 4).

Parents who brought their children for short stature evaluation were more accurate in their height self-report compared to the parents who brought their children for other endocrine concerns.

### The treatment of parental height as a biological factor in studies of birth weight and childhood growth [^9f0f5bec]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Parental height is frequently treated as a biological variable in studies of birth weight and childhood growth. Elimination of social variables from multivariate models including parental height as a biological variable leads researchers to conclude that social factors have no independent effect on the outcome. This paper challenges the treatment of parental height as a biological variable, drawing on extensive evidence for the determination of adult height through a complex interaction of genetic and social factors. The paper firstly seeks to establish the importance of social factors in the determination of height. The methodological problems associated with treatment of parental height as a purely biological variable are then discussed, illustrated by data from published studies and by analysis of data from the 1958 National Childhood Development Study (NCDS). The paper concludes that a framework for studying pathways to pregnancy and childhood outcomes needs to take account of the complexity of the relation between genetic and social factors and be able to account for the effects of multiple risk factors acting cumulatively across time and across generations. Illustrations of these approaches are given using NCDS data.

### Adult height variants affect birth length and growth rate in children [^d8a5289e]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Twin and family studies have shown adult human height to be highly heritable (80–90%). Twin studies also suggest that the genetic contribution to height varies throughout childhood with birth length and early growth appearing to have stronger environmental influences than later growth and height which appears to be more strongly influenced by genetic variation.

Many genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified loci associated with adult height. A recent meta-analysis which included 133 653 European subjects in the genome-wide scan and 50 074 subjects in follow-up identified 180 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adult height, explaining ∼10% of the variation. However, none of these studies has related these SNPs to height growth in childhood.

The balance of genetic and environmental influences on growth is likely to differ across childhood. Birth size may be influenced more by maternal size and the intrauterine effects of maternal behaviours such as smoking than genetics, although birth length has been shown (through correlations with paternal size) to be more genetically influenced than other aspects of fetal growth, such as weight. Infancy is then considered to be a canalization period, whereby growth shifts an infant's size from their birth size to their genetically determined size and growth pattern. Thus, in the first 2 years of life, many infants exhibit height centile-crossing, i.e. a child whose height at one time point sits on a low centile of the population distribution of height may well have a height on a higher centile of the population distribution at a later time point, and vice versa. Later in childhood, height tends to follow a stable pattern in terms of the centile of the population distribution, which is assumed to be the genetically determined growth pattern. Thus, it is possible that genetic variation has relatively less influence on birth length and growth in infancy, and more influence on growth later in childhood. This, however, has not yet been empirically tested using data from longitudinal cohort studies and SNPs identified from GWAS.

### Genetic testing of children with familial tall stature: is it worth doing? [^19a34a9f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Familial tall stature (FTS) is considered to be a benign variant of growth with a presumed polygenic etiology. However, monogenic disorders with possible associated pathological features could also be hidden under the FTS phenotype.

Objective

To elucidate the genetic etiology in families with FTS and to describe their phenotype in detail.

Methods

Children with FTS (the life-maximum height in both the child and his/her taller parent > 2 SD for age and sex) referred to the Endocrinology center of Motol University Hospital were enrolled into the study. Their DNA was examined cytogenetically and via a next-generation sequencing panel of 786 genes associated with growth. The genetic results were evaluated by the American College of Molecular Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All of the participants underwent standard endocrinological examination followed by specialized anthropometric evaluation.

Results

In total, 34 children (19 girls) with FTS were enrolled in the study. Their median height and their taller parent's height were 3.1 SD and 2.5 SD, respectively. The genetic cause of FTS was elucidated in 11/34 (32.4%) children (47, XXX and 47, XYY karyotypes, SHOX duplication, and causative variants in NSD1 [in 2], SUZ12 [in 2], FGFR3, CHD8, GPC3, and PPP2R5D genes). Ten children had absent syndromic signs and 24 had dysmorphic features.

Conclusion

Monogenic (and cytogenetic) etiology of FTS can be found among children with FTS. Genetic examination should be considered in all children with FTS regardless of the presence of dysmorphic features.

### Investigation and management of short stature [^7acfacf5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Paediatricians need to develop a strategy for assessing and managing the short child because it is a common reason for referral to paediatric services. Understanding what is normal is a key prerequisite to the appropriate assessment of the short child. Most pathological causes of short stature will be associated with clues in the history or on examination. Factors that should trigger a more detailed assessment of the short child include malaise, dysmorphic features, slow growth and small size with a normal weight centile. Establishing that the healthy short child is growing appropriately for their family size can be reassuring for the family and clinician and will facilitate discharge.

### A genetic approach to evaluation of short stature of undetermined cause [^3674f07a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Short stature is a common presentation to paediatric endocrinologists. After exclusion of major endocrine or systemic disease, most children with short stature are diagnosed based on a description of their growth pattern and the height of their parents (eg, familial short stature). Height is a polygenic trait and genome-wide association studies have identified many of the associated genetic loci. Here we review the application of genetic studies, including copy number variant analysis, targeted gene panels, and whole-exome sequencing in children with idiopathic short stature. We estimate 25–40% of children diagnosed with idiopathic short stature could receive a molecular diagnosis using these technologies. A molecular diagnosis for short stature is important for affected individuals and their families and might inform treatment decisions surrounding use of growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor 1 therapy.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^8316f200]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The polygenic risk score might provide clinical utility. For example, parental height may not be available due to various reasons (eg, many children do not know both parents' height), and in many more cases it is inaccurately measured or reported, and thus a potentially erroneous estimate might be supplied. Also, large discrepancies in parental heights render mid-parental height a less valid adult height predictor, particularly when some parents do not achieve their genetically determined height because of disease that is not inherited by the child. Under these circumstances, a polygenic risk score may be utilized instead, not only as a single predictor but also in other accurate multivariate predictive models, such as the Khamis-Roche method. Even though the self-reported height and weight measures during puberty in the ALSPAC cohort may contain measurement errors, the superior performance of Khamis-Roche predictors over the mid-parental height or the polygenic risk score alone should encourage further investigations into incorporating an accurate genetic predictor into established scoring schemes. We further demonstrated that even if only 1 parent could provide measured height, a combined predictor with the polygenic risk score could have importantly improved predictive and discriminative power over using the single parental height. We posit that these advantages could be considered when undertaking genetic prediction of adult height both in both clinical and research settings. Since genomewide genotyping has become more affordable (currently priced at approximately US$40 in a research context), is undertaken once in a lifetime, and could be used to predict several health outcomes, genetic prediction of adult height in children and adolescents could be widely and cost-effectively applied in research and clinical practice.

### Maternal height and child growth patterns [^a04578b8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine associations between maternal height and child growth during 4 developmental periods: intrauterine, birth to age 2 years, age 2 years to mid-childhood (MC), and MC to adulthood.

Study Design

Pooled analysis of maternal height and offspring growth using 7630 mother-child pairs from 5 birth cohorts (Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa). We used conditional height measures that control for collinearity in height across periods. We estimated associations between maternal height and offspring growth using multivariate regression models adjusted for household income, child sex, birth order, and study site.

Results

Maternal height was associated with birth weight and with both height and conditional height at each age examined. The strongest associations with conditional heights were for adulthood and 2 years of age. A 1-cm increase in maternal height predicted a 0.024 (95% CI: 0.021–0.028) SD increase in offspring birth weight, a 0.037 (95% CI: 0.033–0.040) SD increase in conditional height at 2 years, a 0.025 (95% CI: 0.021–0.029 SD increase in conditional height in MC, and a 0.044 (95% CI: 0.040–0.048) SD increase in conditional height in adulthood. Short mothers (< 150.1 cm) were more likely to have a child who was stunted at 2 years (prevalence ratio = 3.20 (95% CI: 2.80–3.60) and as an adult (prevalence ratio = 4.74, (95% CI: 4.13–5.44). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by site or sex.

Conclusion

Maternal height influences offspring linear growth over the growing period. These influences likely include genetic and non-genetic factors, including nutrition-related intergenerational influences on growth that prevent the attainment of genetic height potential in low- and middle-income countries.

### Growing up with idiopathic short stature: psychosocial development and hormone treatment; a critical review [^e98ffeac]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

To facilitate decisions on interventions in medically referred children with idiopathic short stature, the research on psychosocial functioning of these children, possible risk and protective factors influencing adaptation, and effects of hormone treatment were reviewed. Parents ranked the behaviour of their children on average between normal and below normal. The magnitude of these deviations varied from small to large. Little is known about the children's self-perceived psychosocial functioning. Some risk factors were found: being teased, being juvenilised, being a boy, having a younger but taller sibling, low intelligence, and low socioeconomic status. There have been few studies on the impact of protective factors including temperament, coping strategies, and social support. On average, hormone treatment did not improve psychosocial functioning. The research shows the advantages and disadvantages of hormone treatment that must be considered when choosing a suitable intervention. It is suggested that psychosocial adjustment can be improved by focusing on factors other than height alone.

### Predictive accuracy of combined genetic and environmental risk scores [^583e12e5]. Genetic Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 5 is a directed acyclic graph showing a simplified situation in which the family history is entirely explained by genetics. Although in many cases shared environment also contributes to family history, this graph may be fairly appropriate for height because it is highly heritable and parents have often reached their full stature before producing offspring. Under this structure, the parameters of the quantitative model may be derived exactly in terms of the heritability.

Figure 5
Directed acyclic graph showing correlation between polygenic and environmental scores arising from family history

A simplified scenario is shown in which there are no shared environmental effects. G: polygenic score; F: polygenic scores of other family members; X: family history; Y: outcome.

Assume the commonly used value of 80% for the heritability of height. Under an additive model, the height of a child is the sum of genetic contributions from mother and father and of unique environmental contributions. It is easy to show that the genetic covariance between the child and the mean‐parents is half the heritability, and then that the genetic correlation. Furthermore the variance in child explained by the mean‐parents is twice the square of the covariance, so, which is taken as the predictive accuracy of the family history. Finally, the chip heritability of the mean‐parents is half the chip heritability.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^0f7082da]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

To illustrate the limitations of current GWAS results for predicting height, we show the CIs of height predictions using genetics (modeled for a European-ancestry population, where to date the largest studies have been performed) (Fig. 4). Using only a child's sex, we can predict height with a 95% CI of approximately ± 13.9 cm. Leveraging all of the current GWAS results, which collectively explain 17% of variation in height, we can narrow the 95% CI of our prediction to ± 12.7 cm. Thus, even with extensive information about a child's genetics, current technologies do not provide much additional benefit in predictions of adult height on a population level, especially if the parental heights are known. In an ideal world where the genetic associations can explain fully the 80% of variation in height, we would be able to narrow this 95% CI to ± 6.2 cm. However, future GWAS results may confer increasing predictive power, especially for individuals at the extremes of GWAS-predicted heights. Additionally, individuals whose GWAS-predicted height is discordant from their actual height might be more likely to have an undiagnosed underlying growth disorder or chronic disease.

Figure 4.
Efficacy of genetic data for the prediction of height. Displayed are the width of the 95% CI for height predictions if no genetics are taken into account, all current GWAS-associated variants (combining to explain 17% of variation) are used, or in an ideal setting where all of variants that influence height are known (combining to explain 80% of variation) and used to predict height. Calculations are based on an average height of 177 cm with an SD of 7.1 cm for men of European ancestry. The black bars are for an individual with an average predicted height (177 cm). The blue bars are for an individual whose predicted height is 2 SDs above the mean (191.2 cm). The red bars are for an individual whose predicted height is 1 SD below the mean (169.9 cm).

### Parental concerns on short stature: a 15-year follow-up [^8c6f2d16]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare parental attitudes about short stature over time and determine possible factors that predict changes in attitudes.

Study Design

At baseline (1993–1994), we surveyed parents about their attitudes regarding their children's height. We compared parents of children (aged 4–15 years) referred to endocrinologists (referred, 154) with those of children with heights < 10th percentile seen by pediatricians during regular visits (control, 240). At follow-up (2008–2009), 103 control and 98 referred parents completed a similar survey. We then made a logistic regression analysis to observe changes in perception. Primary variables included self-esteem, treatment by peers, and ability to cope with current height.

Results

At baseline, referred parents perceived a worse impact of short stature on their children than did controls. At follow-up, instead, referred parents were 3.8 times more likely to report improvement in self-esteem, 2.4 times more likely to report improved treatment from peers, and 5.7 times more likely to report overall ability to cope with height than were unreferred parents. Perception of psychosocial improvement was greater in the referred than the control group. Referral was a stronger predictor of an improved follow-up response than patients' current height or change in height.

Conclusions

While incorporating parental attitudes into management decisions, clinicians should be aware that parental perceptions may change over time and that referral itself may lead parents to perceive psychosocial improvements over time.

### Tall girls… [^220cf48a]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Children at risk for tall stature due to acromegaly thus became the first recipients of estrogen and testosterone therapy for prevention of excess growth during the 1940s. 6 Clinical trials revealed that estrogen preparations, in contrast to testosterone preparations, were particularly successful for preventing tall stature in children with acromegaly. As a consequence, physicians naturally considered whether the same treatment could be applied in other settings. Girls with constitutional tall stature represented a potential group of patients for whom hormone therapy might prevent further growth, an outcome that some considered desirable.

The scientific literature details that parents were concerned about the social implications of their daughters being too tall, including difficulty and expense in finding clothes that fit, lack of interest in schoolwork and play, and future difficulty in finding employment in some careers, such as air hostess, classical ballet dancer, or military or airline pilot. 17 There was also discussion of the negative psychosocial effects of excessively tall stature, which included depression, social withdrawal, and even "kyphosis an effort to appear smaller and more like the others. "18. This was a relational view of height in which women's height was seen in relation to men's height. These sorts of norms were reflected in the medical rationale for estrogen treatment of girls but not boys. Tall girls were said to be dissatisfied with the "prospect of towering over the average male. "24 They were "less attractive than their shorter, more graceful sisters.

"25 Thus, physicians were charged with preventing excess growth to increase a girl's physical desirability and her chances of a successful marriage. This skepticism may have led to a diminishing interest in the estrogen treatment of tall girls, which was reflected in physician surveys. Whereas mostly girls were evaluated for tall stature and were treated with estrogen in the past, twice as many boys than girls are evaluated for short stature and are treated with GH today. 65, 66 In his book Better Than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream, philosopher Carl Elliott argues that one of the sociologic reasons.

Although the increasing social value of height for girls as well as the increasing concern about the adverse effects of estrogen therapy likely influenced the decline in the use of estrogen therapy, the use of GH therapy for short males has replaced estrogen therapy as a means for preventing what was and might still be considered the union most offensive to taste: the union of a tall woman with a short man. 23 In essence, GH treatment of short stature in boys could be considered the 21st-century counterpart to estrogen treatment of tall stature in girls.

### Secular changes and predictors of adult height for 86 105 male and female members of the Thai cohort study born between 1940 and 1990 [^8184ae51]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Mean heights and 95% CI among (a) Thai men and (b) Thai women who resided in rural or urban locations at age 10–12 years.

Table 4 shows the estimates of effect on height change of various measures of childhood circumstances. Participants' birth year remained a significant predictor of height after adjustment for the measured childhood factors, with approximately half a centimetre increase in height per decade for both women and men.

Table 4
Adjusted * estimates of height change (cm) for a unit change in factors associated with childhood circumstances among Thais

Several other childhood factors were significantly associated with attained adult height. Educational attainment of both parents was related to height of both men and women. Maternal education level was more important for women, such that those with mothers with tertiary education were on average 1.1 cm (95% CI 0.7 to 1.5 cm) taller than those whose mothers had no formal education; for men, paternal level of education was associated with the larger effect, such that men whose fathers had tertiary education were on average 1.4 cm (95% CI 1.0 to 1.8 cm) taller than men whose fathers had no formal education. Of the factors considered, birth size (recalled by relatives) was associated with the largest effects on height for both sexes. Women who were considered large or overweight at birth were on average approximately 2.8 cm taller than those considered small or underweight at birth, and the corresponding estimate for men was 3.3 cm. Those who reported having been breast fed were on average approximately 0.3 cm taller than those who reported they were not breast fed, although this effect disappeared when birth size was added to the model (0.05 cm; 95% CI −0.18 to 0.27 for women and −0.01 cm; 95% CI −0.33 to 0.31 for men). Having larger numbers of siblings was associated with shorter stature, with a more pronounced effect in men than women. Birth order was also important with both later born men and women tending to be taller than those first born.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^df2dab33]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — factors influencing response to growth hormone (GH) — Factors predictive of taller adult height include taller baseline height prior to GH initiation, tall parental heights (ie, mid-parental height), younger age at initiation of therapy, longer duration of treatment (especially pre-pubertal treatment duration), and higher GH dose. Mathematical prediction models have been developed with the goal of providing accurate information for long-term outcomes (height gained and height attained), but the complexity of these models has impeded their use in clinical practice. Additional intrinsic genetic variation are also associated with GH responsiveness in TS but such detailed genetic analyses are not currently available for routine clinical use, and characteristics such as the patient's baseline height and mid-parental height, while not modifiable, may provide useful information to facilitate realistic expectations of treatment outcomes.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^3712eba0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Accurate prediction of adult height is important for the management of short stature in childhood. As well as selecting which children may require growth hormone therapy for idiopathic short stature, it may also help to inform which children should be further investigated for chronic health conditions affecting growth, such as growth hormone deficiency or genetic syndromes. Given the exceptionally high heritability of height, there have been long-standing interest and efforts to genetically predict adult height. Yet, the most commonly used genetic predictor has been the mid-parental height, which simply averages the height of a child's biological parents and adjusts for the sex of the child. In this study, we constructed efficient polygenic risk scores for adult height, leveraging > 600 000 individuals of European ancestry. Using an external cohort of 941 samples, we demonstrated that, for the first time, a polygenic risk score was able to perform as well as the mid-parental height in predicting children's adult height and in identifying children who would have adult short stature. Further, combining mid-parental height and the polygenic risk score provided better prediction accuracy than either metric alone.

### Dynamic alterations in linear growth and endocrine parameters in children with obesity and height reference values [^4a47b2ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3.2 Growth acceleration in children with obesity is independent from parental height and birth length

As familial predisposition is a major determinant for height, we corrected for mid-parental height (Height parental adj SDS) and found a similar pattern indicating that children with obesity were taller independent of familial predisposition (Fig. 1 c + d). However, when corrected for parental height, individuals with obesity had an increased final height compared to normal-weight peers. We did notice, however, that the parents of children with obesity in our study were slightly shorter than parents of normal-weight children (Additional file 1, IVa).

Next, we investigated the influence of birth weight and length on later heights, as we observed that, independent from weight status, height SDS of 4–14 years old children were lower in previously small (SGA) than in appropriate (AGA) and particularly large for gestational age (LGA) born children (Additional file 1, IVb, Figure S5).

Particularly girls with obesity had already been heavier at birth by > 110 g and also birth length was higher compared to their normal-weight peers (Additional file 1, IVb, Table S6).

We investigated more in detail if mid-parental height or birth length were associated with this prepubertal increase in height SDS observed in children with obesity (Fig. 1 a + b). To address this question, we modeled the differences in height SDS across age between normal-weight and children with obesity (Additional file 1, IVc, Figure S6) and defined three age intervals according to the slopes. In the first age interval, in boys as well as in girls, regression analyses showed significant differences in age trends between the weight groups with a steeper slope of height SDS in the obesity group compared to the normal-weight group (Additional file 1, IVc, Table S7). Between ages of 5–11 years in boys and 8.25–11 years in girls, height SDS plateaued and decreased beyond the age of 11 years, with a steeper slope observed in children with obesity.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^e2654f42]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Lastly, although not measured in our study cohorts, predictions based on current height and bone age remain powerful indicators of final adult height. In fact, in a few cases where bone age-based predictors were evaluated, the proportion of variance explained by a combination of current height, chronological age, and bone age exceeded 60% at age 3 in both boys and girls and continued increasing toward > 99% by age 17, while the mid-parental height or the polygenic risk score alone could only account for approximately 40% of the total variance in sex-specific analyses. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that bone age-based predictors (eg, the Tanner-Whitehouse predictors) might also benefit from adding a genetic predictor, particularly for children with an extremely short or tall stature. Notably, a genetically predicted height is not sensitive to pubertal patterns (early or late puberty), which typically affect bone maturation, and this predictor could be computed as early as at birth, whereas adult height predictions based on bone age are not precise before the age of 3 years. For all the previously discussed reasons and given the decreasing costs and increased accessibility of genomewide genotyping, we anticipate that a genetically predicted height may play a larger role in informing clinical decisions in the future.

### Factors associated with child stunting, wasting, and underweight in 35 low-and middle-income countries [^6bbe2f73]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Maternal nutritional status (height and BMI) and poor household socioeconomic conditions (household wealth and maternal education) were the leading factors associated with child anthropometric failures in our pooled analyses. Fathers' nutritional status also appeared to be associated with child anthropometric status, but paternal education was not. Despite some exceptions, parental nutritional status and poor household socioeconomic conditions were the strongest factors in most countries. The relative significance and absolute magnitude of other factors, such as care-seeking behaviors, reproductive care, and air quality, showed considerable heterogeneity among countries.

A rich volume of observational studies supports our findings regarding maternal height and BMI, but paternal anthropometry remains largely unexplored. The associations between short parental height and child anthropometric status may be attributed to both shared genetic background and common environmental determinants (eg, diet, culture, social class) that first affect parents during their early childhood and subsequently affect the growth of their offspring. The consistent association between maternal BMI and child anthropometric failures may be attributed to intrauterine intergenerational transmission of low maternal BMI during pregnancy, giving infants a high risk of low birth weight and being small for gestational age, which forms the fetal origins of subsequent childhood undernutrition. While we did not have data on maternal BMI during pregnancy, BMI at the time of the survey is likely to be associated with previous weight. The influence of maternal BMI on child anthropometric status attenuated only moderately after adding paternal BMI.

### Predicting human height by victorian and genomic methods [^0444326a]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

In the Victorian era, Sir Francis Galton showed that 'when dealing with the transmission of stature from parents to children, the average height of the two parents,… is all we need care to know about them' (1886). One hundred and twenty-two years after Galton's work was published, 54 loci showing strong statistical evidence for association to human height were described, providing us with potential genomic means of human height prediction. In a population-based study of 5748 people, we find that a 54-loci genomic profile explained 4–6% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and had limited ability to discriminate tall/short people, as characterized by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). In a family-based study of 550 people, with both parents having height measurements, we find that the Galtonian mid-parental prediction method explained 40% of the sex- and age-adjusted height variance, and showed high discriminative accuracy. We have also explored how much variance a genomic profile should explain to reach certain AUC values. For highly heritable traits such as height, we conclude that in applications in which parental phenotypic information is available (eg, medicine), the Victorian Galton's method will long stay unsurpassed, in terms of both discriminative accuracy and costs. For less heritable traits, and in situations in which parental information is not available (eg, forensics), genomic methods may provide an alternative, given that the variants determining an essential proportion of the trait's variation can be identified.

### Final height in patients with constitutional delay of growth and development from tall statured families [^f0d0c5d6]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Constitutional delay of growth and development occurs not only in children of short statured families but also in children of tall statured families. We represent the final height from 12 boys and 21 girls cared for CDGD. The mean target height for boys was 186.6 cm and for girls 173.6 cm and final heights were 191.2 and 176.9 cm, respectively. The final height of 14 patients exceeded the mean target height by more than 4 cm, nine patients exceeded the familial target height range. Only one boy did not reach the familial target height range. We conclude that CDGD occurs in equal quantities in boys and in girls irrespective of the familial height score and will lead to normal final heights within the familial target height range. In general, no therapy is necessary to alter the progression of CDGD.

### Height assessments in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^82c2e3e0]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are shorter than their unaffected counterparts. Unfortunately, these reports did not consider other contributing factors that might also influence short stature. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the genetic influence of NF1 on the growth of children. Height data were measured and recorded for 170 patients, whereas parental measurements were obtained for 61 patients to calculate sex-corrected mid-parental target heights. Children with NF1 had population mean height and mid-parental height z scores statistically different from the general population. Importantly, these differences were pronounced when neither parent had NF1 but were not significant when one of the parents had NF1. Moreover, height z scores for children with NF1 were also statistically different than their unaffected siblings. Collectively, these data establish a clear effect of a germline NF1 gene mutation on stature in children with NF1.

Children at increased risk for overweight and obesity — evidence overview: Certain populations of children who are of normal weight are at risk for developing overweight and obesity as they grow older, and epidemiologic associations suggest that primary care providers should be alert to increasing BMI trends and excessive weight gain beyond what is anticipated for height increase or pubertal change and should consider intervention before the child becomes overweight. From observational studies summarized for these Guidelines, sample populations at special risk include children with BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles and children in whom there is a positive family history of obesity in one or both parents.

### Parents' perceptions of their child's weight among children in their first year of primary school: a mixed-methods analysis of an Australian cross-sectional (complete enumeration) study [^8aa7cdd8]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative analysis

Parental comments were generally explanatory in nature providing further details about why parents were or were not concerned about their child's height or weight. However common themes differed amongst those children later measured as having BMIs that were underweight, healthy or overweight/obese.

For those children whose BMI was measured in the underweight category parent comments were often simple explanations of known issues that might explain underweight;

"Had gastrostomy until 2 yrs of age. Hx failure to thrive. Has multiple specialists in Sydney".

but also included justifications of why parents had stated they did not have concerns;

"he is a slight build & quite little, but he eats well, it is not uncommon for Filipinos".

Parents of children whose measured BMI was in the healthy range included comments which indicated that parents were actively concerned their child was underweight;

"I'm trying to put some weight on him".

"Just needs to put on maybe 2–4 kilos to be healthy".

Others displayed uncertainty about what was normal or healthy;

"Probably underweight. Can see one bone protrude-is that normal?"

There were three common themes found in the comments of parents of children who had a high BMI (overweight or obese category). Many parents described family traits or body type as if for justification or explanation;

"Big and tall for his age- genetically all family members on dad's side are built tall/solid build".

Some parents provided information about medical issues which would affect BMI;

"His epilepsy medication can have an effect on his weight. Paediatrician is happy".

Others explained actions they were taking to address a concern about height or weight;

"We have a family history of being overweight. We are very conscious of this; she still has trouble in this area & would love some help with this"

"We had some concerns about her weight-addressing through exercise & healthy choices".

Parents of children whose measured BMI was in the overweight/obese category also wrote comments which displayed an awareness of, but scepticism about BMI as an indicator that could/would apply to their child;

"Is very tall for her age and eats accordingly. I don't like that her BMI states she is obese and I feel that her height and weight are in comparison"

"Very active, eats healthily, short and solid. BMI is not a true indicator in this instance".

These comments were not present from parents with children with healthy or low BMI.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^82a66a6e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Adult height is highly heritable, yet no genetic predictor has demonstrated clinical utility compared to mid-parental height.

Objective

To develop a polygenic risk score for adult height and evaluate its clinical utility.

Design

A polygenic risk score was constructed based on meta-analysis of genomewide association studies and evaluated on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.

Subjects

Participants included 442 599 genotyped White British individuals in the UK Biobank and 941 genotyped child-parent trios of European ancestry in the ALSPAC cohort.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Standing height was measured using stadiometer; Standing height 2 SDs below the sex-specific population average was considered as short stature.

Results

Combined with sex, a polygenic risk score captured 71.1% of the total variance in adult height in the UK Biobank. In the ALSPAC cohort, the polygenic risk score was able to identify children who developed adulthood short stature with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84, which is close to that of mid-parental height. Combining this polygenic risk score with mid-parental height or only one of the child's parent's height could improve the AUROC to at most 0.90. The polygenic risk score could also substitute mid-parental height in age-specific Khamis-Roche height predictors and achieve an equally strong discriminative power in identifying children with a short stature in adulthood.

Conclusions

A polygenic risk score could be considered as an alternative or adjunct to mid-parental height to improve screening for children at risk of developing short stature in adulthood in European ancestry populations.

### Height matters-from monogenic disorders to normal variation [^b38b6960]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Height is a classic polygenic quantitative trait with a high level of heritability. As it is a simple and stable parameter to measure, height is a model for both common, complex disorders and monogenic, Mendelian disease. In this Review, we examine height from the perspective of monogenic and complex genetics and discuss the lessons learned so far. We explore several examples of rare sequence variants with large effects on height and compare these variants to the common variants identified in genome-wide association studies that have small effects on height. We discuss how copy number changes or genetic interactions might contribute to the unidentified aspects of the heritability of height. We also ask whether information derived from genome-wide association studies on specific loci in the vicinity of genes can be used for further research in clinical paediatric endocrinology. Furthermore, we address key challenges that remain for gene discovery and for the transition of moving from genomic localization to mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on using next-generation sequencing to identify causative variants of people at the extremes of height distribution.

A simple way to predict a child's stature in adulthood, with 95% confidence interval of about ± 9 cm, is to assume that the child's centile will remain unchanged after the age of 2 years. This prediction works better for children measured before puberty, and could be optimized by taking bone age into the account. Another approach is to adjust for parental stature, where the child's target stature at age 20 is the mean of the biological parents' stature (midparental stature) adjusted for sex (+ 7 cm for boys; and -7 cm for girls), with a range of 10 cm above and below this adjusted target stature. The latter approach is useful to investigate relatively short children in tall families, where the target range represents the predicted child's growth in family-conditioned centile terms, and deviating from this range indicates a growth disorder.

Secular stature trends are greater in childhood compared to adulthood because later generations are not only taller, but also more mature, than earlier generations of the same age. Data from northern and southeastern Europe suggest an increment of stature up to 3 cm per decade. Unfortunately, estimating the secular trend of stature is not applicable in our case, as there are no previous studies on the Syrian population to compare with. (Table 2) summarizes the stature conditioned for age and sex in terms of centiles tabulated against annual intervals of age, see (Additional file 1) for monthly estimates.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^6f7d5a7b]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean height for age. The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination, plotting serial height measurements on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World Health Organization growth charts, calculating estimated adult height and comparing it with midparental height, determining bone age, and laboratory testing in select patients. The most common causes of short stature are constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic etiologies are less common and include nutritional deficiencies, systemic disease, growth hormone deficiencies, and genetic abnormalities. Common causes of tall stature include constitutional advancement of growth, familial tall stature, and obesity. Uncommon etiologies of tall stature include precocious puberty, Marfan syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Referral to pediatric endocrinology is indicated in patients with idiopathic short stature for management of select genetic and metabolic conditions and for interventions to correct growth.

### Children's psychosocial functioning and parents' quality of life in paediatric short stature: the mediating role of caregiving stress [^63b8eda7]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

On the basis of the multidimensional model of the caregiving process, this study aimed (a) to compare the levels of quality of life (QoL) and psychological problems of children with short stature and the levels of caregiving stress and QoL of their parents, between diagnostic, treatment, and current height deviation groups, and (b) to examine the direct and indirect links, via caregiving stress, between children's psychosocial functioning and their parents' QoL.

Method

The sample was collected in 5 European countries and comprised 238 dyads of 8- to 18-year-old children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature and one of their parents. The children completed self-report measures of height-related QoL (Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth Core Module) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire); the parents reported on their own QoL (EUROHIS-QOL-8 Index) and caregiving stress (Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth Effects on Parents subscale).

Results

Children who were treated and who achieved normal height reported better QoL compared to those untreated and with current short stature. Parents of children with idiopathic short stature and current short stature presented greater caregiving stress than parents of children with growth hormone deficiency and achieved normal height. Children's better psychosocial functioning was indirectly associated with parents' better QoL, via less caregiving stress, and these links were invariant across diagnoses, treatment status, and current height deviation.

Conclusions

These results suggest that, along with growth hormone treatments, multidisciplinary interventions in paediatric endocrinology should be family-centred, by targeting both the children's psychosocial functioning and the parents' stress, in order to improve individual and family adaptation.

### A saturated map of common genetic variants associated with human height [^0fa797c5]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Within-family prediction

The prediction accuracy of sibling's height was assessed in 17,942 unrelated sibling pairs from the UKB. Those pairs were determined by intersecting the list of UKB sibling pairs determined by Bycroft et al.with a list of genetically determined European ancestry participants from the UKB also described previously. We then filtered the resulting list for SNP-based genetic relationship between members of different families to be smaller than 0.05. The prediction accuracy of parental height (each parent and their average) was assessed in 981 unrelated trios obtained as described above by crossing information from Bycroft et al.(calling of relatives) with that from Yengo et al.(calling of European ancestry participants). We quantified the within-family variance explained by PGS as the squared correlation of height difference between siblings with PGS difference between siblings. We describe in Supplementary Note 4 how familial information and PGS were combined to generate a single predictor.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^d878cf35]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we generated a polygenic risk score and demonstrated that it could successfully predict adult height in a population of healthy children. Our findings support the use of this genetic predictor in certain settings as an alternative or in combination with traditional adult height predictors, such as mid-parental height, and possibly also with bone age-based methods to enhance screening for children at risk for short stature in adulthood.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^0d99f82b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

It has long been recognized that height is heritable, and height has been a subject of study for at least several centuries. In the 18th century, Francis Galton first formally established that a child's height is on average strongly correlated with midparental height, with only mild regression to the mean, suggesting that genetics play a large role in height determination (i.e. high heritability). The genetic basis of height continues to be the subject of intense interest owing to its role as a model genetic trait because it displays a nearly prototypical bell-shaped distribution, is highly heritable, and is easily studied in large numbers: It is simple to measure accurately, and adult height is quite stable over time. Understanding the genetic architecture of height — the number of genetic variants that contribute to variation in height, their frequencies in the population, and the magnitude of each genetic variant's effect (i.e. effect sizes) — can teach us lessons about how to study the genetic underpinnings of other complex genetic traits and disease. Moreover, understanding the genetics of height can illuminate the underlying biology of human growth and provide insight into disorders of growth, such as short stature.

In this review, we summarize key findings of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for height and growth-related traits, with particular focus on the biological insights that these studies have generated. We will discuss the implications of height GWAS results for clinicians in terms of adult height prediction and understanding Mendelian growth disorders.

### Evolutionary conserved networks of human height identify multiple mendelian causes of short stature [^d760ebed]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

If we were to consider only the 13 high-confidence candidates, this would yield an exome sequencing detection rate of 15% in highly selected families in whom known causes were previously excluded. This probably constitutes an underestimation as we assume that some of the other 50 candidate genes may be confirmed in subsequent studies. We may have missed smaller structural variants, variants in noncoding or insufficiently covered regions, or epigenetic changes, which have also been reported in connection with short stature. Furthermore, polygenic inheritance, mating selection and familial height variability may have hampered the clinical characterization of, and hence the identification of, the underlying variant.

In conclusion, we identified and characterized 13 high-confidence candidate genes with variants in two or more independent families and another 50 medium-confidence candidate genes. Of these candidate genes, 95% are annotated with functions, pathways and other biological features that are significantly enriched among 1,025 growth-associated genes. These results illustrate that in entities with extremely high heterogeneity and complexity, such as growth defects, clinical characterization and variant-level and gene-level information need to be combined to identify candidate genes. Our study also suggests that single gene defects are an important contributor to the extreme lower end of the growth distribution.

### Adult height variants affect birth length and growth rate in children [^4a44bfb1]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Average growth trajectories were plotted for simulated individuals with the 10th and 90th percentile of the proportion of tall alleles. We predicted individual heights at exactly 1, 3 and 10 years of age for all children, to enable us to plot heights by genotype for these exact ages, from a multi-level model that did not include the genetic terms. These measures of height at age 10 years were also used to assess the aggregate associations with individual SNPs (and allelic score), by regressing against the genotype with sex as a covariate (carried out in Stata 11.1).

To investigate the hypothesis that the associations of the allelic score with growth rates would be stronger in those of smaller birth length, we divided the sample into thirds of birth length. We ran separate multilevel models for each third of birth length and examined the effect of the allelic score within each group. We tested for statistical evidence of differing effects of allelic score between thirds of birth length by carrying out a heterogeneity test on the resulting coefficients.

### Recent progress in the study of the genetics of height [^d4146b01]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Adult height is a classic polygenic trait of high narrow-sense heritability (h (2) = 0.8). In the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, variation in adult height was used as a model to set the foundation of the fields of statistics and quantitative genetics. More recently, with our increasing knowledge concerning the extent of genetic variation in the human genome, human geneticists have used genome-wide association studies to identify hundreds of loci robustly associated with adult height, providing new insights into human growth and development, and into the architecture of complex human traits. In this review, I highlight the progress made in the last 2 years in understanding how genetic variation controls height variation in humans, including non-Caucasian populations and children.

### Short stature for the general pediatrician [^9a4ade76]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Short stature (SS) is among the most common reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinology clinic, particularly in urban areas. An appropriate medical history, including family history with measurement of the parents, an evaluation of the growth chart, an appropriate review of systems and physical exam, and determining the bone age, will allow the clinician to have a clear understanding of the reason(s) why the child is short. Familial SS and constitutional delay of growth are the most common causes of short stature. Children who are small for gestational age, whose height are not normal by age 2 years, and have dysmorphic features or abnormal body proportions should have an evaluation for genetic causes of SS. Children with abnormal growth velocity should be evaluated for endocrinopathies, inflammatory conditions, intestinal malabsorption, environmental factors, and/or chromosome mosaicism. Treatment of the identified cause should restore normal growth. Growth hormone treatment is only required by a minority of patients with SS.

### Validation of the Greek version of the quality of life in short stature youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire [^f256cec7]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background The Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire is a condition-specific instrument for measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in short statured children/adolescents from patients' and parents' perspectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire. Methods The original European QoLISSY scales were translated into Greek following the guidelines for linguistic validation and applied to 184 dyads of children 8–18 years old and their parents, as well as to 14 parents of children 4–7 years old in Greece. The field testing responses to the Greek version of QoLISSY were analyzed. Results The qualitative analysis of the Greek data provided results consistent with the European sample. The subsequent field test showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α between 0.67–0.93) and high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] ≥ 0.70). Correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN questionnaire indicated good convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) also yielded acceptable results. Higher HRQoL for taller children suggests that QoLISSY was able to detect significant height-related differences. Conclusions The Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire is psychometrically sound and its use is recommended in further clinical research to ascertain the impact of short stature (SS) and treatments in Greek children/adolescents and families.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^2bee4c03]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Short stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations below the mean for age (less than the 3rd percentile). Tall stature is defined as a height more than two standard deviations above the mean for age (greater than the 97th percentile). The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include a history and physical examination, accurate serial measurements, and determination of growth velocity, midparental height, and bone age. Common normal variants of short stature are familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic causes of short stature include chronic diseases; growth hormone deficiency; and genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome. Tall stature has the same prevalence as short stature, but it is a much less common reason for referral to subspecialty care. Common causes of tall stature include familial tall stature, obesity, Klinefelter syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and precocious puberty. Although most children with short or tall stature have variants of normal growth, children who are more than three standard deviations from the mean for age are more likely to have underlying pathology. Evaluation for pathologic etiologies is guided by history and physical examination findings.

### The heritability of body composition [^a8891cf1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this investigation into the relationship between the body composition of healthy children and adolescents to their parents was a sex-dependent interaction between body composition parameters of the subjects and their parents. The muscle index (sarcopenic index) of prepubertal children was associated with that of both parents, while only the boys' adiposity indices (total and truncal fat percentage and muscle-to-fat ratio) were associated with those of their mothers. Interestingly, there was no association between muscle and adiposity parameters of adolescents and those of their parents, pointing towards environmental influences that prevail over the genetic influences seen in prepubertal children.

In line with previous reports, we found a strong association between the current height status of the subjects and their genetic height. The weight status of the subjects in our study, as expressed by the BMI z-score, was also observed to be a heritable trait, but to a lesser degree, suggesting a more diverse phenotypic variation. However, BMI is a poor proxy for adiposity and it does not distinguish muscle from adipose tissue, nor does it describe the distribution of adipose tissue. Further study that focuses on the heritability of body composition may provide insight into metabolic and cardiovascular health outcomes.

The strong interactions between prepubertal children and their parents demonstrated in this study were seen in the parameter of height-adjusted muscle mass (sarcopenic index). Variation in skeletal muscle traits among individuals can be attributed to genetic factors, environmental factors, or some interaction of both. The influence of environmental factors, such as physical activity and diet, have been broadly investigated. More recent studies have begun to identify the specific genetic influences on skeletal muscle traits that may explain the inter-individual trait variability. Studies on muscle strength have reported distinct heritable patterns, with an increasing role of the environmental factors with age. Family studies have estimated that heritability of the muscle mass indices ranged from 55 to 80%. Recent GWAS studies have identified novel loci which determine lean body mass, thus revealing the genetic basis behind the clinical inspections. Environmental influences with time may disconnect the interaction between muscle indices of adolescents and their parents.

### Inaccuracy of stated versus measured parental heights [^2a872390]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Routine measurement of children's height is essential in monitoring for deviations in normal growth velocity. Target adult height of children is estimated by determining an adjusted midparental height. Such determinations are dependent on the accurate acquisition of parental height. Incorrect assessment of parental height will result in inaccurate expectations for the child's height. To observe the difference between stated and measured parental heights within a United States subspecialty setting, prospective acquisition of parental stated and measured heights during the summer months of 2000 and 2001 was examined. Two hundred and thirty-eight parents, 185 mothers and 53 fathers, were measured. The mean values of the stated heights for mothers and fathers were 163.7 cm ± 6.3 cm and 177.1 cm ± 8.6 cm, respectively. The corresponding measured heights were 163.0 cm ± 5.9 cm and 175.2 cm ± 6.6 cm, respectively. The mean height difference for mothers was 0.69 cm (p < 0.001) while the mean height difference for fathers was 1.90 cm (p < 0.001). Parents significantly overestimate their height in a clinical setting. Fathers overestimate to a greater degree than mothers. These findings emphasize the need to obtain height measurement of parents along with that of their children in assessing for linear growth delay.

### Growth hormone treatment in children with short stature: impact of the diagnosis on parents [^ac761bf6]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This prospective multicenter study aimed (1) to examine changes in parent-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with short stature and the effects of the children's condition on parents themselves within the first year of human growth hormone (hGH) treatment and (2) to predict effects on parents based on main and interaction effects of children's HRQOL and increase in height.

Methods

A total of 110 parents of children aged 4–18 years, diagnosed with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency, small for gestational age, or idiopathic short stature, were recruited from 11 participating German pediatric endocrinologists and asked to fill out the short stature-specific Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) Questionnaire before hGH treatment was initiated and one year later.

Results

Negative effects of the children's short stature on the parents decrease over time, independent of diagnosis and treatment status. Furthermore, treatment status and height increase moderated the links between children's improved HRQOL as perceived by their parents and decreased caregiving burden.

Conclusions

Based on the children's improved HRQOL and the parent's decrease in caregiving burden, patient-reported outcomes that consider parental and child's perspectives should be considered when deciding on hGH treatment for children.

### Epigenetic and genetic components of height regulation [^9fae9477]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Parent-of-origin effects and genomic imprinting have been shown to contribute to variation in complex traits in both animal models and humans. As the vast majority of GWAS cannot assign parent-of-origin to an allele, there have been few reported GWASs of complex traits that apply parent-of-origin specific models, and we are aware of only one such association with height.

Adult height is to some extent determined by factors in utero and numerous imprinted genes are essential for regulating fetal growth and placental development. It is therefore of interest to assess the effect of adult height variants on birth length.

Here, we search for sequence variants associated with adult height in the Icelandic population and their effect on birth length using parent-of-origin, additive and recessive models.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^eb72d0fc]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents whose heights and growth velocities deviate from the normal percentiles on standard growth charts present a special challenge to physicians. Height that is less than the 3rd percentile or greater than the 97th percentile is deemed short or tall stature, respectively. A growth velocity outside the 25th to 75th percentile range may be considered abnormal. Serial height measurements over time documented on a growth chart are key in identifying abnormal growth. Short or tall stature is usually caused by variants of a normal growth pattern, although some patients may have serious underlying pathologies. A comprehensive history and physical examination can help differentiate abnormal growth patterns from normal variants and identify specific dysmorphic features of genetic syndromes. History and physical examination findings should guide laboratory testing.

Overall, ancestry-specific PGS HM3 consistently outperform their corresponding PGS GWS in most ancestry-groups. However, PGS HM3 was sometimes less transferable across ancestry groups than PGS GWS, in particular in AFR and HIS individuals from PAGE. In EUR, PGS HM3 reaches an accuracy of 44.7% (s.e. 0.6%), which is higher than previously published SNP-based predictors of height derived from individual-level data – and from GWAS summary statistics, across various experimental designs (different SNP sets, different sample sizes and so on). Finally, the largest improvement of PGS HM3 over PGS GWS was observed in AFR individuals from the PAGE study (= 8.5% versus = 15.4%; Fig. 4a) and the UKB (= 8.5% versus = 14.4%; Fig. 4a).

Furthermore, we sought to evaluate the prediction accuracy of PGSs relative to that of familial information as well as the potential improvement in accuracy gained from combining both sources of information. We analysed 981 unrelated EUR trios (that is, two parents and one child) and 17,492 independent EUR sibling pairs from the UKB, who were excluded from our META FE. We found that height of any first-degree relative yields a prediction accuracy between 25% and 30% (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the accuracy of the parental average is around 43.8% (s.e. 3.2%), which is lower than yet not significantly different from the accuracy of PGS HM3-EUR in EUR. In addition, we found that a linear combination of the average height of parents and of the child's PGS yields an accuracy of 54.2% (s.e. 3.2%) with PGS GWS-EUR and 55.2% (s.e. 3.2%) with PGS HM3-EUR. This observation reflects the fact that PGSs can explain within-family differences between siblings, whereas average parental height cannot. To show this empirically, we estimate that our PGSs based on GWS SNPs explain around 33% (s.e. 0.7%) of height variance between siblings (Methods). Finally, we show that the optimal weighting between parental average and PGS can be predicted theoretically as a function of the prediction accuracy of the PGS, the full narrow sense heritability and the phenotypic correlation between spouses (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 20).

### Explainable predictive models of short stature and exploration of related environmental growth factors: a case-control study [^f5d2d167]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

This study also has several limitations. (1) One limitation of this study is the regional sampling source, which may not be nationally representative of the population. Due to the limitations of the sample, there is an imbalance between the case and control groups regarding their place of residence and the education level of caregivers. Further sampling across regions and ethnicities is needed to ensure experimental accuracy; (2) most information, such as anthropometric measurements, children's eating and sleeping habits, and parenting habits, was obtained through interview questionnaires rather than direct measurements, potentially introducing recall bias; and (3) the sample size was small, and separate analyses were not conducted on children of different genders. A larger study is needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the growth and development history of children and to maximize the discovery of potential disease factors. (4) This case‒control study cannot clarify causal relationships. A large cohort study should comprehensively investigate the factors affecting NVSS.

### Family pediatrics: report of the task force on the family [^7bf1f5e4]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

WHY A TASK FORCE ON THE FAMILY? The practice of pediatrics is unique among medical specialties in many ways, among which is the nearly certain presence of a parent when health care services are provided for the patient. Regardless of whether parents or other family members are physically present, their influence is pervasive. Families are the most central and enduring influence in children's lives. Parents are also central in pediatric care. The health and well-being of children are inextricably linked to their parents' physical, emotional and social health, social circumstances, and child-rearing practices. The rising incidence of behavior problems among children attests to some families' inability to cope with the increasing stresses they are experiencing and their need for assistance. When a family's distress finds its voice in a child's symptoms, pediatricians are often parents' first source for help. There is enormous diversity among families-diversity in the composition of families, in their ethnic and racial heritage, in their religious and spiritual orientation, in how they communicate, in the time they spend together, in their commitment to individual family members, in their connections to their community, in their experiences, and in their ability to adapt to stress. Within families, individuals are different from one another as well. Pediatricians are especially sensitive to differences among children-in their temperaments and personalities, in their innate and learned abilities, and in how they view themselves and respond to the world around them. It is remarkable and a testament to the effort of parents and to the resilience of children that most families function well and most children succeed in life. Family life in the United States has been subjected to extensive scrutiny and frequent commentary, yet even when those activities have been informed by research, they tend to be influenced by personal experience within families and by individual and cultural beliefs about how society and family life ought to be. The process of formulating recommendations for pediatric practice, public policy, professional education, and research requires reaching consensus on some core values and principles about family life and family functioning as they affect children, knowing that some philosophic disagreements will remain unresolved. The growing multicultural character of the country will likely heighten awareness of our diversity. Many characteristics of families have changed during the past 3 to 5 decades. Families without children younger than 18 years have increased substantially, and they are now the majority. The average age at marriage has increased, and a greater proportion of births is occurring to women older than 30 years. Between 1970 and 2000, the proportion of children in 2-parent families decreased from 85% to 69%, and more than one quarter (26%) of all children live with a single parent, usually their mother. Most of this change reflects a dramatic increase in the rate of births to unmarried women that went from 5.3% in 1960 to 33.2% in 2000. Another factor in this change is a slowly decreasing but still high divorce rate that is roughly double what it was in the mid-1950s. Family income is strongly related to children's health, and the financial resources that families have available are closely tied to changes in family structure. Family income in real dollars has trended up for many decades, but the benefits have not been shared equally. For example, the median income of families with married parents has increased by 146% since 1970, but female-headed households have experienced a growth of 131%. More striking is that in 2000, the median income of female-headed households was only 47% of that of married-couple families and only 65% of that of families with 2 married parents in which the wife was not employed. Not surprising, the proportion of children who live in poverty is approximately 5 times greater for female-headed families than for married-couple families. The comped families than for married-couple families. The composition of children's families and the time parents have for their children affect child rearing. Consequent to the increase in female-headed households, rising economic and personal need, and increased opportunities for women, the proportion of mothers who are in the workforce has climbed steadily over the past several decades. Currently, approximately two thirds of all mothers with children younger than 18 years are employed. Most families with young children depend on child care, and most child care is not of good quality. Reliance on child care involves longer days for children and families, the stress imposed by schedules and created by transitions, exposure to infections, and considerable cost. An increasing number and proportion of parents are also devoting time previously available to their children to the care of their own parents. The so-called "sandwich generation" of parents is being pulled in multiple directions. The amount and use of family time also has changed with a lengthening workday, including the amount of commuting time necessary to travel between work and home, and with the intrusion of television and computers into family life. In public opinion polls, most parents report that they believe it is more difficult to be a parent now than it used to be; people seem to feel more isolated, social and media pressures on and enticements of their children seem greater, and the world seems to be a more dangerous place. Social and public policy has not kept up with these changes, leaving families stretched for time and stressed to cope and meet their responsibilities. What can and what should pediatrics do to help families raise healthy and well-adjusted children? How can individual pediatricians better support families? FAMILY PEDIATRICS: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Board of Directors appointed the Task Force on the Family to help guide the development of public policy and recommend how to assist pediatricians to promote well-functioning families (see Appendix). The magnitude of the assigned work required task force members to learn a great deal from research and researchers in the fields of social and behavioral sciences. A review of some critical literature was completed by a consultant to the task force and accompanies this report. That review identified a convergence of pediatrics and research on families by other disciplines. The task force found that a great deal is known about family functioning and family circumstances that affect children. With this knowledge, it is possible to provide pediatric care in a way that promotes successful families and good outcomes for children. The task force refers to that type of care as "family-oriented care" or "family pediatrics" and strongly endorses policies and practices that promote the adoption of this 2-generational approach as a hallmark of pediatrics. During the past decade, family advocates have successfully promoted family-centered care, "the philosophies, principles and practices that put the family at the heart or center of services; the family as the driving force". Most pediatricians report that they involve families in the decision making regarding the health care of their child and make an effort to understand the needs of the family as well as the child. Family pediatrics, like family-centered care, requires an active, productive partnership between the pediatrician and the family. But family pediatrics extends the responsibilities of the pediatrician to include screening, assessment, and referral of parents for physical, emotional, or social problems or health risk behaviors that can adversely affect the health and emotional or social well-being of their child. FAMILY CONTEXT OF CHILD HEALTH: The power and importance of families to children arises out of the extended duration for which children are dependent on adults to meet their basic needs. Children's needs for which only a family can provide include social support, socialization, and coping and life skills. Their self-esteem grows from being cared for, loved, and valued and feeling that they are part of a social unit that shares values, communicates openly, and provides companionship. Families transmit and interpret values to their children and often serve as children's connection to the larger world, especially during the early years of life. Although schools provide formal education, families teach children how to get along in the world. Often, efforts to discuss families and make recommendations regarding practice or policy stumble over disagreements about the definition of a family. The task force recognized the diversity of families and chose not to operate from the position of a fixed definition. Rather, the task force, which was to address pediatrics, decided to frame its deliberations and recommendations around the functions of families and how various aspects of the family context influence child rearing and child health. One model of family functioning that implicitly guided the task force is the family stress model (Fig 1). Stress of various sorts (eg, financial or health problems, lack of social support, unhappiness at work, unfortunate life events) can cause parents emotional distress and cause couples conflict and difficulty with their relationship. These responses to stress then disrupt parenting and the interactions between parent and child and can lead to short-term or lasting poor outcomes. The earlier these events transpire and the longer that the disruption lasts, the worse the outcomes for children. The task force favors efforts to encourage and support marriage yet recognizes that every family constellation can produce good outcomes for children and that none is certain to yield bad ones.

### A polygenic risk score to predict future adult short stature among children [^e6efb32c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Polygenic Risk Score Achieved Comparable Predictive Performance as Mid-parental Height to Predict Final Adult Height

In the UK Biobank test set consisting of 81 902 individuals (Table 1), in combination with age, sex, recruitment center, genotyping array, and the first 20 genetic principal components (to account for population stratification), a polygenic risk score was able to capture 71.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 70.8%-71.4%] of the total variance in measured adult height (supplementary notes and Supplementary Figure 1 in). In the ALSPAC cohort, among 941 children for whom mid-parental height prediction was available (Table 1), the polygenic risk score, together with sex, explained 71.0% (95% CI: 67.9%-74.1%) of the total variance in adult height (Fig. 2A). This value was similar to the 72.6% (69.6%-75.6%) variance explained by mid-parental height (Fig. 2B) and was consistent in 541 females [adjusted R² = 38.5% (95% CI: 32.1%-44.9%) for the polygenic risk score vs 41.8% (95% CI: 35.5%-48.1%) for mid-parental height] and 400 males [adjusted R² = 37.9% (95% CI: 30.%5–45.4%) for the polygenic risk score vs 45.0% (95% CI: 37.8–52.1%) by mid-parental height]. Meanwhile, the polygenic risk score had an overall prediction RMSE of 4.96 cm, marginally higher than that of the mid-parental height (4.82 cm; Supplementary Figure 2A in).

### Accuracy of self-reported height measurements in parents and its effect on mid-parental target height calculation [^4e6e2183]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical determination of mid-parental height is an important part of the assessment of a child's growth, however our clinical impression has been that parents cannot be relied upon to accurately report their own heights. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the accuracy of parental height self-reporting and its effect on calculated mid-parental target height for children presenting to a pediatric endocrinology office.

Methods

All parents bringing their children for an initial evaluation to a pediatric endocrinology clinic over a period of nine months were questioned and then measured by a pediatric endocrinologist. Parents were blinded to the study. Mid-parental target heights, based on reported and actual height were compared.

Results

There were 241 families: 98 fathers and 217 mothers in our study. Mean measured paternal height was 173.2 cm, self reported 174.9 cm (p < 0.0001), partner reported 177 cm (p = 0.0004). Only 50% of fathers and 58% of mothers reported their height within ± 2 cm of their measured height, while 15% of fathers and 12% of mothers were inaccurate by more than 4 cm. Mean measured maternal height was 160.6 cm, self-reported 161.1 cm (NS), partner reported 161.7 cm (NS). Inaccuracy of height self-report had a small but significant effect on the mean MPTH (0.4 cm, p = 0.045). Analysis showed that only 70% of MPTH calculated by reported heights fell within ± 2 cm of MPTH calculated using measured heights, 24% being in ± 2–4 cm range, and 6% were inaccurate by more than 4 cm.

Conclusion

There is a significant difference in paternal measured versus reported heights with an overall trend for fathers to overestimate their own height. A large subset of parents makes a substantial error in their height self-report, which leads to erroneous MPTH. Inaccuracy is even greater when one parent reports the other parent's height. When a child's growth is in question, measured rather than reported parental heights should be obtained.

### A major gene model of adult height is suggested in Chinese [^e4ba9538]. Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Adult height (stature), as a complex quantitative trait, has been studied in different populations. However, few genetic studies on height were performed on the Chinese, the largest population in the world. In this study, familial correlation and segregation analyses were carried out for adult height in a Chinese sample composed of 385 nuclear families with a total of 1,169 informative individuals. The results suggest that a major gene with a recessive effect accounts for about 17.2% of the total adult height variation in the Chinese. Significant familial residual effects are found. The heritability (± SE) of height is estimated to be 0.647 (± 0.122). This study, for the first time, provides evidence for the high degree of genetic determination of adult height in the Chinese population and furnishes a valuable reference for further mapping and identification of adult height genes in the Chinese.

### Explainable predictive models of short stature and exploration of related environmental growth factors: a case-control study [^371cc255]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the case‒control study, we used a machine learning approach to identify the optimal model for predicting the NVSS, explained it through a SHAP plot, and investigated the influence of environmental growth factors on the NVSS. We found that the random forest model and gradient boosting machine model were the most effective predictors and that characteristics such as parental height, caregiver education, and child weight significantly impacted the prediction of NVSS. Multivariate conditional logistic regression revealed that child weight, maternal height, paternal height, sufficient nighttime sleep duration, and children's outdoor activity time of more than 3 h per day were protective factors related to a lower risk of developing NVSS.

In the present study, child weight and parental height were protective factors against a reduced risk of childhood short stature according to both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. A study by Li et al. revealed that birth weight and a family history of short stature were significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of childhood short stature. A study by Huang et al. reported similar findings. Previous studies have demonstrated that genetics significantly influences the growth and development of children and that individuals with short stature in their immediate family are much more likely to develop this disorder than those without a family history of short stature. While early menarche in mothers has been associated with certain growth patterns in offspring, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between early puberty and child growth. Early menarche in mothers may reduce the occurrence of childhood stunting due to favorable genetic backgrounds and superior living conditions. Some studies indicate that early reproductive maturity can lead to an initial increase in height during childhood, followed by an accelerated growth spurt. However, this can often result in a premature cessation of growth, ultimately leading to a shorter adult stature. For example, research has shown that early menarche is linked to shorter adult height due to this pattern of growth dynamics. Moreover, the assertion that early menarche reflects favorable growing conditions is contentious and requires careful consideration of socioeconomic and demographic factors. In particular, populations such as Black/African Americans and Hispanics, who traditionally face significant health disparities and socioeconomic challenges, tend to experience an earlier onset of puberty compared to non-Hispanic whites. This relationship complicates the notion that early menarche is solely indicative of a favorable environment, as these groups often have less access to quality healthcare, nutrition, and supportive resources that are critical for optimal growth and development. Therefore, when evaluating the impact of early menarche on growth and development, it is crucial to consider these broader contextual factors, as they can significantly influence both the timing of puberty and the overall growth trajectory of children. A nuanced understanding of these relationships can lead to more informed clinical practices aimed at supporting healthy growth among diverse populations.

### The accuracy of parent-reported height and weight for 6–12 year old U.S. children [^00ea94de]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Measured height and weight, used in national surveillance surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), are used to calculate body mass index (BMI) percentile and to provide a portrait of the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in the U.S. In-person measurement can be time- and resource-intensive. It may not always possible to obtain measured height and weight in other surveillance systems (e.g. state, county, or municipal levels) or even larger studies using remote (e.g. phone, web) data collection. Self-reported (or proxy-report such as parents reporting on their children) height and weight, have been frequently employed as substitutes for measured height and weight.

Previous studies have examined correlations between BMI calculated using parent-reported and directly-measured child height and weight and predictors of observed bias. A review by O'Connor and Gugenheim estimated that parent-reported height and weight had sensitivity for identifying children with obesity ranging from 22 to 79% and specificity ranging from 93 to 98%. While these studies each have their own strengths, they are also subject to limitations. First, many use measures of correlation such as the Pearson's correlation coefficient or paired t-tests that fail to adequately detect levels of reproducibility. Further, few studies report coefficients that can be employed to derive a correction factor for parent-reported child height and weight.

Correction factors exist for adult self-reported height and weight, but the evidence for a pediatric sample is sparse. The one correction factor reported for absolute child BMI (kg/m²) adjusts only for age; characteristics that predict variation in self-report of height and weight in adults (race/ethnicity and sex) where not included. One could speculate that parent reports of child height and weight can be additionally biased by other factors such as presence of other children in the household and continued growth over time, making it even more challenging to derive a correction factor for this young population.

### Health supervision for people with achondroplasia [^32cee1a2]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — epidemiology and inheritance — is the most common condition associated with severe, disproportionate short stature, with an estimated birth incidence of 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 30 000, and there is no recognized ethnic or sex predisposition. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with a 50% chance of transmission to offspring if the other parent is unaffected, and approximately 75% to 80% of patients are born to average-stature parents due to a new FGFR3 mutation. The average adult height is approximately 120 to 135 cm (4–4.5 ft).

### Regression to the mean in latent change score models: an example involving breastfeeding and intelligence [^1b720b88]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this article, we use the effect of breastfeeding on intergenerational change in intelligence as a case study of regression to the mean in latent change score models. The effect of breastfeeding on intelligence is controversial. Earlier studies using observational data have found that breastfed children have higher intelligence compared to those not breastfed. A risk for confounding is apparent, as breastfeeding mothers tend to be more intelligent than non-breastfeeding mothers or mothers who breastfeed only for a short period of time and because intelligence is strongly hereditary. A positive association between breastfeeding and child intelligence has indeed been shown to be less than completely attenuated when adjusting for maternal intelligence. However, since intelligence is measured with imperfect reliability, breastfeeding mothers may tend to have higher true intelligence than non-breastfeeding mothers even if they have the same measured intelligence. Hence, the remaining adjusted association between breastfeeding and child intelligence could be due to residual confounding. This example may illustrate the susceptibility of latent change score models to regression to the mean, a phenomenon which is well-understood in theory, but nevertheless often overlooked in practice.

Galton coined the term regression toward mediocrity to describe the phenomenon that tall parents tended to have tall offspring, but not quite as tall as themselves, while short parents tended to have short offspring, but not quite as short as themselves. This phenomenon, nowadays usually called regression to the mean, occurs because extreme outcomes usually require an extreme combination of causative factors, and the probability is higher for some combination of causative factors that results in a less extreme outcome. So, even if an offspring has partly inherited their parent's genome that increases the likelihood for tall/short stature, they may not experience the same extreme combination of other factors, such as nutrition, activity levels, and medical conditions, and this tends to result in a less extreme stature. An important feature of regression to the mean is that it has an effect backward as well as forward in time. Tall offspring can be expected to have tall parents, but not quite as tall as themselves, while short offspring can be expected to have short parents, but not quite as short as themselves.

### Maternal height and child growth patterns [^ccb4b790]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical Analyses

We included in the analysis all mother–child pairs with available anthropometry data in all periods (n = 7630). One or more predictors were missing for 19% of the analytic sample. We assumed the missing predictors (maternal height and household wealth) to be missing at random, and generated 5 multiple imputations (MI) using imputation chain equations. Combined estimates were obtained using MI inference rules. Analyses conducted with the available non-missing data (by list-wise deletion) had similar results but with wider CIs and, consequently, we kept the results of the MI analyses.

Maternal height was the primary exposure. Child growth (birth weight, height changes during the early, middle, and late childhood periods) and attained height (all in z-scores) were the outcome measures.

To address the challenge of collinearity of growth measures, we computed conditional height, the child-specific residual obtained from linear site-specific regression of height at each age on birth weight and all prior height measurements. Conditional height represents the change in height within a growth period relative to the child's prior height, in the context of the mean growth pattern of the population. Conditional variables are uncorrelated with each other. We used birth weight as the anchor for all conditional heights.

We defined offspring childhood stunting at 2 years as HAZ values < −2 SD. Using the same threshold of −2 SD, short stature in adulthood was defined as height < 150.1 cm among females and < 161.9 cm among males. We used study-specific measures of socioeconomic status (SES) at offspring birth, categorized into quintiles (1 = poorest) as a measure of SES during childhood. The SES quintiles are site-specific, and were estimated from maternal education and paternal occupation for India, and by asset scores for all other study sites.

### Incorporating genetic potential when evaluating stature in children with cystic fibrosis [^beed29fa]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2002 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) practice guidelines recommend adjusting for genetic potential when evaluating height status in children with CF. However, there is paucity of data to support this recommendation. We compared three methods of classifying short stature: unadjusted height percentile < 10th, Himes adjusted height percentile < 10th, and unadjusted height below the CFF target height lower bound.

Patients and Methods

Data from 3306 children with parental heights documented in the 1986–2005 CFF Patient Registry were analyzed.

Results

Mean height percentile of CF children (33rd) was lower than their parents' (mothers' 53rd, fathers' 57th), and 80% of CF children were below the average of their parental height percentiles. In children with short parents, Himes adjusted height percentile was significantly higher than unadjusted height percentile (27th vs. 8th), whereas the opposite was found in children with tall parents (Himes adjusted at 18th vs. unadjusted at 49th). Consequently, the prevalence of short stature decreased from 52% to 22% in children with short parents and increased from 8% to 34% in children with tall parents after Himes adjustment. In children with discrepant classification on short stature before and after Himes adjustment, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second was negatively associated with unadjusted height percentile but positively associated with Himes adjusted height percentile. In children with short parents, the CFF method underestimated the prevalence of short stature (9%) compared to the Himes method (22%).

Conclusion

Without adjustment of genetic potential, the prevalence of short stature is underestimated and the association between height and lung function is biased.

### Adult height variants affect birth length and growth rate in children [^cf1cd8bd]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Patterns of height and growth are controlled by a number of mechanisms, which vary from infancy into early adulthood. Although birth length does appear to have some genetic component, maternal size (determined by her genes and environment), behaviours during pregnancy and health and foetal nutrition are suggested as key determinants of birth length, whereas genetics, nutrition and illnesses affect growth more after birth. It is thought that growth in the first 2 years of life is more susceptible to environmental influences than growth later in childhood which is primarily genetically determined. GWASs have now identified SNPs robustly associated with adult height, some of which have also been shown to be associated with peak height velocity either infancy or puberty or both. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the association of these SNPs with growth trajectories from birth to 10 years, and to examine the age at which these SNPs begin to influence height and height growth.

We have shown that an allelic score derived from a set of known adult height-associated SNPs is associated with birth length and with childhood growth from ∼1 year onwards. This contrasts with earlier work from the same cohort showing that socioeconomic influences on child height operate primarily through differences in birth length, but have little effect on postnatal growth. These findings together suggest that birth length and very early growth appear to be influenced by environmental factors and somewhat by genetic factors, whereas growth later in childhood appears to be more genetically determined, consistent with the literature.

These findings suggest that the association observed in previous work between these SNPs and adult height is not just due to processes affecting later growth, such as timing, duration and velocity of the pubertal growth spurt, but that this genetic component of height is at least operating in part from before birth and increasingly so from 3 months of age. In fact whereas the original paper reported that these SNPs explain ∼10% of adult height variation, we show that by age 10 this same set of SNPs already explains ∼5% of height variation. We have purposefully modelled growth up to age 10 only to capture pre-pubertal growth; questions on age at menarche and Tanner scoring of breast, penis and pubic hair suggest that at this age the vast majority of the children (at least 95%) were pre-pubertal. Thus, our results suggest that these genetic variants are affecting pre-pubertal growth.

### Current concepts in tall stature and overgrowth syndromes [^026cfe50]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

In this overview an update is given on the pathogenesis, classification and differential diagnosis of overgrowth syndromes. In addition, height prognosis and therapeutic modalities available for managing mainly constitutional tall stature are discussed. Constitutional tall stature comprises normal variants in which one or both parents are tall. Primary disorders may have a prenatal onset and may be of chromosomal or genetic origin. Secondary overgrowth syndromes are most often the result of hormonal disturbances. Height prediction plays a key role in the management of tall children. Prediction equation models have been developed based on the growth data of healthy tall children. There is general agreement that a favourable effect on reducing ultimate height is obtained using high doses of sex steroids (girls 100–300 microg ethinyloestradiol; boys testosterone (T) ester depot preparations 250–1000 mg/month), the height reduction being greater when the treatment is started at a lower chronological and/or bone age. An alternative is the induction of puberty with low doses of sex steroids (girls 5–50 microg ethinyloestradiol; boys T esters 25–50 mg/m2/3 wk). In addition orthopaedic procedures have been suggested, but there is limited experience. Although psychosocial factors constitute the main reason for treating tall stature, extensive psychological investigations before or during height limiting therapy are lacking. Moreover, there are no objective data indicating lifelong psychosocial damage resulting from being tall.

Child with suspected short stature — clinical features and referral triggers are listed as follows: suggestive history and physical findings include "Child well below 3rd percentile for height", "Child with decreasing growth velocity – crossing percentiles down after the age of 3 years", "Child with a history of IUGR without catch-up growth by age 2", and "Syndromic appearance, abnormal body proportions". When to refer is stratified as Urgent and Routine; urgent indications are "If child is growing poorly and is having headaches or vision changes" or "If you suspect a child may have multiple hormone deficiencies", and routine indications are "Height below 3rd percentile", "Abnormal growth velocity in a child older than 3 years", and "Height potential is different than expected for the family".

### Adult height variants affect birth length and growth rate in children [^b29a480d]. Human Molecular Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the associations between the allelic score and growth may differ according to thirds of birth length, such that the effect of the allelic score on postnatal growth would be strongest in those of lower birth length (i.e. an interaction between allelic score and birth length on growth). Despite some suggestion that the effect of allelic score differs by tertile of birth length, there is little statistical evidence that the coefficients differ.

### Parental heights and maternal education as predictors of length / height of children at birth, age 3 and 19 years, independently on diet: the ELSPAC study [^f07e0852]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Little is currently known about the relationship between the parental diet during pregnancy and the growth of the child from early childhood until early adulthood. This study was designed to examine whether the dietary patterns of the parents during a pregnancy and of the respective child at 3 years are associated with the length/height-for-age z-score of child at birth, 3 years of age and at 19 years of age.

Subjects/Methods

Dietary patterns of pregnant women and their partners, and offspring at 3 years that were enroled in the 1990–1991 period in the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the relationship between the dietary patterns of parents (835 child-mother-father trios) during pregnancy and the length/height-for-age z-score of their offspring at birth, 3 years and 19 years.

Results

The maternal health-conscious food pattern was found to predict lower child height at 3 years, but not at birth nor at 19 years of age. An increase in the health-conscious pattern score of the maternal diet was associated with significantly lower height-for-age z-score at 3 years; however, the observed effect lost its significance after the adjustment for diet of the child at 3 years.

Conclusions

After full adjustment, the only significant predictors of the height-for-age z-score of the child at 3 years were the heights of both parents and maternal education. More research into the association of maternal diet in pregnancy and height of child is necessary.

Cohort characteristics

The ALSPAC cohort initially recruited 14 541 pregnant women who had an expected delivery date between April 1991 and December 1992 in the Bristol and Avon areas in the United Kingdom. Details of this prospective cohort have been described previously. Children in the ALSPAC cohort were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genotyping platforms and the genotypes were imputed to the 1 000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel. A total of 8932 samples were available for children of European ancestry. Shoeless adult standing height (at age 24), or individuals who were originally the children in the cohort, as well as shoeless standing height of both biological parents (available for 1532 children) were measured during clinical visits using a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain Ltd). Among 3078 genotyped children who had measured adult height, 941 had height measured for both biological parents (Table 1), a further 1305 only had measured maternal height, and 151 only had measured paternal height. Shoeless height and weight measures of children during puberty (between ages 8 and 17) was collected from a "Growing and Changing" questionnaire, which was distributed to participants recurrently between September 1999 and February 2010. These questionnaires were completed by either a parent or a child. The children were asked to stand barefoot straight against a wall to mark at the highest point on the head and to measure the distance from the mark on the floor. No specific instruction was provided for measuring weight. Please note that the study website contains details of all the data that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2004). Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time.

### The interaction of childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of young adult BMI [^be08ebda]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction of childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of young adult BMI. The 2,802 subjects in this study were from the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH). The subjects' heights and weights were measured in 3rd grade (mean age 8.7 years) and again in 12th grade (mean age 18.3 years). The associations and interactions between height (cm) and BMI (kg/m²) were assessed using mixed linear regression models with adult BMI as the dependent variable. We found a significant interaction between childhood height and childhood BMI in the prediction of adult BMI (P < 0.0001). Stratification by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference quintiles revealed that a positive association between childhood height and adult BMI existed only for those subjects in the top quintile of childhood BMI, within whom predicted adult BMI ranged from 27.5 (95% confidence interval = 26.4–28.6) for those in the shortest height quintile to 30.2 (95% confidence interval = 29.7–30.6) for those in the highest height quintile. Among children with high BMI levels, those who were taller, as compared to those who were shorter, had significantly higher young adult BMI levels. This pattern seems primarily due to the positive association of childhood height and childhood BMI. Clinicians should recognize the risk of excess body weight in young adulthood for all children who have a high BMI, and pay special attention to those who are tall, because their childhood height will not protect them from subsequent weight gain and elevated BMI.

### A track record on SHOX: from basic research to complex models and therapy [^d4732ce6]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

I. Introduction

Adult body height depends substantially on the length of the long bones. Bone development and longitudinal growth are highly complex developmental processes that are influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. For example, malnutrition and untreated infectious disease hinder growth. However, environmental factors account for a relatively small percentage of the height variation within a population. Instead, most of the variation is due to genetic and possibly epigenetic factors. Not surprisingly, defects in the genes involved in bone development can produce diseases with varied skeletal defects, altered bone growth, and stature below or above the mean.

Short stature is a descriptive term indicating height that is significantly below the average of the general population for that person's age and sex. More precisely, short stature is statistically defined as 2 SD below the mean population height for age and sex (less than the third percentile) or, when evaluating shortness in relation to family background, more than 2 SD below the midparental height. It affects approximately 3% of children worldwide and is therefore a condition for which clinical attention is frequently sought during childhood. This is appropriate because growth failure may be an early sign of serious renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or genetic disease.

More than 150 genes are known to be involved in the etiology of syndromes characterized by short stature. Genetic abnormalities associated with short stature include major chromosomal rearrangements, large-scale deletions or loss of a whole chromosome, and point mutations, small deletions or insertions, or copy number variation in key genes involved in bone development. Examples include mutations to SOX9 (MIM: 608160), COL2A1, and FGFR3 (MIM: 134934). (For a list of genes whose mutations are associated with short stature, we redirect the reader to the following reviews: Refs., and.) However, such known mutations appear to explain only a small percentage of growth failure cases; a high percentage of clinical conditions with short stature cases remains idiopathic. The identification of underlying gene defects in such cases will be crucial for more accurate diagnosis of growth disorders and for the development of novel tailored clinical interventions.

Materials and methods

Individuals

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). 565 individuals and their families were referred by medical specialists for evaluation of growth retardation after endocrine defects of the growth hormone pathway and other organic causes of growth retardation were excluded. After previous targeted testing including array analysis in some and exome sequencing failed to identify a known cause, we further assessed the exomes of 254 well-characterized families with at least 1 offspring whose growth standard deviation score (SDS) was ≥ 2 below the mean population height and/or the estimated family (est. height in Table 1) for potential candidate genes (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Participants' mean age (± standard deviation) was 9.2 ± 0.43 years, and 155/254 (61%) participants were female. Most index individuals (53%) presented with a height between 3 and 2 SDS below the mean, and 32% were born small for gestational age (Supplementary Figure 1). In 68/254 (27%) participants, additional features such as microcephaly, syndactyly, nail dysplasia or any nonspecific facial gestalt resulted in a diagnosis of syndromic short stature.

Prediction analyses

Height was first mean-centred and scaled to variance 1 within each sex. We quantified the prediction accuracy of height predictors as the difference between the variance explained by a linear regression model of sex-standardized height regressed on the height predictor, age, 20 genotypic principal components and study-specific covariates (full model) minus that explained by a reduced linear regression not including the height predictor. Genetic principal components were calculated from LD pruned HM3 SNPs (< 0.1). We used height of siblings or parents as a predictor of height as well as various polygenic scores (PGSs) calculated as a weighted sum of height-increasing alleles. The direction and magnitude of these weights was determined by estimated SNP effects from our discovery GWAS meta-analyses. No calibration of tuning parameters in a validation was performed.

Parental characteristics

Mid-parental height was included to account for the child's genetic height potential. Mid-parental height is calculated as the mean of mother's and father's standardised heights using British 1990 references. Where a child had missing values for maternal or paternal height, an adjustment formula was used to impute mid-parental height based on one parental height ((available parental height z score × 0.4) + 0.15). This formula was derived from MCS data using the relationship between both maternal and paternal height z score and child's height z score at age 17 years. It accounts for both the regression to the mean expected in child height compared to parental heights and the increased variance when using one parental height z score instead of the mean of both. We included mother's age at birth of the child, as well as second-hand smoke exposure ("Does smoke in the same room as [child] nowadays?") and any breastfeeding ("Did [mother] ever try to breastfeed [child]?"). Whether the mother was ever diagnosed with depression or serious anxiety was included to account for maternal mental health.

Parental socioeconomic status was assessed with a range of variables. Maternal education was included as a binary variable, with mothers who had achieved level 3 education (A levels or vocational qualification) or higher categorised as having a high level of education. A levels are completed in the UK at age 18, and 34% of UK students achieved at least one A level in 1995–1996. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is derived annually by the Office for National Statistics as a measure of small-area relative deprivation for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Census data on seven measures (including employment, access to healthcare and environment) are compiled to create the index. In the MCS, the child's postcode was used to provide IMD deciles, with children in the first decile being the most deprived and those in the 10th decile being the least deprived. The IMD was treated as continuous in these analyses. Finally, we included an imputed measure of income quintile available in the MCS dataset. Missing income values were estimated using interval regression and socioeconomic predictor variables.

### Genetic evaluation of short stature [^0664bd47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Genetics plays a major role in determining an individual's height. Although there are many monogenic disorders that lead to perturbations in growth and result in short stature, there is still no consensus as to the role that genetic diagnostics should play in the evaluation of a child with short stature.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of PubMed was performed, focusing on the genetic diagnosis of short stature as well as on specific diagnostic subgroups included in this article. Consensus guidelines were reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

There are a multitude of rare genetic causes of severe short stature. There is no high-quality evidence to define the optimal approach to the genetic evaluation of short stature. We review genetic etiologies of a number of diagnostic subgroups and propose an algorithm for genetic testing based on these subgroups.

Conclusion

Advances in genomic technologies are revolutionizing the diagnostic approach to short stature. Endocrinologists must become facile with the use of genetic testing in order to identify the various monogenic disorders that present with short stature.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to prognosis, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize the prognostic value of the following factors in ADPKD:

- the disease-causing gene influences the severity of kidney disease

- the type of PKD1 pathogenic variant influences the severity of kidney disease

- the severity of kidney disease progression in the family can guide likely outcomes in other affected family members

- male sex is a possible prognostic factor for more severe disease

- overweight and obesity are likely risk factors for faster progression of kidney disease

- a higher salt intake level is associated with faster progression of ADPKD

- height-adjusted total kidney volume predicts future decline in kidney function

- ultrasound-determined total kidney volume and kidney-length measurements have prognostic value, but they are less precise than measurements using MRI or CT.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^38e61c7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

An important distinction must be made here. Although in the general population, common variants detected by GWAS are the primary contributors to variation in height, this does not preclude a role of rare variants in an individual. Individuals with extreme heights or those with additional features, such as skeletal anomalies of other congenital malformations, are more likely to have abnormal stature as a result of a severe mutation causing a growth disorder. In these individuals, technologies such as whole exome or genome sequencing may uncover mutations in genes that cause these growth disorders, with an appreciable diagnostic yield. However, the role of these technologies in individuals with extreme stature but without any syndromic features has not been rigorously and systematically explored.

### Etiologies and early diagnosis of short stature and growth failure in children and adolescents [^5dd3aacf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of height and weight using standardized techniques is a fundamental component of pediatric medical visits. Calculation of height velocity over time enables comparison with standardized growth charts to identify potential deviations from normal. Growth deviations may be expressed as SD from the normal population mean for children of comparable age and sex; children with heights > 2 SD below the mean are generally classified as short stature. In a child with suspected impaired growth, a detailed evaluation should be conducted to identify the cause. Such an evaluation may include a combination of personal, family, and social history; physical examination; general and perhaps specialized laboratory evaluations; radiologic examinations; genetic testing; and consultation with a pediatric subspecialist, such as a pediatric endocrinologist. Variants of normal growth include familial short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, and small for gestational age with catch-up growth. Pathological causes of abnormal growth include many systemic diseases and their treatments, growth hormone deficiency, and a series of genetic syndromes, including Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome. Children with short stature in whom no specific cause is identified may be diagnosed with idiopathic short stature. Early identification of abnormal growth patterns and prompt referral to specialist care offer children with growth failure and/or short stature the greatest chance for appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and improved clinical outcomes.

### The genetic basis of human height [^86c91b85]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Human height is a model polygenic trait - additive effects of many individual variants create continuous, genetically determined variation in this phenotype. Height can also be severely affected by single-gene variants in monogenic disorders, often causing severe alterations in stature relative to population averages. Deciphering the genetic basis of height provides understanding into the biology of growth and is also of relevance to disease, as increased or decreased height relative to population averages has been epidemiologically and genetically associated with an altered risk of cancer or cardiometabolic diseases. With recent large-scale genome-wide association studies of human height reaching saturation, its genetic architecture has become clearer. Genes implicated by both monogenic and polygenic studies converge on common developmental or cellular pathways that affect stature, including at the growth plate, a key site of skeletal growth. In this Review, we summarize the genetic contributors to height, from ultra-rare monogenic disorders that severely affect growth to common alleles that act across multiple pathways.

### Child with suspected short stature [^c5f8ec97]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

Logistic regression

To reduce the possibility of missing potentially important variables, we incorporated variables that revealed statistically significant differences between cases and controls at P < 0.01 into the logistic regression analysis. Certain variables, although not reaching the level of significance in the univariate analysis, may be significant in the multivariate analysis, and to avoid missing suspicious factors, we also included all variables in the multivariate logistic regression.

In the univariate conditional logistic regression analysis (Table 6), child weight was associated with a reduced risk of NVSS, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.96), indicating that each unit increase in child weight corresponds to a 8% decrease in the odds of NVSS. Maternal height and weight also showed significant associations with NVSS, exhibiting OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.83) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98), respectively. This indicates that each unit increase in maternal height is linked to a 23% reduction in the odds of NVSS, while each unit increase in maternal weight corresponds to a 5% decrease in the odds. Similarly, paternal height exhibited an OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.82), reinforcing the genetic influence on short stature, with each unit increase linked to a 23% decrease in odds. Paternal weight, while showing a smaller effect (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96), still revealed a significant association, with each unit increase correlating to a 6% reduction in the odds of NVSS. Furthermore, eating barbecued food (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.91) is associated with an 44% decrease in the odds of NVSS, suggesting that individuals who consume barbecued food have significantly lower odds of experiencing NVSS compared to those who do not. Similarly, the intake of foreign fast food was associated with a reduced risk of NVSS, with an OR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.81), indicating that consuming foreign fast food may lead to a 52% decrease in the odds of NVSS. Child's time spent on screening devices also significantly impacted NVSS, with those spending less than 30 min showing an OR of 2.75 (95% CI: 1.02, 7.40), 1–2 h showing an OR of 2.93 (95% CI: 1.06, 8.11) and those spending more than 2 h having an OR of 6.44 (95% CI: 1.63, 25.51). This suggests that spending less than 30 min and 1–2 h on screening devices are associated with 2.75 and 2.93 times the odds of experiencing NVSS compared to those who spend less time. Similarly, spending more than 2 h correlates with 6.44 times the odds of NVSS compared to those who do not engage in such screen time. This highlights a strong link between increased screen time and a higher risk of NVSS. Additionally, spending time outdoors was shown to promote child growth, with those engaging in outdoor activities for less than 1 h having an OR of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.69), those spending 1–3 h having an OR of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.74), and those spending more than 3 h showing an OR of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.90). This indicates that spending more time outdoors is associated with a 67% reduction in the odds for less than 1 h, a 66% reduction for 1–3 h, and an 83% reduction for more than 3 h, suggesting that increased outdoor activity is linked to a lower risk of NVSS.

### Adult height and risk of 50 diseases: a combined epidemiological and genetic analysis [^d071a860]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies have associated higher adult height with lower risk of mortality from coronary artery disease (CAD) and respiratory diseases and increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), cancer and cancer in specific sites. Although such studies have typically adjusted for age, sex and some socio-economic and behavioral risk factors, the observed associations may still be due to unmeasured confounding. Height itself is determined by genetics and early-life factors, such as nutrient availability, socio-economic circumstances and diseases, and some of these can themselves impact on risk of some diseases in later life. Precise reason(s) for the association of adult height with risk of these diseases are not known. In particular, it is unclear whether the associations are primary (due to shared biological pathways affecting both adult height and risk of diseases) and not due to confounding.

Genetic approaches (Mendelian randomisation) that use genetic variants as instrumental variables have been used to test for causal relationships between exposure and disease outcomes. Genotypes are generated at conception with alleles randomly passed on from each parent and are independent of environmental and life style factors that can confound epidemiological analysis. Also, they cannot be altered by disease and therefore remove the possibility of reverse causality. Several recent studies have used a Mendelian randomisation approach to assess the relationship of height with selected diseases, including CAD, stroke, VTE and cancers.

A recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis involving 253,288 individuals of European ancestry by the GIANT consortium identified 697 height-associated variants which explain ~ 20% of the heritability of adult height. Here, using this set of genetic variants and the breadth and scale of the UK Biobank, we comprehensively evaluated the associations of adult height with 50 diseases in multiple body systems in the same population using both traditional epidemiological and genetic approaches. We additionally undertook pathway analysis of the height-associated genes to explore potential biological processes underlying the associations.
