## Question

CDC recommendations for screening patients for hepatitis c if they have a history of illicit drug use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about CDC recommendations for screening patients for hepatitis C if they have a history of illicit drug use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline universal screening recommendation and how it applies to all adults. Then, I should verify the specific risk-based guidance for people who inject drugs, including one-time versus periodic testing. Next, I will examine the testing algorithm and operational steps to ensure complete diagnosis. After that, I need to consider special situations like acute exposure, pregnancy, and correctional settings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation and note any nuances or exceptions that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the universal screening foundation. CDC recommends that all adults aged 18 years and older be screened at least once in their lifetime for hepatitis C, regardless of risk factors, with an exception only in settings where the HCV RNA prevalence is documented to be less than 0.1 percent, which is rare in the United States [^112TZ35q] [^116phdKw] [^1168FYhA].

> Wait, let me verify the specific guidance for people who inject drugs, because this is the crux of the question. CDC explicitly recommends one-time hepatitis C testing for all persons who have ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment, regardless of age or how long ago the injection occurred, and this remains in force alongside the universal adult screening recommendation [^112TZ35q] [^114jXRQq].

> Hold on, I should confirm the periodic testing cadence for ongoing risk. For persons with continued injection drug use or other ongoing risk factors, CDC recommends routine periodic testing as long as the risk persists; AASLD/IDSA guidance specifies at least annual testing for people who inject drugs, which aligns with CDC's principle of periodic testing while risk continues [^112TZ35q] [^114d2vXX] [^116phdKw].

> I need to check the testing algorithm to ensure we are not missing active infection. The recommended sequence is an initial anti-HCV antibody test with automatic reflex HCV RNA testing on the same specimen when the antibody is reactive; this single-visit, reflex approach reduces incomplete testing and improves linkage to care, which CDC emphasized in its 2023 operational update [^112F3aSH] [^115DX1Qv] [^116QvS7p].

> Let me consider special scenarios that change timing or modality. If there has been a recent exposure within the past 6 months or there is clinical suspicion of acute infection, HCV RNA testing should be performed because antibodies may not yet be detectable; in suspected acute infection, RNA can be detected within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure, whereas antibodies typically appear after 2 to 3 months [^112fLM8J] [^111JH1PH]. I should also confirm that pregnancy does not alter the need for testing; CDC recommends screening during each pregnancy, and people who inject drugs should still be tested periodically if risk persists [^112TZ35q] [^1168FYhA].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a correctional setting. I should double-check that. CDC notes that correctional settings often have high HCV prevalence, frequently exceeding the 0.1 percent threshold, so universal screening in prisons and jails is supported and expected to yield higher case finding than risk-based strategies alone [^117GUa6S].

> Next, I should review linkage-to-care elements that accompany a positive diagnosis, because screening without follow-up is insufficient. For patients diagnosed with active HCV infection, CDC recommends medical evaluation, hepatitis A and B vaccination if nonimmune, brief alcohol screening and intervention, and linkage to harm reduction services including syringe services and medications for opioid use disorder; importantly, active or recent drug use is not a contraindication to treatment with direct-acting antivirals, which achieve high cure rates [^116wFpPA] [^111P4mah] [^113Le8aD].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation so I do not miss anything. For any patient with a history of illicit drug use, particularly injection drug use with shared equipment, screen at least once with anti-HCV plus reflex HCV RNA, and if ongoing injection risk persists, repeat testing at least annually; ensure single-visit sample collection to complete diagnosis, and if there was recent exposure or acute suspicion, add HCV RNA testing now because serology may be falsely negative early. This approach integrates universal screening, risk-based periodic testing, and operational best practices for linkage to care [^112TZ35q] [^115DX1Qv] [^112fLM8J].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the universal recommendation might supersede the need to document ongoing risk for repeat testing; let me reconsider. Even under universal one-time screening, CDC retains the directive that persons with ongoing risk, including people who inject drugs, should undergo periodic testing as long as risk persists, so I should explicitly document ongoing injection risk and schedule annual testing in those cases rather than assuming a single lifetime screen suffices [^112TZ35q] [^1168FYhA].

---

The CDC recommends **one-time hepatitis C screening for all adults aged ≥ 18 years** [^112TZ35q] and **annual screening for people who inject drugs (PWID)** as long as injection risk continues [^114d2vXX] [^111P4mah]. This applies regardless of age, setting, or prior testing history, because PWID have high and ongoing risk of HCV acquisition and reinfection [^111n4U3j]. Screening should use **anti-HCV with reflex HCV RNA** [^112F3aSH] to confirm active infection and enable linkage to care and treatment [^115DX1Qv].

## CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening in patients with a history of illicit drug use

### Universal screening recommendation

One-time screening is recommended for **all adults aged ≥ 18 years** [^112TZ35q] at least once in their lifetime, regardless of risk factors, except in settings where HCV prevalence is < 0.1% [^1168FYhA]. This universal approach aims to identify unrecognized infections, including among PWID who may not disclose risk due to stigma [^117NmSk9].

---

### Risk-based screening for people who inject drugs (PWID)

PWID are a **high-risk group** [^112Ww8Kg] for HCV infection due to shared needles, syringes, and other drug paraphernalia [^112TZ35q]. Accordingly, CDC recommends:

- **Annual screening**: PWID should be screened at least annually [^114d2vXX] as long as injection risk persists [^111P4mah].
- **Regardless of prior testing**: Annual screening is recommended even if previous tests were negative, given ongoing risk and reinfection potential [^111P4mah].
- **One-time screening for past PWID**: Individuals with a history of injection drug use who no longer inject should have at least one-time screening [^112TZ35q].

---

### Rationale for annual screening in PWID

Annual screening in PWID is justified by:

- **High prevalence and incidence**: HCV seroprevalence among PWID ranges from 18% to 88% [^111n4U3j], and IDU accounts for ~70% of new HCV infections [^111n4U3j].
- **Ongoing risk**: Continued injection risk leads to high rates of new infection and reinfection after treatment or spontaneous clearance [^111P4mah].
- **Public health impact**: Regular screening enables early detection, linkage to care, and treatment, reducing transmission and disease burden [^115DX1Qv].

---

### Recommended testing algorithm

CDC recommends a **two-step testing algorithm** [^112F3aSH]:

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Anti-HCV antibody test | Screen for past or current infection |
| 2 | HCV RNA PCR (reflex or separate) | Confirm active infection and guide treatment |

---

Reflex HCV RNA testing on the same specimen is preferred to reduce **loss to follow-up** and ensure timely diagnosis and linkage to care [^115DX1Qv] [^116QvS7p].

---

### Clinical implications and follow-up

Positive results require **linkage to care** for clinical evaluation, staging, and treatment planning [^116wFpPA]. Treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieves > 95% cure and is recommended for PWID, with active drug use not a contraindication [^113Le8aD] [^111P4mah]. Counseling on harm reduction — including syringe services, naloxone, and medications for opioid use disorder — is essential to reduce transmission and reinfection risk [^115Ct8Ha] [^111P4mah].

---

## Summary of CDC recommendations

- **Universal screening**: All adults aged ≥ 18 years should be screened at least once in their lifetime [^112TZ35q].
- **Annual screening for PWID**: PWID should be screened at least annually as long as injection risk persists [^114d2vXX] [^111P4mah].
- **Testing algorithm**: Use anti-HCV with reflex HCV RNA to confirm active infection [^112F3aSH] [^115DX1Qv].
- **Linkage to care**: Ensure timely evaluation, treatment, and harm-reduction services for those who test positive [^116wFpPA] [^115Ct8Ha].

---

The CDC recommends **one-time screening for all adults** and **annual screening for PWID** as long as injection risk continues, using anti-HCV with reflex HCV RNA to confirm active infection and enable linkage to care and treatment [^112TZ35q] [^114d2vXX] [^112F3aSH].

Introduction

Hepatitis C is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in the United States, and surveys conducted during 2013–2016 indicated an estimated 2.4 million persons (1.0%) in the nation were living with hepatitis C. Percutaneous exposure is the most efficient mode of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission, and injection drug use (IDU) is the primary risk factor for infection. National surveillance data revealed an increase in reported cases of acute HCV infection every year from 2009 through 2017. The highest rates of acute infection are among persons aged 20–39 years. As new HCV infections have increased among reproductive aged adults, rates of HCV infection nearly doubled during 2009–2014 among women with live births. In 2015, 0.38% of live births were delivered by mothers with hepatitis C.

This report augments (i.e. updates and summarizes) previous CDC recommendations for testing of hepatitis C among adults in the United States published in 1998 and 2012. The recommendations in this report do not replace or modify previous recommendations for hepatitis C testing that are based on known risk factors or clinical indications. Previously published recommendations for hepatitis C testing of persons with risk factors and alcohol use screening and intervention for persons identified as infected with HCV remain in effect. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of clinical and preventive services.

Patient Follow-up After Hepatitis C Testing

Providers and patients can discuss hepatitis C screening as part of a person's preventive health care. For persons identified with current HCV infection, CDC recommends that they receive appropriate care, including hepatitis C-directed clinical preventive services (e.g. screening and intervention for alcohol or drug use, hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, and medical monitoring of disease).

Recommendations are available to guide management of persons infected with HCV (Box 2). Persons infected with HCV can benefit from treatment, prevention, and other counseling messages.

BOX 2
Management of persons with HCV infection

Persons with negative anti-HCV test results should be informed of their test results and reassured that they are not infected, unless they were recently exposed to infection (e.g. recent IDU). Repeat testing should occur for persons with ongoing risk behaviors. Persons with negative anti-HCV and positive HCV RNA test results have recent HCV infection.
Persons with positive anti-HCV and negative HCV RNA test results should be informed that they do not have current HCV infection. Test results indicate either a resolved past infection or a false-positive anti-HCV test result. Additional testing might be warranted to determine the patient's status.
Persons with positive anti-HCV and positive HCV RNA test results should be informed that they have active HCV infection and would benefit from curative treatment. They will need further evaluation before treatment, medical care for possible liver disease, and ongoing medical monitoring. Persons with HCV infection should be provided information about treatment options, how to prevent transmission of HCV to others, and drug treatment, as appropriate. Persons with hepatitis C also should be informed about the resources available to them within their communities, including providers of medical evaluation, harm reduction, and social support. At the time when positive test results are communicated to patients, health care providers should evaluate the patient's level of alcohol and drug use and provide a brief alcohol or drug use intervention, if clinically indicated.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^113QALj6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8–12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945–1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012;61[No. RR-4]). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with two new recommendations: 1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥ 18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1% and 2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

### Who to test and screen… [^114jXRQq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

One-time testing CDC recommends one-time hepatitis C testing for people with recognized risk factors or exposures, including:

- People who currently or have previously injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment.
- People with human immunodeficiency virus.
- People with selected medical conditions, including people who have ever received maintenance hemodialysis and persons with persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels.
- Prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, including:
	- People who received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987.
	- People who received a transfusion of blood or blood components before July
1992.
	- People who received an organ transplant before July 1992.
	- People who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection.
- Health care, emergency medical, and public safety personnel after needle sticks, sharps, or mucosal exposures to HCV-positive blood.
- Infants born to people with known hepatitis C. Routine periodic testing CDC also recommends routine periodic testing for patients with ongoing risk factors, including:

- People who currently inject drugs and share needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment.
- People with selected medical conditions, including people who receive maintenance hemodialysis. * If HCV RNA testing is not feasible and person tested is not immunocompromised, do follow-up testing for HCV antibody to demonstrate seroconversion. If the patient tested is immunocompromised, consider testing for HCV RNA. † It is recommended before initiating antiviral therapy to retest for HCV RNA in a subsequent blood sample to confirm HCV RNA positivity.

§ If the patient is suspected of having HCV exposure within the past 6 months, or has clinical evidence of HCV disease, or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen, the clinician should follow up with the patient. What to do next CDC recommends that clinicians offer the following services to people who are diagnosed with HCV infection:

- Medical evaluation.
- Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination.
- Screening and brief intervention for alcohol consumption.
- HIV risk assessment and testing. Learn more about hepatitis C clinical care and treatment.

Hepatitis C Testing Strategy

The goal of hepatitis C screening is to identify persons who are currently infected with HCV. Hepatitis C testing should be initiated with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-HCV test. Persons who test anti-HCV positive are either currently infected or had past infection that has resolved naturally or with treatment. Immunocompetent persons without hepatitis C risks who test anti-HCV negative are not infected and require no further testing. Persons testing anti-HCV positive should have follow-up testing with an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA. NAT for HCV RNA detection determines viremia and current HCV infection. Persons who test anti-HCV positive but HCV RNA negative do not have current HCV infection. CDC encourages use of reflex HCV RNA testing, in which specimens testing anti-HCV positive undergo HCV RNA testing immediately and automatically in the laboratory, using the same sample from which the anti-HCV test was conducted. Hepatitis C testing should be provided on-site when feasible.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^1168FYhA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CDC recommends hepatitis C screening of all adults aged ≥ 18 years once in their lifetimes, and screening of all pregnant women (regardless of age) during each pregnancy. The recommendations include an exception for settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is demonstrated to be < 0.1%; however, few settings are known to exist with a hepatitis C prevalence below this threshold (2, 9). The recommendation for testing of persons with risk factors remains unchanged; those with ongoing risk factors should be tested regardless of age or setting prevalence, including continued periodic testing as long as risks persist. These recommendations can be used by health care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, delivery, and evaluation of clinical and preventive services.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^115DX1Qv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing guidance recommends a two-step testing sequence for diagnosis of HCV infection. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to achieve national HCV elimination goals. When an HCV antibody test is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete. Historically, approximately one third of patients have incomplete testing. This update clarifies that all sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection. This approach allows for automatic HCV RNA testing when an HCV antibody test is reactive to avoid incomplete testing. Use of strategies that require multiple visits to collect HCV testing samples should be discontinued. Automatic HCV RNA testing on all HCV antibody reactive samples will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112JAgKs]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease. HCV is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV. Cases of acute HCV infection have increased approximately 3.8-fold over the last decade because of increasing injection drug use and improved surveillance.

Objective

To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for HCV infection in adolescents and adults.

Population

This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults aged 18 to 79 years without known liver disease.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years has substantial net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years. (B recommendation).

Recommendations

The following recommendations for hepatitis C screening augment those issued by CDC in 2012. The recommendations issued by CDC in 1998 remain in effect. CDC recommends (Box 1):

BOX 1
Persons recommended for hepatitis C testing

Universal hepatitis C screening (new recommendations): Hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥ 18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA-positivity) is < 0.1% Hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA-positivity) is < 0.1%
One-time hepatitis C testing regardless of age or setting prevalence among persons with recognized conditions or exposures (existing recommendations): Persons with HIV Persons who ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago Persons with selected medical conditions, including persons who ever received maintenance hemodialysis and persons with persistently abnormal ALT levels Prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, including persons who received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987, persons who received a transfusion of blood or blood components before July 1992, persons who received an organ transplant before July 1992, and persons who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection Health care, emergency medical, and public safety personnel after needle sticks, sharps, or mucosal exposures to HCV-positive blood Children born to mothers with HCV infection
Routine periodic testing for persons with ongoing risk factors, while risk factors persist: Persons who inject drugs and share needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment Persons with selected medical conditions, including persons who ever received maintenance hemodialysis
Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks

Determining Prevalence

In the absence of existing data for hepatitis C prevalence, health care providers should initiate universal hepatitis C screening until they establish that the prevalence of HCV RNA positivity in their population is < 0.1%, at which point universal screening is no longer explicitly recommended but might occur at the provider's discretion. Hepatitis C screening can be conducted in a variety of settings or programs that serve populations at different risk and with varying hepatitis C prevalence. Regardless of the provider, organization, or program providing testing, health care providers should initiate universal screening for adults and pregnant women unless the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity prevalence) in their patients has been documented to be < 0.1%. There are statistical challenges with determining a "number needed to screen" to detect a relatively rare disease in lower-risk settings; therefore, providers and program directors are encouraged to consult their state or local health departments or CDC to determine a reasonable estimate of baseline prevalence in their setting or a methodology for determining how many persons they need to screen before confidently establishing that the prevalence is < 0.1%. As a general guide: as HCV RNA prevalence is predicated on first testing for anti-HCV, and according to the most current serologic data in the United States, approximately 59% of anti-HCV positive persons are HCV RNA positive, an estimated 507 randomly selected patients in a setting of any size would need to be tested using any of the available anti-HCV tests to detect an anti-HCV prevalence positivity of ≤ 0.17%, corresponding to an expected HCV RNA positivity prevalence of 0.1% with 95% confidence and 5% tolerance.

### Relationship of hepatitis C risk to hepatitis C test acceptance among adult patients participating in an ED hepatitis C screening programme [^1129hdVc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most frequently reported bloodborne infection in the USA and causes significant morbidity and mortality and profound financial burden every year. Incident HCV infections have increased annually in the USA since 2009. As of 2018, there were approximately 50 300 new HCV infections, resulting in an estimated 2.4 million people living with HCV in the USA. Recent increases in incident HCV infections among individuals aged 20–39 years old in the USA are particularly notable, given that this age group previously had not been included in HCV screening recommendations.

In April 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expanded its HCV screening recommendations to recommended that all US adults aged ≥ 18 years be HCV tested at least once in their lifetime, regardless of HCV risk, and that all pregnant women be tested during every pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. This expansion was a significant change from prior CDC recommendations that were based on age cohorts, notably screening advised for 'baby boomers' (born from 1945 to 1965), and for those with HCV risk factors. According to the CDC, people with HCV risk factors are those who have HIV/AIDS; currently or formerly injected drugs; received hemodialysis, underwent transfusions or organ transplants prior to 1992; had prior percutaneous injuries or mucosal exposures to HCV in the healthcare setting; or were children born to mothers infected with HCV.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116phdKw]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Screening frequency and pediatric scope — Annual HCV testing is recommended for all persons who inject drugs and for men with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection who have unprotected sex with men (IIa, C). People with an ongoing risk factor(s) for HCV infection remain vulnerable for as long as the behavior, exposure, condition, or circumstance persists, thereby warranting periodic repeat HCV testing, and there is a paucity of data addressing the optimal frequency of repeat testing, thereby leaving the periodicity to the clinician's discretion on a case-by-case basis. Because of these challenges, at least annual HCV testing is recommended. One-time, risk-based HCV screening is recommended for persons younger than 18 years old with current or past behaviors, exposures, or conditions or circumstances associated with an increased risk of HCV infection, and there is currently insufficient evidence to support universal HCV screening in the pediatric population.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111G8Gpy]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical summary — risk assessment, test accuracy, and screening intervals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) identify priority populations and timing. The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use, with approximately one-third of PWID aged 18 to 30 years infected with HCV and 70% to 90% of older PWID infected. Pregnant adults should be screened; from 2011 to 2014, 0.73% of pregnant women tested had an HCV infection, with a 68% increase in the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers, and approximately 1700 infected infants are born annually to 29 000 HCV-infected mothers. Screening with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection, and currently diagnostic evaluations are often performed with various noninvasive tests that have lower risk for harm than liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis stage or cirrhosis in persons who screen positive. Most adults need to be screened only once; persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, PWID) should be screened periodically, although there is limited information about the specific screening interval that should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection or how pregnancy changes the need for additional screening.

Clinical Question

What are the screening guidelines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults in the United States?

Bottom Line

Patients with a high risk of infection, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who use injection drugs, or who live in a household where someone is infected with HBV; men who have sex with men; or patients who come from countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection, should be screened.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^117NmSk9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of the limited effectiveness of risk-based hepatitis C testing, CDC considered strategies to increase the proportion of infected persons who are aware of their status and are linked to care. In 2012, CDC augmented its guidance to recommend one-time hepatitis C screening for persons born during 1945–1965 (birth cohort) without ascertainment of risk. With an anti-HCV positivity prevalence of 3.25%, persons born in the 1945–1965 birth year cohort accounted for approximately three fourths of chronic HCV infections among U.S. adults during 1999–2008. Approximately 45% of persons infected with HCV do not recall or report having specific risk factors. Included in the 2012 guidelines were recommendations for alcohol use screening and intervention for persons identified with HCV infection. This report expands hepatitis C screening to at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged > 18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%.

The 2012 CDC guidelines recommended that pregnant women be tested for hepatitis C only if they have known risk factors. However, in 2018, universal hepatitis C screening during pregnancy was recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and IDSA. This report expands hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%.

Existing strategies for hepatitis C testing have had limited success. The 2013–2016 surveys indicate only approximately 56% of persons with HCV infection reported having ever been told they had hepatitis C. Therefore, strengthened guidance for universal hepatitis C testing is warranted. Models to address barriers related to access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment are needed to ensure health care equity and the success of expanded hepatitis C screening. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it regardless of disclosure of risk because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113R9Nmq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Implementation of universal HCV screening — The Guidance Panel first recommended universal HCV screening for all adults aged ≥ 18 years in 2019, and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) subsequently recommended universal HCV screening for adults aged 18 to 79 years in March 2020. In April 2020, the CDC recommended HCV screening at least once in all adults aged ≥ 18 years and for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, except in settings where HCV prevalence is < 0.1%. The rationale includes cost-effectiveness, improved HCV case finding, shifting epidemiology with incident infections occurring primarily in young adults, and the availability of safe, cost-effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment; universal screening is a crucial and necessary component of any HCV elimination strategy.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112Ww8Kg]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology — US burden and trends: HCV is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, and infection is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV; the most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use. In the US, an estimated 4.1 million persons have past or current HCV infection, approximately 2.4 million have current infections, and the estimated prevalence of chronic HCV infection is approximately 1% (2013 to 2016). An estimated 44 700 new HCV infections occurred in 2017, and cases of acute HCV infection have increased approximately 3.8-fold over the last decade, with the most rapid increase in young adults aged 20 to 39 years who inject drugs; increases have occurred in both sexes but are more pronounced in men, with rates increased especially in American Indian/Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic white populations.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have collaboratively developed evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since 2013. A panel of clinicians and investigators with extensive infectious diseases or hepatology expertise specific to HCV infection periodically review evidence from the field and update existing recommendations or introduce new recommendations as evidence warrants. This update focuses on changes to the guidance since the previous 2020 published update, including ongoing emphasis on recommended universal screening; management recommendations for incomplete treatment adherence; expanded eligibility for simplified chronic HCV infection treatment in adults with minimal monitoring; updated treatment and retreatment recommendations for children as young as 3 years old; management and treatment recommendations in the transplantation setting; and screening, treatment, and management recommendations for unique and key populations.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^117GUa6S]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C prevalence in U.S. correctional settings is high because of high incarceration rates among persons who use drugs. Two recent systematic reviews estimated average anti-HCV positivity prevalence in correctional settings at 16.1% and 23%. Hepatitis C prevalence varies across individual correctional jurisdictions based on factors including underlying community prevalence, sentencing standards for drug-related offenses, and type of institution. These estimates exceed both the general population prevalence of 1.7% and the target threshold of ≥ 0.1% at which these guidelines recommend universal hepatitis C testing in other settings. Therefore, the well-documented prevalence of HCV infection in a variety of correctional jurisdictions supports the application of these guidelines to prisons and jails. Universal hepatitis C testing in correctional facilities can be expected to yield higher infection identification rates compared with the risk-based testing practices that many jurisdictions employ and to support broader hepatitis C elimination efforts.

Reporting

Cases of hepatitis C should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements for reporting acute, perinatal, and chronic HCV infection. Case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HCV infection have been published previously by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Recommendations of Other Organizations

Recommendations in this report for hepatitis C screening among certain groups differ somewhat from the recommendations of other organizations. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and AASLD and IDSA also make recommendations for hepatitis C testing.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1173dx2L]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical summary — screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adolescents and adults outlines who to screen, how to test, and follow‑up. For adults aged 18 to 79 years: Grade B; screen adults for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and this applies to all asymptomatic adults (including pregnant persons) aged 18 to 79 years without known liver disease. Implementation states to screen adults aged 18 to 79 years with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing; adults with a positive screening test result are usually followed up with a diagnostic evaluation using one of various noninvasive tests, and treatment typically consists of oral direct-acting antiviral regimens for 8 to 12 weeks. The USPSTF also suggests that clinicians consider screening persons younger than 18 years and older than 79 years who are at high risk for infection (eg, those with past or current injection drug use). For intervals, periodically screen persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, persons with past or current injection drug use), and there is limited evidence to determine how often to screen persons at increased risk.

### Hepatitis C: diagnosis and management [^111a3eT6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations and treatment guidelines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been updated. People at the greatest risk of HCV infection are those between 18 and 39 years of age and those who use injection drugs. Universal screening with an anti-HCV antibody test with follow-up reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing for positive results to confirm active disease is recommended at least once for all adults 18 years and older and during each pregnancy. Any person with ongoing risk factors should be screened periodically as long as the at-risk behavior persists. One-time screening is recommended for patients younger than 18 years with risk factors. For treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, a simplified treatment regimen consisting of eight weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir results in greater than 95% cure rates. Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing therapy is considered a virologic cure (i.e., sustained virologic response). A sustained virologic response is associated with lower all-cause mortality and improves hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations, cognitive function, physical health, work productivity, and quality of life. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, posttreatment surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices should include abdominal ultrasonography (with or without alpha fetoprotein) every six months and upper endoscopy every two to three years. In the absence of cirrhosis, no liver-related follow-up is recommended.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^117TBoTX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Although treatment is not considered curative, antiviral treatment, monitoring, and liver cancer surveillance can reduce morbidity and mortality. Effective vaccines to prevent hepatitis B are available. This report updates and expands CDC's previously published Recommendations for Identification and Public Health Management of Persons with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection (MMWR Recomm Rep 2008;57[No. RR-8]) regarding screening for HBV infection in the United States. New recommendations include hepatitis B screening using three laboratory tests at least once during a lifetime for adults aged ≥ 18 years. The report also expands risk-based testing recommendations to include the following populations, activities, exposures, or conditions associated with increased risk for HBV infection: persons incarcerated or formerly incarcerated in a jail, prison, or other detention setting; persons with a history of sexually transmitted infections or multiple sex partners; and persons with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. In addition, to provide increased access to testing, anyone who requests HBV testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

### Hepatitis C screening: getting it right [^116a8kG1]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hepatitis C is the most prevalent bloodborne viral disease in the United States and the deadliest. This year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) will update its 2004 hepatitis C guideline, which recommends against screening asymptomatic adults for hepatitis C. This guideline has hampered public health efforts to encourage screening and identify and refer infected persons for care by declaring that such interventions were not supported by the evidence. A draft revision of the guideline, released on November 26, 2012, concludes that testing persons born between 1945 and 1965 probably has at least a small net benefit, but stops short of definitively recommending that this cohort be screened. This article examines the Task Force's process for writing its guidelines. It recommends that the Task Force adopt a balanced approach to evaluating the benefits and harms of screening; use the preponderance of the evidence as a standard for evaluating interventions that target serious public health problems; be transparent about the value judgments that go into its decisions; consider the wide variation in disease prevalence in diverse patient populations; and recommend screening asymptomatic adults for hepatitis C.

Conclusion

By taking a broader view of the evidence, the Task Force can write new guidelines that will serve efforts to curb the hepatitis C epidemic, rather than frustrate them.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^1129B2UR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In their best practice advice, ACP and CDC recommend testing persons at increased risk for HBV infection with tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. The ACP best practice risk groups align with current testing recommendations except that ACP omits persons with a history of STIs or multiple sex partners (Box 4).

CDC screening guidelines were developed independently from the ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination. The 2018 ACIP recommendations also include recommendations for serologic testing. CDC's screening and testing guidelines cover all persons recommended for serologic testing per ACIP and expand beyond that list (Box 1). When considering prevaccination testing or testing for HBV infection, CDC recommends testing that follows a universal testing approach (Figure 2).

The work group did not evaluate clinical guidance for patients after screening. The most recent expert guidance to reduce the risk for liver damage is that patients with HBV infection should be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (if not already immune); screened for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis D virus (HDV); and assessed for alcohol risk factors, such as with the alcohol screening and brief intervention. Depending on the likely route of transmission, the patient might benefit from STI screening, drug treatment, or harm-reduction counseling. A full list of recommended steps for examination, education, laboratory, serology, and imaging is provided (Table 2).

Additional screening might be recommended for blood donors, newly arrived refugees, and persons initiating cytotoxic or immunosuppressive and additional testing might be recommended for patients on hemodialysis, health care personnel, perinatally exposed infants, and persons involved in exposure events who might warrant postexposure prophylaxis and postvaccination serologic testing. These recommendations are described elsewhere (,–). Providers should follow the most conservative approach when recommendations differ.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^116QvS7p]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Updated Operational Guidance

This update clarifies that operational strategy 1 should be discontinued; operational strategies 2, 3, or 4 should be used to diagnose current HCV infection. In settings where HCV antibody testing is performed using finger-stick blood (operational strategy 4), a separate sample should be collected at the same visit to ensure that HCV RNA testing is completed when the HCV antibody result is reactive. If an HCV antibody is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete; an HCV RNA test should be performed for all HCV antibody reactive samples to establish the diagnosis of current HCV infection. Sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection (operational strategies 2–4) are used to avoid incomplete HCV testing.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Screening for chronic hepatitis C: American College of Preventive Medicine practice policy statement [^112NvYiD]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C is an under-diagnosed and prevalent bloodborne illness, resulting in chronic cirrhosis in up to 25% of those infected. While the overall prevalence in the United States is 1.7%, high-risk populations may have up to 80% prevalence. The mechanism of transmission is well understood, but effective preventive measures are hampered by economic, social, and political factors. Antiviral treatment is expensive, and efficacy ranges from 40% to 85%. The value of screening high-risk populations has been demonstrated, and should be expanded; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for adults.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection: a review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114jmbLv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common bloodborne pathogen in the United States and is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality, but it is unclear whether screening to identify asymptomatic infected persons is appropriate.

Purpose

To synthesize the evidence on risks and benefits of screening for HCV infection.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (through February 2003), Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (2002, Issue 2), reference lists, and experts.

Study Selection

Controlled studies of screening and antiviral therapy and observational studies on other interventions, risk factors, accuracy of antibody testing, work-up, harms of biopsy, and long-term outcomes.

Data Extraction

Using preset criteria, the authors assessed the quality of included studies and abstracted information about settings, patients, interventions, and outcomes.

Data Synthesis

There are no published trials of screening for HCV infection. Approximately 2% of U.S. adults have HCV antibodies, with the majority having chronic infection. Risk factor assessment could identify adults at substantially higher risk. Antiviral treatment can result in a sustained virologic response rate of 54% to 56%, but no trials have been done specifically in asymptomatic patients likely to be identified by screening. Data are insufficient to determine whether treatment improves long-term outcomes. There are no data to estimate the benefit from counseling or immunizations. Although risks of biopsy and treatment appear minimal or self-limited, data on other adverse effects of screening, such as labeling or anxiety, are sparse.

Conclusions

Antiviral treatment can successfully eradicate HCV, but data on long-term outcomes in populations likely to be identified by screening are lacking. Although the yield from targeted screening, particularly in intravenous drug users, would be substantially higher than in the general population, data are inadequate to accurately weigh the overall benefits and risks of screening in otherwise healthy asymptomatic adults.

Screening Strategies for HCV

In the United States, mortality associated with hepatitis C is on the rise and currently exceeds that for HIV. On the basis of survey data from 1999 to 2002, it has been estimated that 3.2 (2.7–3.9) million persons in the United States have chronic HCV infection. The strongest risk of HCV infection is a history of injection drug use. Of persons with chronic infection, 74% were born during the years 1945 through 1965.

In 1998, CDC recommended a risk-based approach to screening, with routine HCV testing for persons with risk factors including injection drug use, having received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987, being on chronic haemodialysis, having persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels, being a recipient of donated blood from a person who tested positive for HCV, or having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992; in 1999, CDC recommended HCV testing for persons with HIV. The 2009 guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)and the 2006 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterologyalso recommend screening in high-risk patients. However, risk-based screening strategies can be limited either by clinician reluctance to ask about risk factors or by patient unawareness or reluctance to disclose risk behaviours. As a result, use of risk-based strategies alone has resulted in a large proportion of infected persons remaining undiagnosed; in the United States, various estimates indicate that 45–85% of persons with HCV are unaware of their infection status–. To augment risk-based screening, in 2012 CDC published a recommendation for one-time testing without prior ascertainment of HCV risk for persons born during 1945–1965. This birth-cohort approach was designed to both target persons with the highest prevalence of HCV infection and remove any behavioural stigma from screening. In the state of New York, legislation requiring all patients born within the birth-cohort period to be offered hepatitis C screening when they visit healthcare providers has passed the legislature and is awaiting the governor's approval.

Recommendations of others — hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening policies: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention draft screening guideline recommends screening for HCV at least once in a lifetime for all adults 18 years and older, except in settings where the prevalence is less than 0.1%, and states that all pregnant persons should be screened for HCV during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%. It further states that all persons with risk factors should be tested for HCV, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering HCV screening to pregnant persons with risk factors. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 1-time routine, opt-out HCV screening for persons 18 years and older and 1-time testing for all persons younger than 18 years at increased risk of HCV exposure, and also recommends periodic testing for persons with an increased risk of HCV exposure and annual HCV testing for all PWID and for HIV-infected men who have unprotected sex with men.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113hGDiX]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening — adults aged 18 to 79 y emphasizes that there is adequate evidence for 1-time testing in all adults with periodic testing for those at continued risk, while evidence on timing of repeat testing is inadequate; treatment benefits are supported by convincing evidence that newer direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens result in sustained virologic response (SVR) in a very high proportion (> 95%) of adults aged 18 to 79 y with adequate evidence of SVR in adolescents, although direct evidence on health outcomes is inadequate; potential harms of screening include anxiety, patient labeling, and stigmatization, but current DAA regimens have fewer harms than older interferon-containing regimens with shorter treatment duration at 8 to 12 weeks and low rates of serious adverse effects and withdrawal; overall, given screening accuracy and effective interventions, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 y has substantial net benefit.

### Hepatitis C virus testing of persons born during 1945–1965: recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention [^1171Bm89]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a group of governmental and private sector partners developed these evidence-based recommendations to increase the proportion of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected persons who know their status and are linked to appropriate care and treatment. The recommendations also address brief alcohol screening, as alcohol accelerates progression of liver disease among HCV-infected individuals. These recommendations augment CDC's 1998 and 1999 recommendations based on risk and medical indications and are not meant to replace those recommendations.

Methods

These recommendations are based on systematic reviews of evidence published from 1995 through February 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during 1945–1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945–1965 [^116StuwV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Many of the 2.7–3.9 million persons living with HCV infection are unaware they are infected and do not receive care (e.g., education, counseling, and medical monitoring) and treatment. CDC estimates that although persons born during 1945–1965 comprise an estimated 27% of the population, they account for approximately three fourths of all HCV infections in the United States, 73% of HCV-associated mortality, and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and other HCV-related liver disease. With the advent of new therapies that can halt disease progression and provide a virologic cure (i.e., sustained viral clearance following completion of treatment) in most persons, targeted testing and linkage to care for infected persons in this birth cohort is expected to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. CDC is augmenting previous recommendations for HCV testing (CDC. Recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-19]) to recommend one-time testing without prior ascertainment of HCV risk for persons born during 1945–1965, a population with a disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Persons identified as having HCV infection should receive a brief screening for alcohol use and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care for HCV infection and related conditions. These recommendations do not replace previous guidelines for HCV testing that are based on known risk factors and clinical indications. Rather, they define an additional target population for testing: persons born during 1945–1965. CDC developed these recommendations with the assistance of a work group representing diverse expertise and perspectives. The recommendations are informed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, an approach that provides guidance and tools to define the research questions, conduct the systematic review, assess the overall quality of the evidence, and determine strength of the recommendations. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health-care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services. These recommendations will be reviewed every 5 years and updated to include advances in the published evidence.

### Opportunities for enhanced prevention and control of hepatitis C through improved screening and testing efforts [^111FgZnv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

An estimated 2.4 million people in the United States are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated hepatitis C screening recommendations to test adults aged ≥ 18 years at least once in a lifetime and pregnant persons during each pregnancy. For those with ongoing exposure to HCV, periodic testing is recommended. The recommended testing sequence is to obtain an HCV antibody test and, when positive, perform an HCV RNA test. Examination of HCV care cascades has found that incomplete HCV testing occurs when a separate visit is required to obtain the HCV RNA test. Hepatitis C core antigen testing has been shown to be a useful tool for diagnosing current HCV infection in some settings. Hepatitis C testing that is completed, accurate, and efficient is necessary to achieve hepatitis C elimination goals.

Diagnosis and Hepatitis C Elimination

In one report, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine explored the feasibility of hepatitis C elimination and concluded that hepatitis C could be eliminated as a public health problem in the United States, but that substantial obstacles exist. In another report, specific actions were recommended to achieve elimination considering information, interventions, service delivery, financing, and research. These reports were the culmination of decades of progress in the development of HCV infection diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

In 1990, serologic tests to detect immunoglobulin G anti-HCV by enzyme immunoassay were licensed and became commercially available in the United States, and U.S. blood banks voluntarily began testing donations for anti-HCV. In 1991, U.S. Public Health Service issued interagency guidelines addressing hepatitis C screening of blood, organs, and tissues. These guidelines recommended hepatitis C testing for all donations of whole blood and components for transfusion, as well as testing serum/plasma from donors of organs, tissues, or semen intended for human use.

In 1998, CDC expanded the interagency guidelines to provide recommendations for preventing transmission of HCV; identifying, counseling, and testing persons at risk for hepatitis C; and providing appropriate medical evaluation and management of persons with hepatitis C. The guidelines recommended testing on the basis of risk factors for HCV infection for persons who ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago and do not consider themselves as drug users; with selected medical conditions, including those who received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987; who were ever on chronic hemodialysis (maintenance hemodialysis); with persistently abnormal ALT levels; who were prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, including those who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection; who received a transfusion of blood or blood components before July 1992, or who received an organ transplant before July 1992; and with a recognized exposure, including health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after a needlestick injury, sharps injury, or mucosal exposure to blood infected with hepatitis C or children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C. In 1999, the U.S. Public Health Service and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommended hepatitis C testing for persons with HIV.

### Viral hepatitis Among people who use or inject drugs… [^117VZwhK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Risks Certain populations, including people who use or inject drugs, have an increased risk for contracting viral hepatitis. Injection drug use and hepatitis A Hepatitis A is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. While hepatitis A can affect anyone, certain groups are at greater risk for infection. Recent person-to-person transmission of hepatitis A has occurred across the country, and frequently among PWUD. In some cases, people can experience severe complications, hospitalization, and even death. CDC recommends that people who use or inject drugs be vaccinated against hepatitis A. for hepatitis B screening and testing in 2023 that are complementary to the 2022 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccine recommendations for hepatitis B. The updated recommendations include hepatitis B screening for all adults once in their lifetime and hepatitis B vaccination for all adults aged 19–59 years. Learn more about hepatitis B clinical screening and testing.

Injection drug use and hepatitis C Hepatitis C virus is also a bloodborne pathogen. The number of acute hepatitis C cases has doubled since 2015. Among risk behaviors and exposures identified for reported cases of acute HCV infection in 2023, injection drug use was most commonly reported. CDC recommends one-time screening for all adults, testing for anyone who has ever injected drugs, regardless of age, and periodic testing if risk persists. Learn more about hepatitis C clinical screening and testing.
- Access to sterile syringes and disposal of used injection equipment.
- Testing and vaccination for infectious diseases.
- Linkage to treatment for infectious diseases.
- Linkage to treatment for substance use disorder. SSPs are associated with an estimated 50% reduction in HIV and HCV incidence.

Nearly 30 years of research show that comprehensive SSPs are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV, and other infections.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116GQicJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for New Recommendations

Chronic HBV infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality but is detectable before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests. Routine monitoring and treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality, supporting the importance of early detection of HBV infection. In addition, although not quantifiable, management of chronic infection through prevention efforts can prevent further transmission to others. These recommendations consider a simpler and less stigmatizing implementation strategy than previous risk-based HBV screening recommendations. The recommendations also provide guidance that is complementary to the 2022 ACIP recommendations to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years against HBV infection by providing a means to establish immunity or any history of infection or the need for vaccination to protect from future infection. Specific rationales for recommendations are as follows:

Recommendations of others — hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening populations: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Physicians, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend screening for HBV infection in high-risk persons including all persons born in countries with an HBsAg prevalence of 2% or greater; US-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with an HBsAg prevalence of 8% or greater; persons who inject drugs; men who have sex with men; persons with HIV infection; persons with hepatitis C virus infection; inmates of correctional facilities; and household contacts and sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons. Both the CDC and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommend screening patients with conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy, those receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, persons with elevated ALT levels of unknown etiology, and developmentally disabled persons and staff in residential facilities; the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommends screening persons with multiple sexual partners or a history of sexually transmitted infections; and the American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on HBV screening.

### Risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection at a large urban emergency department [^116ayf4C]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2020, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines recommending HCV screening in all adults 18years and older. In the current study, we aimed to identify risk factors for HCV infection in an ED population. We performed a retrospective analysis of ED patients ≥ 18years who were screened for HCV between 28 November 2018, and 27 November 2019, at a single urban, quaternary referral academic hospital. An HCV-antibody immunoassay (HCV-Ab) was used for screening; positive results were confirmed by measuring HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). The outcome of interest was the number of new HCV diagnoses (presence of viremia by HCV RNA testing). Multiple logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with a new HCV diagnosis. 16,722 adult patients were screened for HCV (mean age: 46 ± 15years; 51% female). HCV seroprevalence was 5%. Independent risk factors for HCV included increasing age [10-year aOR 1.26 (95% CI 1.23, 1.30)], male sex [aOR 1.25 (95% CI 1.03, 1.51)], undomiciled housing status [aOR 2.8 (95% CI 2.3, 3.5)], history of tobacco use [aOR 3.0 (95% CI 2.3, 3.9)], history of illicit drug use [aOR 3.6 (95% CI 2.9, 4.5)], Medicaid insurance status [aOR 4.0 (95% CI 2.9, 5.5)] and Medicare insurance status [aOR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1, 2.2)]. The ED services a high-risk population with regards to HCV infection. These data support universal screening of ED patients for HCV. Risk factor profiles could improve targeted screening at institutions without universal testing protocols.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) not living with HIV — screening and prevention are specified: "acute HCV infections have also been reported among MSM not living with HIV who present for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP)". Therefore, "HCV testing at HIV PrEP initiation and at least annually thereafter (while on PrEP) is recommended for MSM not living with HIV". Additionally, "All MSM should be counseled about the risk of sexual HCV transmission with high-risk sexual and drug use practices and educated about measures to prevent HCV infection or transmission". During and after treatment, "Antiviral treatment for HCV-infected MSM should be coupled with ongoing counseling about the risk of HCV reinfection and education about methods to reduce HCV reinfection risk after cure", and "At least annual (and risk-based, if indicated) HCV RNA testing is recommended for all high-risk sexually active MSM after successful treatment or spontaneous clearance of HCV infection".

### Down-classification of hepatitis C virus diagnostics: implications for screening and diagnosis [^1176v9Pd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2020, the US Preventive Services Taskforce recommended screening of all adults aged 18–70 years and acknowledged the need to shift away from risk-based screening if unaware persons are to be successfully identified. The currently recommend diagnostic algorithm is testing for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) followed by HCV RNA testing among those who are anti-HCV positive. Societal guidelines highlight the need for repeat screening in certain populations, such as with every pregnancy, persons who use drugs, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected men who have unprotected sex with men. Other settings that may warrant special attention for screening due to high prevalence and potential for reinfection include those in the judicial system and those unsheltered. While screening in clinics and hospitals using traditional laboratory-based screening tests will be useful for screening for most persons who are insured, alternative approaches to screening in nontraditional settings is needed to reach those at risk but who intersect less with healthcare systems. For these settings, POC testing offers significant benefits. With the view to enhancing progress in diagnosis, the first step in the HCV care cascade and entry point for persons infected with HCV to get access to curative therapy, diagnostics will need to be accessible, acceptable, and inexpensive. With increasing emphasis on "test and treat" models of care for HCV, the need for POC testing using rapid diagnostic tests has never been greater.

### The meaning of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade I recommendation: screening for hepatitis C virus infection [^116CQgLB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) formulates evidence-based recommendations for clinical preventive services. These recommendations are communicated by letter grades that reflect the quality of evidence and the magnitude of net health benefit expected from delivering the preventive service. When the USPSTF finds insufficient evidence to determine the balance of health benefits or harms of delivering a preventive service, because of a lack of studies, poor-quality studies, or good-quality studies with conflicting results, the USPSTF assigns the service an I letter grade. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for hepatitis C virus infection in high-risk individuals (I letter grade). This recommendation reflects the need for further research that would provide adequate evidence to assess the net health benefit for persons screened for hepatitis C virus infection.

### Improving adherence to hepatitis C screening guidelines [^114u7ZC2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

HCV is an RNA virus which can cause chronic infection leading to hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure requiring transplantation — yet the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic following acute infection. The CDC estimates that 2.7–3.9 million Americans are living with HCV infection, with 45%–85% unaware they were ever infected. Traditionally, HCV screening targeted only those patients with documented risk factors for HCV infection, yet data from the National Hepatitis Screening Survey show that targeted screening misses 31%–47% of cases of HCV in the USA. Screening has become particularly important with the advent of highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents, which can prevent development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or need for transplantation.

Epidemiologists identified a particular birth cohort, those born between 1945 and 1965, which carries the majority of the HCV burden in the USA with 67% of all cases. As a result, both the CDC and USPSTF recommend HCV screening for all those born between 1945 and 1965, in addition to those at increased risk based on traditional risk factors. Screening consists of an initial HCV antibody test followed by confirmatory PCR if positive. The release of the updated CDC and USPSTF guidelines on HCV screening presented an opportunity to evaluate the adoption of new guidelines within an academic primary care clinic.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020 [^113RbZ5p]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

To inform these recommendations, comprehensive systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, analyzed, and assessed in two stages. These reviews examined the availability of evidence regarding HCV infection prevalence and the health benefits and harms associated with one-time hepatitis C screening for persons unaware of their status.

CDC determined that the new recommendations constituted scientific information that will have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies and private sector decisions. Therefore, the Information Quality Act required peer review by specialists in the field who were not involved in the development of these recommendations. CDC solicited nominations for reviewers from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), IDSA, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Six clinicians with expertise in hepatology, gastroenterology, internal medicine, infectious diseases and/or obstetrics and gynecology provided structured peer reviews. In addition, feedback from the public was solicited through a Federal Register notice released on October 28, 2019, announcing the availability of the draft recommendations for public comment through December 27, 2019. CDC received 69 public comments on the draft document from academia, professional organizations, industry, and the public. Many of the comments from both peer reviewers and the public were in support of the recommendations. For those comments that proposed changes, the majority related to screening for hepatitis C in every pregnancy or removing the prevalence threshold for universal screening. Feedback attained during both the peer review process and the public comment period was reviewed by CDC. Ultimately, no changes to the recommendations were made; however, additional references and justification for the recommendation to screen during every pregnancy and maintaining the prevalence threshold were added to the document.

To facilitate the systematic review of the evidence, two research questions were formulated to guide the development of the recommendations:

Does universal screening for hepatitis C virus infection among adults aged ≥ 18 years, compared with risk-based screening, reduce morbidity and mortality?
Does universal screening for hepatitis C virus infection among pregnant women, compared with risk-based screening, reduce morbidity and mortality among mothers and their children?

An analytic framework describing the chain of indirect evidence was developed:

How would universal screening for hepatitis C affect the number (and composition) of persons who screen positive for HCV infection?
How many additional persons would be linked to care?
Do desirable treatment effects outweigh undesirable effects?

Key questions (KQ) were formulated for each link of the chain (Supplementary Table 1,):

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112F9HSp]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Update of USPSTF hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening recommendation — age expansion and rationale notes that the 2013 USPSTF recommendation recommended screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk and in adults born between 1945 and 1965 (B recommendation), and the new USPSTF recommendation expands the ages for screening to all adults from 18 to 79 years; since 2013, the prevalence of HCV infection has increased in younger persons aged 20 to 39 years, prevalence in older adults born between 1945 and 1965 remains relatively high, and clinical trials of DAA treatment included adults in their early 80s, while epidemiologic data in adolescents younger than 18 years are limited; as a result, the USPSTF concluded that broadening the age for HCV screening will identify infected patients earlier who could benefit from effective treatment before complications develop.

### Potential consequences of healthcare recommendations: a focus on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^1145qhCF]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Healthcare guidelines and recommendations have broad-reaching impact. They serve as the evidence to enforce medical testing by establishing a bar for standard of care through their intrinsic credibility but also by affecting reimbursement. In this article, we discuss the various organizations in the United States that develop healthcare policy and guidelines. We focus on the recent recommendations for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening put forward by these agencies and the potential effect of these documents. Additional discussion is provided on the recent draft HCV screening recommendations provided by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), comparison of these to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and professional societies' response to these.

Conclusion

As written, the USPSTF recommendations may reduce physician adoption of HCV screening in the 1945–1965 birth cohort as advocated by the CDC. Conflicting guidelines may further confuse providers and the public. This will ultimately hinder recognition of chronic HCV in an otherwise easily identifiable, high prevalence group, allowing progression of disease at a time when therapeutic advances make cure a realistic opportunity for many.

### Drug misuse and hepatitis C virus infection profiles for three generations of patients being monitored for prescription drug adherence [^1128yqNW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There are 2 related epidemics in the United States: injection drug use and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is the most common blood-borne infection in the country; approximately 2.9 to 3.7 million people currently have chronic HCV infection. HCV was listed as a contributing cause of death in over 19,000 people in the United States in 2014, and has outnumbered HIV as a cause of death since 2007. The number of opioid-related deaths in the United States has tripled since 2000, moving in parallel with increased opioid prescribing. Injection drug use is the primary risk factor for HCV infection. Recent studies have shown associations between the injection of prescription opioids and a number of adverse health outcomes, including HCV infection. Progression from prescription opioid misuse to injection drug use has been noted, and those who make this transition have elevated rates of HCV infection.

With early infection, patients may be asymptomatic or describe flu-like symptoms including nausea and fatigue — symptoms that do not necessarily prompt clinicians to test for HCV. Approximately 75% to 85% of newly acquired HCV cases develop into chronic HCV, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Advances in treatment include direct-acting antiviral drugs that are highly effective at treating HCV, but even after treatment of the virus there are risks of hepatocellular carcinoma that persist in patients with higher fibrosis scores, making screening for HCV at earlier stages critical to improved health outcomes.

In 2012, CDC recommended HCV screening for all persons born from 1945 through 1965 (baby boomers). A recent study suggested that the HCV epidemic peaked from 1940 through 1965 with reused medical syringes within hospitals largely to blame, a common practice before disposable syringes became standard. The research concluded that anyone born particularly from 1945 through 1964 should be tested for HCV, even with a lack of risk factors. The CDC and US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have also provided guidance on management of patients with infections associated with illicit drug use. This guideline stressed the importance of HCV screening services and also noted that, "Screening for illicit use of drugs… and screening for misuse of prescription drugs, can be useful adjuncts to screening for infectious diseases".

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113172aj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in asymptomatic adults.

Methods

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality commissioned 2 systematic reviews on screening for and treatment of HCV infection in asymptomatic adults, focusing on evidence gaps identified in the previous USPSTF recommendation and new studies published since 2004. The evidence on screening for HCV in pregnant women was also considered.

Population

This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults without known liver disease or functional abnormalities.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk for infection. The USPSTF also recommends offering 1-time screening for HCV infection to adults born between 1945 and 1965. (B recommendation).

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

Testing of source patients after potential exposure of health care personnel to hepatitis C virus — CDC guidance, United States, 2020*

Abbreviations: AASLD-IDSA = American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America; HCP = health care personnel; HCV = hepatitis C virus; NAT = nucleic acid test.

* Testing of the source patient should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hour) after exposure. Testing may follow option A (preferred), which is testing with a NAT for HCV RNA, or option B, which is testing for anti-HCV with reflex to a NAT for HCV RNA if positive. If the source patient is known or suspected to have recent behaviors that increase risk for HCV acquisition (e.g. injection drug use within the previous 4 months) or if risk cannot be reliably assessed, initial testing of the source patient should include a NAT for HCV RNA. A source patient found to be positive for HCV RNA should be referred to care. Follow-up testing of HCP is recommended if the source patient is HCV RNA positive, anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA status unknown, or cannot be tested. Persons with detectable HCV RNA at any point should be referred to care consistent with current AASLD-IDSA guidelines for evaluation and treatment of all persons with acute or chronic HCV infection. Guidance for hepatitis C treatment is evolving with emerging data on treatment with direct-acting antivirals.

Chronic hepatitis C — alcohol counseling and treatment considerations: Prevention of further liver damage is crucial, and there is no known safe level of alcohol use for patients with chronic hepatitis C; patients with chronic hepatitis C, especially those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, should be advised to abstain from alcohol use, persons suffering from alcohol use disorder require treatment for this condition with consideration of referral to an addiction specialist, and ongoing alcohol use, however, is not a contraindication to antiviral therapy as data indicate that ongoing alcohol use does not affect therapeutic outcomes with DAA regimens among treatment-adherent patients.

People who inject drugs (PWID) — testing, treatment access, and follow-up are specified as follows: "Annual HCV testing is recommended for PWID with ongoing IDU regardless of either no prior testing or past negative testing". "Substance use disorder treatment programs and needle/syringe exchange programs should offer routine, opt-out HCV antibody testing with confirmatory HCV RNA testing and linkage to care for those determined to be HCV-infected". PWID with HCV infection "should be counseled about measures to reduce the risk of transmission to others and offered linkage to harm reduction services, including intranasal naloxone, needle/syringe service programs, medications for opioid use disorder, and other substance use disorder treatment programs". Evidence indicates that treatment outcomes are high: studies "demonstrate SVR12 rates approaching 95%". The panel's stance is explicit: "active or recent drug use or concern for reinfection is not a contraindication to HCV treatment". After spontaneous clearance or cure, "At least annual HCV RNA testing is recommended for PWID with recent IDU after they have spontaneously cleared HCV infection or have been successfully treated".

Persons with HCV Infection or a Past HCV Infection

The systematic review found 8,295 articles for review; after title review, 1,233 potentially relevant articles remained. After review of articles meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles were included (Supplementary Table 12). In 10 U.S. studies, the prevalence of current HBV infection (on the basis of HBsAg positivity, HBV DNA positivity, or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes) among persons with HCV infection ranged from 0.2% to 5.8% (median = 1.2%). Among persons with HCV infection, the prevalence of ever being exposed to HBV ranged from 24.7% to 62.6% (median = 43.0%); this finding was based on anti-HBc positivity, regardless of other HBV test results. Isolated anti-HBc positivity ranged from 36.9% to 53.8% (median = 39.5%) among patients with HCV infection.

HBV Reactivation During Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy for HCV

FDA requires a boxed warning about the risk for HBV reactivation to be added to drug labels of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication for HCV infection. The boxed warning directs health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV infection in all patients receiving DAA treatment.

In a published systematic review of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy among patients with HCV infection, the overall risk for HBV reactivation was 24% (95% CI = 19%–30%) in patients with untreated chronic HBV infection and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8%–2.4%) in patients with resolved HBV infection. The risk for HBV reactivation–related hepatitis (i.e. symptomatic) was 9% (95% CI = 5%–16%) in patients with chronic HBV infection; HBV reactivation–related hepatitis did not occur in patients with resolved infection. Three of 1,621 patients with chronic HBV infection had a major clinical event related to the reactivation (liver decompensation or failure), but there were no deaths.

Four studies were published after the 2018 systematic review. In two national cohort studies of U.S. veterans with chronic HCV infection prescribed DAA therapy, HBV reactivation was rare (< 0.1%) and more frequent among patients who were HBsAg positive. Similarly, two other U.S.-based cohort studies of patients with HCV coinfected with HBV did not detect any cases of DAA-associated HBV reactivation.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115oPZKS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Screening for substance use disorders (SUDs) in people with HIV — screening should be integrated into routine care with brief questions and alcohol cautions: Screening for SUDs should be incorporated into the routine clinical care of all people with HIV. The following questions can be used to screen for drug or alcohol use: "How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?" and "How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day?" (X is five for men and four for women). Individuals with liver disease, including active HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection, should not consume alcohol. Currently, there are not enough data to determine how often people with HIV should be screened for SUDs; however, given the potential negative impact that SUDs may have on people with HIV, it is advisable to ask these questions during every clinical visit.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance 2023 update — key targets and changes — notes the World Health Organization goal of elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 and lists specific HCV elimination targets that include a 90% reduction in incidence and prevalence, treatment of 80% of eligible persons with chronic infection, a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths, and universal access to key prevention and treatment services. Under the umbrella of the HCV guidance, the AASLD-IDSA HCV Guidance Panel also issues regular, periodic published updates to review new or updated data and recommendations. Major changes in the HCV guidance since the previous 2020 publication featured in this update include an ongoing emphasis on universal HCV screening; new recommendations that address the management of incomplete treatment adherence; updated recommendations regarding simplified treatment with minimal monitoring and expanded eligibility; management and treatment recommendations for solid organ transplant recipients; newly expanded treatment and retreatment recommendations for children and adolescents; and screening, management, and treatment recommendations for unique and key populations.

People who inject drugs (PWID) — epidemiology and treatment-as-prevention impact: Injection drug use (IDU) is the most common risk factor for HCV infection in North America and Europe, with HCV seroprevalence among PWID ranging from 18% to 88%, and IDU accounting for approximately 70% of new HCV infections. After implementation of unrestricted access to DAA therapy in 2016 in Australia, the proportion of PWID with active HCV who were treated increased from 3% to 47%, while the proportion with HCV viremia declined from 44% to 17%.

### Drug misuse and hepatitis C virus infection profiles for three generations of patients being monitored for prescription drug adherence [^113ZEpHY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A major strength of this study is the large, geographically diverse cohort that enabled us to stratify analyses by generation and show differing patterns of inconsistent drug test results between baby boomers and populations born before and after the baby boomers. We were also able to show differences in the drug classes most often associated with inconsistent drug test results between these generations, highlighting troubling patterns of inconsistency and potentially dangerous drug interaction implications for prescribers. Use of drug testing data obtained by mass spectrometry allowed analysis of demonstrated drug use, as opposed to prescription information or survey results. This provides a more accurate view as to actual drugs used, including prescribed, non-prescribed, and illicit.

This study also has limitations. This retrospective analysis included only patients screened for HCV infection, which introduced a selection bias, as evidenced by the approximately 5 times higher rate of HCV positivity in this population compared to Quest Diagnostics testing in the national population. It is possible that in some cases patients in our study were tested for drugs because their healthcare providers suspected a higher probability of misuse, while the index of suspicion was lower for others who were not tested. However, with the 2016 CDC guideline recommending all patients prescribed opioids be tested before and periodically during treatment, this cohort may be representative of patients whose healthcare providers are already following best practice guidelines. In addition, history of injection drug use may be the reason a person was tested for HCV; this could potentially bias certain drug class analyses. Different screening recommendations for various generations could also create different types of selection biases, possibly influencing the generational differences observed in this study. We excluded patients in addiction treatment because their results are markedly different from those of other patients, and would skew many results of the study in a significant way. While we believe this is a strength of the study in that it makes the results more generalizable to the US patient population, it does not allow for analysis of the addiction treatment population, which may be of particular interest for this subject matter. In the logistic regression models for drug use classes the number of tests per patient was not controlled for. The cohort of pre-baby boomers, born before 1945, was smaller (n = 759) than the other 2 generational cohorts. More than half of the prescription drug monitoring tests came from 2 HHS regions (3 and 4), and over a third of patients came from HHS region 4. These regions have been among the regions most affected by the rising drug epidemic in the United States and the related epidemic of HCV infection.

Discussion

Historically, CDC has focused hepatitis C screening efforts among persons born during 1945–1965 and testing among those with identified risk factors regardless of age. Concurrent with the nation's opioid crisis, however, rapid increases in acute HCV infections among young adults, including reproductive-aged persons, have put multiple U.S. generations at risk for chronic HCV infection. In today's issue of MMWR Recommendations and Reports, CDC recommends a universal testing strategy for hepatitis C among adults, including pregnant women.

CDC first began publishing recommendations for hepatitis C screening in 1991, when the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) issued guidelines recommending hepatitis C testing of all blood and organ donations intended for human use. In 1998, CDC expanded the hepatitis C interagency testing guidelines to include a recommendation for testing persons at high risk. These persons were defined as those who had ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment; received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987; had ever been on maintenance hemodialysis; had persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels; received blood transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992; had a recognized exposure (e.g. a needlestick or other sharps injury); or were born to a mother infected with HCV. In 1999, USPHS added persons with human immunodeficiency virus to the groups recommended for testing. In 2012, because of concern regarding limited effectiveness of risk-based hepatitis C testing and a high prevalence of disease among persons born during 1945–1965, CDC augmented the risk-based testing guidelines with a recommendation for a one-time testing of all baby boomers, even in the absence of a known risk factor.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^114NzJn3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Universal screening of adults for HBV infection is cost-effective compared with risk-based screening and averts liver disease and death. Although a curative treatment is not yet available, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic HBV infections reduces the risk for cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. Risk-based testing alone has not identified most persons living with chronic HBV infection and is inefficient for providers to implement. Along with vaccination strategies, universal screening of adults and appropriate testing of persons at increased risk for HBV infection will improve health outcomes, reduce the prevalence of HBV infection in the United States, and advance viral hepatitis elimination goals.

AASLD-IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — counseling and clinical care for persons with active HCV infection: Persons with current HCV infection should receive education and interventions aimed at reducing liver disease progression and preventing HCV transmission (IIa, B), and all persons with HCV infection should be provided education about how to prevent HCV transmission to others (I, C); evaluation for advanced fibrosis using noninvasive markers (or liver biopsy, if required) is recommended for all persons with HCV infection to facilitate an appropriate decision regarding HCV treatment strategy and to determine the need for initiating additional measures for cirrhosis management (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] screening) (I, A), and evaluation for other conditions that may accelerate liver fibrosis, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV infections, is recommended for all persons with active HCV infection (IIb, B); vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B is recommended for all susceptible persons with HCV infection (IIa, C), and vaccination against pneumococcal infection is recommended for all persons with cirrhosis (IIa, C); abstinence from alcohol and, when appropriate, pharmacologic therapy for alcohol use disorder aimed at reducing consumption should be advised for all persons with HCV infection (IIa, B).

CDC Guidance and Recommendations

Test the Source Patient

Baseline testing of the source patient should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure (Figure 1) (Box). This guidance provides two options for initial source patient testing: 1) option A (preferred), to test for HCV RNA, or 2) option B, to test for anti-HCV and then if positive, test for HCV RNA (Figure 1). All source patients who are anti-HCV positive should be tested by a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA, preferably with a reflex test by using the same specimen if cross-contamination is not a concern or by using a fresh aliquot of the same sample if stored correctly. If HCV RNA tests are positive but the RNA level is less than the lower limit of quantitation of the assay, the results are reported as < XX IU/mL (e.g. < 15 IU/mL if the lower limit of quantitation of the assay is 15 IU/mL). This means that HCV RNA was detected in the sample but is not quantifiable and that the person from whom the sample was collected should be considered to have current HCV infection.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115GsP5B]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment outcomes in adults — noncirrhotic populations identified by screening showed high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates and few short-term deaths, with SVR associated with better clinical outcomes. Treatment studies focused on populations without cirrhosis who are more likely to be asymptomatic and identified by screening. Of the trials of DAA regimens (n = 7167; 26% to 69% female; mean age, 45 to 62 years), 14 were multicountry, 11 were conducted in the US or Canada, and in 29 trials, 60% to 100% of patients were white. Treatment duration was 12 weeks in all but 2 trials, which allocated patients to either 8 or 12 weeks of treatment; eleven trials were of good quality and 22 were of fair quality. Forty-nine trials found DAA regimens to be associated with pooled SVR rates ranging from 95.5% to 98.9% across genotypes. Trials reporting short-term mortality (1 year) found few events; twenty-one trials reported no deaths, and in the other 10 trials there were 17 deaths (0.4% [17/3848]) overall. Sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy was associated with reduced risk versus no SVR for all-cause mortality (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.28–0.56]), liver mortality (pooled HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04–0.27]), cirrhosis (pooled HR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33–0.40]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23–0.38]).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115C1vif]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology and screening considerations in youth with HIV — "No HCV preventative or prophylactic vaccine is available. IDU is the most reported risk factor for HCV infection in the United States". Rising IDU has fueled "increases of new infections among individuals aged < 40 in the United States since 2006, with the highest rates in nonurban communities". This "prompted the current recommendation for one-time screening of all adults 18 years and older and for pregnant women during each pregnancy", and although adolescents were not included, "it is appropriate to adapt HCV screening and testing to younger populations or more frequent intervals based on ongoing risk of HCV exposure". Additionally, "multiple outbreaks of HCV infection have been reported among MSM with HIV who do not use injection drugs, linked most strongly with inconsistent condom use and other high-risk practices, including having sex while intoxicated on drugs and having multiple sexual partners".

The ages of patients with chronic HBV infection (when available) are included in the summary table (Supplementary Table 11). No clear trends were identified in the prevalence of chronic HBV infection by age across studies. Therefore, the work group considered the economic analysis, vaccination rates and efficacy, the epidemiology of acute and chronic infections from surveillance data, ease of implementation, and harms of missed identification of chronic infections in determining the age thresholds for universal adult screening.

Q1b: What is the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests completed) and sensitivity of alternative HBV screening strategies (e.g. universal versus targeted screening or screening strategies based on alternative risk factors)?

As part of their HBV screening recommendations systematic review, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assessed the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests completed) and sensitivity of alternative HBV infection screening strategies. USPSTF identified three fair quality, non-U.S.–based studies, which might limit applicability. On the basis of these studies, the number of persons who need to be screened to identify one HBV infection using risk-based strategies ranged from 32 to 148. In comparison, fewer than 20 persons need to be screened to identify a case of HCV infection using risk-based screening.

Only one of the studies, conducted in France, assessed CDC's risk-based testing criteria. Using risk-based testing had 100% sensitivity (i.e. 100% of infected persons were identified), and self-report identified 70% of persons with at least one risk factor; however, the study population specifically overrepresented persons at increased risk for infection.

The work group also considered a prospective cohort study of patients with cancer at one U.S. health center, where applying CDC risk criteria to screening had 97% sensitivity. The proportion of patients who met at least one risk criterion was 91%. Therefore, in terms of provider time, universal screening might be more efficient than risk-based testing. Because no studies directly assessed universal screening, the work group could not provide the yield of universal screening versus risk-based screening.

### Testing for HCV infection: an update of guidance for clinicians and laboratorians [^116YiNpx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

In the United States, an estimated 4.1 million persons have been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), of whom an estimated 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7–3.9) million are living with the infection. New infections continue to be reported particularly among persons who inject drugs and persons exposed to HCV-contaminated blood in health-care settings with inadequate infection control.

Since 1998, CDC has recommended HCV testing for persons with risks for HCV infection. In 2003, CDC published guidelines for the laboratory testing and result reporting of antibody to HCV. In 2012, CDC amended testing recommendations to include one-time HCV testing for all persons born during 1945–1965 regardless of other risk factors.

CDC is issuing this update in guidance because of 1) changes in the availability of certain commercial HCV antibody tests, 2) evidence that many persons who are identified as reactive by an HCV antibody test might not subsequently be evaluated to determine if they have current HCV infection, and 3) significant advances in the development of antiviral agents with improved efficacy against HCV. Although previous guidance has focused on strategies to detect and confirm HCV antibody, reactive results from HCV antibody testing cannot distinguish between persons whose past HCV infection has resolved and those who are currently HCV infected. Persons with current infection who are not identified as currently infected will not receive appropriate preventive services, clinical evaluation, and medical treatment. Testing strategies must ensure the identification of those persons with current HCV infection.

This guidance was written by a workgroup convened by CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), comprising experts from CDC, APHL, state and local public health departments, and academic and independent diagnostic testing laboratories, in consultation with experts from the Veterans Health Administration and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The workgroup reviewed laboratory capacities and practices relating to HCV testing, data presented at the CDC 2011 symposium on identification, screening and surveillance of HCV infection, and data from published scientific literature on HCV testing. Unpublished data from the American Red Cross on validation of HCV antibody testing also were reviewed.

### Recommendations for the management of hepatitis C virus infection among people who inject drugs [^11741Xi8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In the developed world, the majority of new and existing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections occur among people who inject drugs (PWID). The burden of HCV-related liver disease in this group is increasing, but treatment uptake among PWID remains low. Among PWID, there are a number of barriers to care that should be considered and systematically addressed, but these barriers should not exclude PWID from HCV treatment. Furthermore, it has been clearly demonstrated that HCV treatment is safe and effective across a broad range of multidisciplinary healthcare settings. Given the burden of HCV-related disease among PWID, strategies to enhance HCV assessment and treatment in this group are urgently needed. These recommendations demonstrate that treatment among PWID is feasible and provides a framework for HCV assessment, management, and treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate strategies to enhance assessment, adherence, and SVR among PWID, particularly as new treatments for HCV infection become available.
