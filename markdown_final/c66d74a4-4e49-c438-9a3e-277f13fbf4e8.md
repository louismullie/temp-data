## Question

i have a weird sensation in my chest, kinda like its tight or pressure. should i be worried?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether they should be worried about a weird chest sensation described as tightness or pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the red flags that mandate emergency evaluation. Then, I should verify how to characterize the symptom using guideline-based descriptors. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and which features make cardiac ischemia more or less likely. After that, I should review risk stratification and when testing is warranted. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, including when to call 911, and provide a concise bottom line with safety-netting advice.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that require urgent care. If the tightness or pressure is new, severe, persistent, or accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, lightheadedness, syncope, or radiation to the jaw, neck, back, arms, or upper abdomen, I should not delay calling 911 because these are classic anginal equivalents and could represent acute coronary syndrome or other life-threatening conditions [^5c7f11e0] [^0e24c17a] [^e8f14299].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom terminology before jumping ahead. Patients often say "tightness" or "pressure" rather than "pain", and guidelines explicitly advise using "chest discomfort" to encompass these descriptors because they can still reflect myocardial ischemia; I should also note whether the sensation is substernal, diffuse, and difficult to localize, which is more consistent with ischemia, versus sharp, pleuritic, positional, or point-tender, which lowers the likelihood of ischemia [^e8f14299] [^a57daec7] [^3fe2feb4].

> I need to check the timing and triggers next. Angina typically builds over minutes, is provoked by exertion or emotional stress, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, whereas fleeting seconds-long discomfort is less likely to be ischemic; however, relief with nitroglycerin is not diagnostic of ischemia and should not be used as a standalone criterion, so I should not overinterpret a transient response [^3fe2feb4] [^e337b9d1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about noncardiac causes. Chest tightness is relatively specific for bronchoconstriction in asthma and can also occur in COPD, but it is not exclusive to airways disease; it can still be an anginal equivalent, especially when exertional or accompanied by dyspnea, so I should weigh the whole context rather than a single descriptor [^7c00cf3b] [^1f7ad5f6] [^e8f14299].

> I should confirm risk factors because they shift pretest probability. Age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, and chronic kidney disease increase the likelihood of cardiac ischemia; women and people with diabetes may have atypical presentations, so I need to maintain a lower threshold for evaluation in those groups [^e8f14299] [^0f857608].

> Next, I should review what to do right now. If any red flags are present, I should call 911 immediately. If there are no red flags but the symptom is new, recurrent, or concerning, I should seek same-day urgent evaluation rather than waiting, because early assessment with ECG and high-sensitivity troponin is the standard for excluding acute coronary syndrome and other serious causes [^5c7f11e0] [^0e24c17a] [^e8f14299].

> Let me consider what not to do. I should not try to self-diagnose based on whether nitroglycerin helps, I should not dismiss the symptom as "just anxiety" without a proper evaluation, and I should not use the term "atypical chest pain" because it is misleading; instead, I should describe it as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac based on the overall assessment [^3fe2feb4] [^b4b78306] [^1f174986].

> I should double-check medication contributors. If the patient uses triptans for migraine, chest or throat tightness is a known adverse effect and can rarely reflect coronary vasospasm; in that scenario, I should pause the triptan and seek medical evaluation, particularly if there are cardiac risk factors or if the tightness is severe or persistent [^fb740453] [^4d8ddae7] [^ad1d5c43].

> But wait, what if the tightness is chronic and positional or reproducible with palpation? That pattern makes musculoskeletal or chest wall pain more likely, though I should still screen for cardiac risk and consider evaluation if symptoms change or new features emerge; in athletes, exertional chest tightness warrants consideration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but symptoms alone are unreliable and objective testing may be needed [^a57daec7] [^160113db].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the message is clear: yes, you should be concerned enough to act. New chest tightness or pressure warrants prompt medical evaluation because it can be an anginal equivalent, and only a clinician can determine the cause after history, exam, ECG, and troponin testing; if red flags are present, call 911. If not, seek urgent same-day care. Do not wait and see, and do not rely on self-treatment to decide whether it is serious [^5c7f11e0] [^0e24c17a] [^e8f14299].

Chest tightness or pressure can signal **serious conditions** such as heart attack, angina, or pulmonary embolism, especially if it's new, severe, or accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or radiation to the arm, jaw, or back [^e8f14299] [^367f8a1a]. Even if the cause is not cardiac, **prompt evaluation is essential** to rule out life-threatening disease and confirm a safe diagnosis [^5c7f11e0]. If symptoms are ongoing or worsening, **call 911**; if they have resolved but are new or concerning, **seek urgent care within 24 hours**.

## Potential causes of chest tightness or pressure

Chest tightness or pressure has a broad differential, including **cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and psychological causes**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Cardiac | - Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [^e8f14299] <br/> - Stable angina [^e337b9d1] <br/> - Pericarditis [^9da6938f] <br/> - Myocarditis [^notfound] |
| Pulmonary | - Asthma [^7c00cf3b] <br/> - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^1f7ad5f6] <br/> - Pulmonary embolism [^367f8a1a] <br/> - Pneumothorax [^notfound] <br/> - Pneumonia [^98caba6b] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^98caba6b] <br/> - Esophageal spasm [^notfound] <br/> - Peptic ulcer disease [^notfound] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Costochondritis [^notfound] <br/> - Muscle strain [^notfound] <br/> - Rib fracture [^notfound] |
| Psychological | - Anxiety [^a1d065e6] <br/> - Panic disorder [^e2e51e60] |

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain features indicate a **high risk of serious disease** and warrant immediate emergency evaluation:

- **Severe or crushing chest pain**: Especially if radiating to the arm, jaw, neck, or back [^e337b9d1].
- **Shortness of breath**: Particularly if sudden or severe [^367f8a1a].
- **Sweating, nausea, or vomiting**: Especially with chest discomfort [^e337b9d1].
- **Lightheadedness or syncope**: Suggesting hemodynamic instability [^notfound].
- **Palpitations or irregular heartbeat**: May indicate arrhythmia or myocardial ischemia [^notfound].
- **Recent surgery, prolonged immobilization, or cancer**: Increases risk of pulmonary embolism [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for cardiac-related chest tightness

Several factors increase the likelihood that chest tightness is **cardiac in origin**:

- **Age**: Men ≥ 45 years, women ≥ 55 years.
- **Gender**: Men have a higher risk, but women are more likely to have atypical presentations [^0f857608].
- **Family history**: Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in first-degree relatives [^notfound].
- **Personal history**: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle [^f22e262e].
- **Medical conditions**: Known CAD, peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

When chest tightness or pressure is reported, clinicians typically follow a **structured evaluation**:

- **History and physical examination**: Characterize symptoms, risk factors, and associated features [^0e67d108].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Essential to assess for ischemia or arrhythmia [^0e67d108].
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: High-sensitivity troponin to detect myocardial injury [^5c7f11e0].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, echocardiography, or computed tomography (CT) as indicated [^a1d065e6].
- **Specialized tests**: Stress testing, coronary angiography, or pulmonary function tests based on suspicion [^a1d065e6].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Given the potential severity of underlying causes, **seek medical attention** if:

- **New-onset chest tightness or pressure**: Especially if persistent or recurrent [^5c7f11e0].
- **Change in pattern**: Different from previously experienced symptoms [^e8f14299].
- **Associated symptoms**: Shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, or palpitations [^e337b9d1].
- **High-risk profile**: Multiple cardiac risk factors or known CAD [^f22e262e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Chest tightness or pressure is a **concerning symptom** that warrants prompt medical evaluation to exclude serious conditions such as ACS, pulmonary embolism, or severe asthma/COPD exacerbation [^367f8a1a]. Even if the cause is not cardiac, early assessment is critical to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment. If symptoms are ongoing or worsening, **call 911**; if they have resolved but are new or concerning, **seek urgent care within 24 hours**.

Tightness sensation in asthma — afferent origin and dissociation from work — is commonly experienced during bronchoconstriction, and bronchoconstriction gives rise to both tightness and added physical work of breathing, yet blocking pulmonary afferents can diminish tightness; mechanical ventilation can eliminate the sense of excessive respiratory work but does not diminish tightness, and together these findings suggest that tightness arises from pulmonary afferents rather than being a work-related sensation.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

### Dyspnoea: underlying mechanisms and treatment [^5f291fdf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspnoea is the result of a complex interaction of physiological, psychosocial, social, and environmental factors. Although several sensory receptors located throughout the respiratory system are considered to be responsible for generation of dyspnoea, there is no afferent receptor solely responsible for the sensation of dyspnoea. Afferent information from the sensory receptors is processed at the cortex along with the respiratory motor command from the cortex and brainstem, and a mismatch between the motor command and the incoming afferent information may result in dyspnoea. Dyspnoea is not a single sensation and there are at least three distinct sensations including air hunger, work/effort, and chest tightness. Like pain, dyspnoea has at least two distinct separate dimensions, that is, a sensory and an affective dimension. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that neural structures subserving pain and dyspnoea might be shared, and therefore the neurophysiological and psychophysical approaches used to understand pain can be applied to dyspnoea research. Although effective treatment of dyspnoea remains an elusive goal at the moment, a better understanding of the pathophysiology and neurophysiology of dyspnoea may provide a rationale for effective therapy of dyspnoea. In this context, treatment strategies in dyspnoea should be similar to those used in pain.

Dyspnea definition and prognostic associations — dyspnea is defined as a "subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", and evidence indicates prognostic value: "dyspnea is a predictor of hospitalization and mortality in patients with chronic lung disease", and "in some cases is more closely correlated with 5-year survival than forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)", with dyspnea "more closely associated with cardiac mortality than angina". Advances also support that "different sensations may reflect different pathways associated with different sensory qualities (notably work/effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration)".

### "Tightness" sensation of asthma does not arise from the work of breathing [^de6c0610]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma evokes several uncomfortable sensations including increased "effort to breathe" and chest "tightness". We have tested the hypotheses that "effort" and "tightness" are due to perception of increased work performed by the respiratory muscles. Bronchoconstriction was induced by inhaled methacholine in 15 subjects with mild asthma (FEV(1)/FVC baseline = 81.9% ± 5.8; bronchoconstriction = 64.0% ± 8.6). To relieve the work of breathing, and thereby minimize activation of respiratory muscle afferents and motor command, subjects were mechanically ventilated. Subjects separately rated effort to breathe and tightness during mechanical ventilation and during spontaneous breathing. Bronchoconstriction produced elevated end-expiratory lung volume (279 ± 62 ml); in a control study, end-expiratory lung volume was increased equally in the absence of bronchoconstriction by increasing end-expiratory pressure. During bronchoconstriction, ratings of effort were greater during spontaneous breathing than during mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05). Ratings of tightness were unchanged by the absence of respiratory muscle activity (p = 0.12). Hyperinflation alone did not produce tightness or effort. We conclude that tightness is not related to the increase in respiratory work during bronchoconstriction.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — major conclusions on mechanisms highlight sensory sources and specific percepts. "A wide range of information arising from numerous sensory afferent sources (Table 2) contributes to multiple sensations of dyspnea (Table 3). Specific physiological processes may be linked to corresponding sensory descriptors, the best characterized of which are sensations of work or effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration". Additional conclusions state, "Sensory–perceptual mechanisms underlying sensations of work or effort and of breathing are similar to those underlying similar sensations in exercising muscle", "Tightness is relatively specific to stimulation of airway receptors in conjunction with bronchoconstriction", and "Intensity of air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration is magnified by imbalances among inspiratory drive, efferent activation (outgoing motor command from the brain), and feedback from afferent receptors throughout the respiratory system".

Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic.

### 'The body says it': the difficulty of measuring and communicating sensations of breathlessness [^84b72b1d]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

"when exercising, my breathing requires muscle effort or work", I don't, it just [mimics] "gasps gasps", is that me? my muscles working or my brain telling my lungs to start working, that's not muscle effort, I don't think so, to me my lungs haven't got any muscles, have they? your diaphragm, if you breathe in, deeply from your tummy up, that pushes your lungs up but thats your diaphragm working not your lungs working isn't it? (BeCR)

For another participant the idea of muscle effort and work only made sense when seen as related to the sensation of tightness and effort needed to support the exhale:

"Breathing requires muscle work or effort". Oh right, yes, a bit like tight chest… When [my mother] was wheezy… one thing she would do is, as she breathed out, she would put her hands on the side of her rib cage and push downwards, pushing the rib cage in at the base to help with her breathing out. So that's muscle work and effort. (BE-CL)

'My breathing requires mental effort or concentration'

Similar to the previous questionnaire item this caused some difficulty in comprehension and was interpreted in a variety of ways. Participants responded more easily to the word 'concentration' than 'mental effort'. Mental effort was interpreted to mean three different types of thinking: the thinking involved in avoiding becoming breathless, the thinking involved in pacing oneself or persevering in an activity that makes one breathless, and the thinking involved in applying certain breathing techniques or the effort it takes to relax or distract oneself during a breathless episode. For others the terms just caused confusion or were interpreted to mean 'mental health'. Confusion for some was linked to viewing the breath (and breathlessness) as an automatic bodily process, beyond conscious thought. A range of emotions were associated with the phrase 'mental concentration', including worry, fear, stoicism, frustration, courage and perseverance. Again comparisons were made between the mental effort involved when at rest compared with when active or when 'it gets out of hand'. Participants associated the all absorbing nature of being concentrated on their breath with a poor quality of life.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### 'The body says it': the difficulty of measuring and communicating sensations of breathlessness [^d500781d]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary focus of most studies of breathlessness sensation has been to determine whether different patterns of sensory qualities discriminate among various diagnoses, with more recent studies exploring the extent to which sensory qualities of breathlessness may vary with changes in health status within a single diagnosis. 22 The authors of the MDP assure us that the 'Content validity of the MDP items is strong because each item is based on earlier studies in which clinical experts and patients evaluated their clarity and salience'. 14 Two of these foundational studies assessed the validity of the investigator's descriptors of breathlessness by consulting a panel of experts. 23, 24 Parshall's work is distinct in that prior to administering the descriptor breathlessness questionnaire, researchers asked one open-ended question: 'what words would you use to describe what your breathing felt like when you decided to come to the emergency room?' 25 Parshall then evaluated the similarity to open-ended characteristics with the number and percentage of descriptor choices. The claims for a strong content validity of the MDP questionnaire items have also been strengthened by a recent independent comparison of the MDP with other measures of breathlessness reporting that the MDP 'was readily understood by patients'. 26

The MDP attempts to measure the 'incommunicable' different sensory qualities (and emotional responses) of breathlessness. Its authors tell us the MDP was 'developed from existing instruments for pain and dyspnea and subsequently refined through laboratory work'. 27 It comprises 12 items: an immediate sensory intensity item, an immediate unpleasantness item, five items addressing sensory qualities (eg, tightness, muscle work) and five emotional response items (eg, frustration, anxiety). Sensory qualities of dyspnoea were reduced from a list of 19 descriptors to 5 descriptors group based on previous factor analysis in patients and laboratory use in healthy subjects and patients. The emotional response items were adapted from pain research.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

RELPAX should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.

5.1	Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina

RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of RELPAX. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. RELPAX may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving RELPAX. Do not use RELPAX if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first RELPAX dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of RELPAX. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of RELPAX.

5.2	Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue RELPAX if these disturbances occur. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3	Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with RELPAX and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see Contraindications (4)].

### Understanding changes in dyspnoea perception in obstructive lung disease after mindfulness training [^55814f39]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Mindfulness training teaches participants to notice their sensory experience of breathing in ways they may not have explored before. This new information about the sensory experience of their breathing impacts on how they experience and relate to their dyspnoea:

I was on loads of inhalers in week 1. I don't take my inhaler daily anymore. I just take it two or three times a week. I've not really had to grab it at all. When you first asked us to breathe into our bellies, I was a bit, 'I can't do that'. It was all an effort. I just feel my lungs are a lot clearer and I'm taking a lot of pressure off this top bit (points to chest). I feel that my breath goes all the way through (to the belly), rather than just here (stopping at the diaphragm). (Asthma, F, Inquiry data, wk 7)

For some participants, being asked to imagine the breath going beyond the pharynx, trachea and lungs and notice movements of the breath in the lower abdomen facilitates a new relationship with the breath and dyspnoea.

For other participants, focusing on their breathing in their abdomen intensified the experience of discomfort in their chest. These participants still used the mindfulness skill of re-directing attention, but instead of using sensations of abdominal breathing, they chose another part of the body:

The bit I found most difficult was concentrating on my breathing. As I did, it became more difficult, I felt as though I was hungry for air. I kept thinking, your breath is failing, it's uncomfortable. But it was only uncomfortable when I was thinking about it. I could feel my tummy moving up and down but the tightness was here (across chest). An incomplete feeling, I wanted to gasp. I thought it the most bizarre place (to concentrate on my knees) but it just worked, it (the distress) went immediately. I just pictured both of my knees, the cartilage and the muscle, that stretch and immediately the tension went from my chest. I stopped thinking about it. (COPD, F, Inquiry data, wk 3)

### Understanding changes in dyspnoea perception in obstructive lung disease after mindfulness training [^72a5b700]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Focusing attention on bodily sensations in the knees leaves less space for rumination and catastrophising thoughts about dyspnoea. It redirects attentional resources away from ruminative thinking. In terms of the MDP model, focusing on another sensory dimension (in the knees) rather than the sensations of air hunger and chest tightness had a calming effect on the breath: "I pictured both my knees… immediately the tension went from my chest".

Similarly, for another participant, re-directing their attention to noticing sensations in other parts of the body helped relieve perceptions of tightness in the chest:

(T)hat was the connection that I made right at the beginning. Doing that body scan enabled me to take the emphasis from my chest onto somewhere else. And I find that my chest then functions good on its own. (COPD, M, Interview data)

### Patients' and health professionals' perceptions of the LoDED (limit of detection and ECG discharge) strategy for low-risk chest pain management: a qualitative study [^f84d5235]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

A reservation in relation to the LoDED strategy was its use by those with limited clinical experience (in years and expertise) who might rely too heavily on one blood test, further impacted by the shortened observation period associated with the pathway that could lead to early discharge of a high-risk patient:

I've just got a niggling concern that sometimes chest pain is viewed as, so long as your troponin is negative then you're home and dry,… and currently I guess with the six hour pathway we have this window to observe the patient on the CDU… to give the junior clinician some time to see that patient and let those diagnostic thoughts happen (ED doctor_14, Male: Focus group 2)

In contrast, it was also pointed out that a lack of continuity of care associated with multiple diagnosing and treating health professionals using the serial testing strategy, could contribute to missing a serious diagnosis and early discharge:

I am not sure to what degree they get a thoughtful review with the second one [troponin test result]. I suspect if we make the discharge decision when the patients actually are in front of us in the department… that might be an advantage of doing it sooner. At the moment they do get quite dislocated from the clinician who made the initial assessment… (ED doctor_19, Male: Focus group 2)

Theme 2: perceptions of symptom severity and uncertainty

Identification and experience of chest pain

Patients described uncertainty about the severity of their symptoms, and whether or not pain was indicative of myocardial infarction or something less serious. All had experienced some form of chest, muscle pain or 'tightness' in the chest; some also reported a cold sweat, dizziness and feeling sick; patients carried out their own 'risk assessment' with some deciding to go to the ED themselves, others were told by family or colleagues that they should attend:

I came into work and I had chest pains, and it was peculiar because it didn't really feel like anything I had felt before, and I spoke to some people at work about it and… went through this first aiders test and they said the best thing to do really is just to go into ED… (Patient_12, Male, 50 years: LoDED Intervention arm)

### Zolmitriptan [^ad1d5c43]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are:

pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw
dizziness
tingling or other abnormal sensations
tiredness
drowsiness
feeling warm or cold
nausea
feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body
dry mouth

In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets:

severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw
shortness of breath or wheezing
sudden or severe stomach pain
hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling
problems seeing
unusual weakness or numbness

Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets.

6.1 Clinical Trials
Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth.

Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the ZOMIG 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of ZOMIG in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a ZOMIG group compared to the placebo group are included.

Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

### Interpreting angina: symptoms along a gender continuum [^6a482734]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Other associated symptoms

In addition to localised areas of pain, almost all women and men reported shortness of breath with some difficulty breathing and periods of profuse sweating followed by coldness/clamminess with their localised pain. Men expressed 'feeling pale' and 'feelings of aggravation'. Women provided detailed accounts of many other concurrent symptoms including dizziness, weakness, sweating at night, feeling faint/fainting, fatigue, dry mouth, confusion, anxiety and panic. Women would often recall other associated symptoms throughout the interview, even when discussing other topics (figures 1 and 2).

Functional symptoms

Almost all patients in our study complained of shortness of breath, especially on exertion, often accompanied by chest pain/discomfort. Most patients reported experiencing shortness of breath for some time before seeking medical attention (figure 1). However, patients reported stopping, slowing down, limiting or avoiding physical activity altogether when experiencing or anticipating 'shortness of breath'. Older patients often decreased overall activity to avoid this symptom (figure 2).

Descriptors of pain/discomfort

Men and women had distinct differences in the terms they used to capture their pain/discomfort. Overall, men used succinct language to report their symptoms. Men would report 'chest pain', often qualifying their pain/discomfort with terms such as 'not severe, uncomfortable' and 'not a huge pain'. Women and men commonly emphasised that it was 'not a sharp pain', 'it was more of a tightness', 'discomfort', 'a very funny pain'. There was some unwillingness to commit to use the term 'pain' to describe their sensation, correcting the attending clinician's use of the term, 'pain', opting for more preferred terms such as 'discomfort', 'pressure', 'tightness' and 'weakness' (figure 2). Women would spend more time than men searching for a more accurate descriptive term to capture their sensation, and most often described it as a 'pressure'. The expansiveness of chest 'pain' descriptions increase along the gender continuum, with women using a greater number of descriptive terms to describe their pain compared to men (figures 1 and 2).

### Understanding changes in dyspnoea perception in obstructive lung disease after mindfulness training [^b3f82ad8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Through mindful awareness, the participant has gained new information about the sensory aspect of her experience, allowing her to reconfigure her experience of the breathing discomfort, rather than how she had imagined the sensory dimension and breathing discomfort to be: 'I'd always imagined that was in my chest'.

Similarly, one participant described being able to identify an earlier warning sign in the body that a breathless episode was threatening to develop:

The hospital has always said you will start to feel yourself going tight. I found, before I go tight, my shoulders go up which causes the tightness to your chest. You start to panic. I haven't done that for ages. I've realised, pull your shoulders down, it bloody stops it (tightness in chest)! (COPD, M, Interview data)

Participants with COPD and asthma learnt to identify subtle body sensations that previously they had not been aware of. In the MDP model, the sensory dimension and breathing discomfort are aligned as the immediate perception domain. In the examples explored above, mindfulness training in a type of informative attention begins with detailed noticing of the immediate sensory experience. In terms of the MDP model, attending mindfully to sensory experience facilitates changes in both the immediate perception domain, with reductions in the immediate unpleasantness of sensations, as well as influencing changes in the emotional response domain — such as reductions in reported anxiety and panic.

Re-directing attention to alternate sensory experience

In MBCT, participants are invited to experience their breath beyond the normal respiratory anatomical structures, to feel the movements of the breath in their lower belly and back. For people with chronic respiratory symptoms, this was initially challenging, but became a way to re-direct attention away from feelings of constriction in their chest:

I was surprised about the amount of breathing I could actually feel coming from my tummy. At the start I was a bit nervous about trying to focus on that area. But the more I tried to feel what was coming from my tummy, I could actually feel something. It was almost blocking off of anything (unpleasant) I could feel coming from the chest. I go (to my belly) automatically now. I just do it without thinking. It's a different kind of breath. (Asthma, F, Inquiry data, wk 8)

### Almotriptan [^4d8ddae7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of almotriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received almotriptan tablets. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an ECG during the interval immediately following almotriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of almotriptan tablets and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use almotriptan tablets.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to almotriptan tablets. The ability of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect all cardiovascular diseases or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest at best. Cardiovascular events associated with triptan treatment have occurred in patients with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease.

5.2 Sensations of Pain, Tightness, Pressure in the Chest and/or Throat, Neck, and Jaw

As with other 5-HT1agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw have been reported after treatment with almotriptan tablets. Because 5-HT1agonists may cause coronary vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms occur. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1agonists [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Wheezing and chest tightness — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes and chest tightness may vary between days and over a single day, and widespread inspiratory or expiratory wheezes can be present on auscultation. Chest tightness often follows exertion, is poorly localized, is muscular in character, and may arise from isometric contraction of the intercostal muscles. An absence of wheezing or chest tightness does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD, nor does the presence of these symptoms confirm a diagnosis of asthma.

### If we should remove internal fixation devices for rib fractures? [^02445243]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Surgical internal fixation has been generally accepted to be the most effective treatment for multiple rib fractures or flail chest. Our previous study has also confirmed that surgical internal fixation can rapidly relieve the respiratory impairment and pain caused by rib fractures. However, doctors and patients in different countries have distinct perceptions about whether the internal fixation devices need to be removed. As the surgical internal fixation for rib fractures has not been carried out for a long time, we lack reference data to support any theory.

According to our study, it was found that the patients undergoing removal of internal fixation could be divided into two groups. One group without any discomfort concerning about the implants retained in the body due to social and cultural factors, and still hoped to remove the implants. In our study, most of these patients recovered well after removal of internal fixation without obvious postoperative complications, but 2 presented chest wall pain and 3 had a sense of tightness around the wound after removal. The possible reason lies in that the bone may be damaged to a certain extent during the operation, resulting in postoperative chest pain. The appearance of the sense of tightness around the wound is firstly considered to be resulted from local contracture caused by scar healing. The probability of secondary trauma will be increased in removal of internal fixation to a certain extent.

For the other group with discomforts, internal fixation for rib fractures would still bring some adverse effects to partial patients, including pain, foreign-body sensation and discomforts. Although the proportions were not high, they would still affect the quality of life of the patients. Based on our data, the majority of the symptomatic patients had obvious remission of their discomforts after removal of the internal fixation. Among them, some symptoms of the patients with a preoperative sense of numbness and tightness were relieved after implant removal. Therefore, we consider that this sense of numbness and tightness is not only caused by the nerve terminal injury and scar healing caused by surgery, but also related to the implantation of internal fixation materials. Other similar chest tightness, foreign-body sensation and poor wound healing were significantly improved after removal of the internal fixation. Consequently, for these patients, we believe that the removal of internal fixation is still necessary and valuable.

### Do female and male chests feel the same? A comprehensive quantitative sensory analysis [^567e916f]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is growing interest in understanding chest sensory function due to the significant morbidity associated with impaired sensation following nerve injury. While the baseline quantitative sensory and pain thresholds in female and male patients have been studied in various other anatomic areas, there is little knowledge on quantitative sensation at the chest as well as the presence of possible gender differences. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a comprehensive quantitative sensory analysis to determine if female and male chests feel the same.

Methods

A total of 100 chests in 50 subjects (25 females and 25 males) were evaluated. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was performed on the nipple areola complex (NAC) and surrounding chest skin and included mechanical detection using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, two-point discrimination, vibration detection, pin prick, cold detection, warm detection, heat pain and pressure pain thresholds.

Results

Male chests were significantly more sensitive to mechanical detection, two-point discrimination, vibration, pin prick as well as cold and warm detection at both the NAC and chest as compared to female chests (p < 0.05). Females had significantly lower sensory thresholds to heat pain and pressure pain detection at both the NAC and chest as compared to males (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The quantitative sensory functions of female and male chests are significantly different. This knowledge helps to better understand baseline sensory functions at the chest and the awareness of gender differences in this anatomic area.

### Performance of the American Heart Association (AHA) 14-point evaluation versus electrocardiography for the cardiovascular screening of high school athletes: a prospective study [^b9378dda]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, ECG screening surpassed the AHA 14‐point evaluation in all statistical measures of performance. Importantly, the false‐positive rate for ECG, when interpreted by experienced clinicians using modern standards that distinguish physiologic cardiac adaptations from findings suggestive of cardiac pathology, was only 2.4%. The evolution and improved accuracy of ECG interpretation standards for athletes has readily improved specificity without compromising sensitivity. 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 The high number of false‐positive responses to the AHA 14‐point history questions creates a challenge for the examining clinician to determine which responses are clinically concerning and warrant additional investigation. In this study, experienced sports medicine and cardiology physicians determined that approximately half of the positive responses were noncardiac in nature. It is unclear in the broader clinical context how primary care providers react to these responses, if more information is gathered, if additional testing is ordered, or if a large number of positive history responses are simply ignored. Even if every athlete with a clinically relevant positive response undergoes an ECG as in this study, this still does not capture the majority of athletes with detectable conditions at risk for SCD.

Athletes may experience cardiovascular symptoms related to an underlying cardiac disorder. 30 However, it is not evident that screening with a history questionnaire will effectively identify athletes with relevant warning signs or symptoms. In this study, the history questionnaire generated a large number of positive responses, with 45.4% of subjects marking at least 1 affirmative response and 22.5% having at least 1 positive response that could not be excluded as noncardiac after physician review. The most common history responses pertained to "chest pain/pressure/tightness/discomfort related to exertion", "excessive and unexplained shortness of breath/fatigue or palpitations associated with exercise", and a listing of genetic cardiac conditions. The wording of these symptom inquiries is broad and nonspecific and may overlap with common physiologic sensations during exercise. The listing of genetic cardiac conditions is likely unfamiliar to the athlete, and families may mistake common conditions for the genetic disorders listed. More research is needed to understand what questions, with what wording, with what prompts, and in what format (ie, written, video, or verbal) may better detect athletes of all ages with cardiovascular symptoms warranting more evaluation.

### Other asthma considerations [^5d7747e5]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome of cough, wheeze, dyspnea, and chest tightness. However, in a subset of patients, these symptoms may indicate a different underlying disease process with variable responsiveness to classic asthma therapies. Disease may progress while practitioners attempt conventional asthma therapy. Additionally, some types of asthma may require alternative approaches to relieve symptoms successfully. This article describes the differential diagnosis of asthma and discusses some of the more common asthma variants and asthma mimickers.

### Risk for clinically relevant adverse cardiac events in patients with chest pain at hospital admission [^13193323]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patients with potentially ischemic chest pain are commonly admitted to the hospital or observed after a negative evaluation in the emergency department (ED) owing to concern about adverse events. Previous studies have looked at 30-day mortality, but no current large studies have examined the most important information regarding ED disposition: the short-term risk for a clinically relevant adverse cardiac event (including inpatient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, life-threatening arrhythmia, cardiac or respiratory arrest, or death).

Objective

To determine the incidence of clinically relevant adverse cardiac events in patients hospitalized for chest pain with 2 troponin-negative findings, nonconcerning initial ED vital signs, and nonischemic, interpretable electrocardiographic findings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a blinded data review of 45,416 encounters obtained from a prospectively collected database enrolling adult patients admitted or observed with the following inclusion criteria: (1) primary presenting symptom of chest pain, chest tightness, chest burning, or chest pressure and (2) negative findings for serial biomarkers. Data were collected and analyzed from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2013, from the EDs of 3 community teaching institutions with an aggregate census of more than 1 million visits. We analyzed data extracted by hypothesis-blinded abstractors.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of life-threatening arrhythmia, inpatient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, cardiac or respiratory arrest, or death during hospitalization.

Results

Of the 45,416 encounters, 11,230 met criteria for inclusion. Mean patient age was 58.0 years. Of the 11 230 encounters, 44.83% of patients arrived by ambulance and 55.00% of patients were women. Relevant history included hypertension in 46.00%, diabetes mellitus in 19.72%, and myocardial infarction in 13.16%. The primary end point occurred in 20 of the 11 230 patients (0.18% [95% CI, 0.11%-0.27%]). After excluding patients with abnormal vital signs, electrocardiographic ischemia, left bundle branch block, or a pacemaker rhythm, we identified a primary end point event in 4 of 7266 patients (0.06% [95% CI, 0.02%-0.14%]). Of these events, 2 were noncardiac and 2 were possibly iatrogenic.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adult patients with chest pain admitted with 2 negative findings for serial biomarkers, nonconcerning vital signs, and nonischemic electrocardiographic findings, short-term clinically relevant adverse cardiac events were rare and commonly iatrogenic, suggesting that routine inpatient admission may not be a beneficial strategy for this group.

### Differential diagnosis of chest symptoms in the athlete [^1c1e91c4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common complaint of athletes in all age groups. In athletes, chest pain is often attributed to "chest tightness", and treatment for bronchospasm is considered. However, the causes of the pain are wide and varied, and the pain is referable to the many organ systems that localize to the thorax. Therefore, when treatment with bronchodilators fails, it becomes important to consider other nonasthmatic causes of the pain. These causes can be organized by system and are explained in this article. Cardiac causes are the most feared and, fortunately, are very rare in the adolescent setting. With a thorough knowledge of etiologies of chest pain, the physician can often make a diagnosis with only a history and a physical exam.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of adapted cognitive behaviour therapy for non-cardiac chest pain: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^5854bc89]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-cardiac chest pain has the status of a medical diagnosis in the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases(ICD-10)(R07.89- non-cardiac chest pain) but shares this diagnosis with 20 other synonyms under the general heading of 'other chest pain' and is highly heterogeneous. It includes a range of disorders including a general description only (non-cardiac chest pain, atypical chest pain, non-specific chest pain), muscular tension (chest pain, musculoskeletal, chest pain, tightness, musculoskeletal chest pain), pain generated in other structures apart from the heart (sternal chest pain, chest wall pain, localised chest pain) and pain related to exertion (exertional chest pain, chest pain on exertion). None of the diagnostic labels include any indication of a psychological component, even though there is abundant literature on psychological interventions for the condition.

Despite this lack of attribution, it is suspected that a substantial proportion of patients with non-cardiac chest pain have psychological causes, or at least can be treated appropriately using psychological means. Possible causes include excessive health anxiety (termed illness anxiety in the 5th Revision of the American Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5), one or more variants of somatic symptom disorder, the former diagnosis of hypochondriasis, and obsessive compulsive disorder. But because these diagnoses are given by mental health professionals, and not by the physicians who make the diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain, they are seldom recorded in practice. Health anxiety has recently been associated with a future ischaemic heart disease in the general population over 12 years even when known risk factors for cardiovascular disease are controlled for. Health anxiety is also associated with adverse cardiac events in those who had myocardial infarction over the subsequent 4 years. Therefore health anxiety may be important to recognise and treat in its own right because of poor cardiac outcomes. Thus, despite good evidence that most of the people who present with non-cardiac chest pain do not have heart disease, we do not know how many have physical causes or precipitants and how many have psychological ones.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^bd375eb1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that "dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it", explains that "Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning", and concludes, "Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report". It further clarifies, "Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions", and that "Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality".

### Nitroglycerin tablet (Nitrostat) [^98c4f873]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain.

- The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved.

- If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help.

- NITROSTAT may be used 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain.

- You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take NITROSTAT.

What should I avoid while taking NITROSTAT?

- Do not breastfeed. It is not known if NITROSTAT will pass through your milk.

- Do not consume alcohol while taking NITROSTAT, as this can lower your blood pressure.

- Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first.

What are the possible side effects of NITROSTAT?

NITROSTAT may cause the following side effects:

- headache

- vertigo (a major symptom of balance disorder)

- dizziness

- weakness

- heart palpitations (unusual awareness of the heartbeat)

- low blood pressure upon rising from a seated position

- nausea and vomiting

- sweating

- paleness

- fainting

- flushing (warm or red condition of your skin)

- other skin reactions that may be severe

Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of NITROSTAT. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a57daec7]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

### Delayed care and mortality among women and men with myocardial infarction [^d55367b1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Data Collection and Definitions

The enrolled hospitals periodically uploaded their data to the central server of the ISACS‐TC. Registry data were collected by the designated physician at the time of clinical assessment. Killip classification at admission was determined by the attending physician in the emergency department. 17 Patients were asked about the quality of their symptoms. Typical chest pain was defined as any symptom of chest discomfort characterized by a sensation or pressure or tightness under the sternum or chest bone, with pain that may radiate to jaw, arms, or neck. The variable of atypical chest pain included both patients with atypical symptoms and those who were asymptomatic. Chest pain was considered to be atypical when its distribution was unusual, such as pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen or pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, or the stomach. Patients with angina "equivalents", such as dyspnea, and fatigue, were defined as asymptomatic.

### Does use of the CPREzy involve more work than CPR without feedback? [^cd757eb8]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

Feedback during CPR may facilitate quality in chest compressions, but has also been associated with caregiver complaints such as stiff wrists, the need for more force and increased fatigue. This concern about extra work is, when using the CPREzy with its own spring-loaded surface, particularly relevant in the face of an increased number of successive compressions. This manuscript evaluates the objective workloads for caregivers with and without the CPREzy.

Materials and Methods

An air pressure driven, piston device was used to generate controlled compressions in a manikin model. The pressure was applied for chest compressions with each of the following: the cylindrical end of the piston, a wooden block as dummy for the CPREzy, and the CPREzy itself. Three manikins with subjectively different spring compliances were selected for the tests. Series of 20 compressions were performed over a wide range of pressures.

Results

No additional force is required to achieve a given depth of compression with or without the CPREzy. However, some additional work is required, ranging from 21 to 26.5%. This work is caused by the longer compression distance associated with the need to compress two springs (e.g. the CPREzy and the chest wall) instead of one (e.g. the chest wall).

Conclusion

The subjective feeling of increased rescuer fatigue with the CPREzy can, at least in part, be attributed to the extra work required for compressing the spring of the CPREzy. Improved accuracy in chest compression depth is likely to be another, more significant, factor in rescuer fatigue.

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain – the big three [^e4cd8dd7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most frequently seen chief complaints in patients presenting to emergency departments, and is considered to be a "high-risk" chief complaint. The differential diagnosis for chest pain is broad, and potential causes range from the benign to the immediately life-threatening. Although many (if not most) emergency department patients with chest pain do not have an immediately life-threatening condition, correct diagnoses can be difficult to make, incorrect diagnoses may lead to catastrophic therapies, and failure to make a timely diagnosis may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Several atraumatic "high-risk" causes of chest pain are discussed in this article, including myocardial infarction and ischemia, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Also included are brief discussions of tension pneumothorax, esophageal perforation, and cardiac tamponade.

HBOT Safety

HBOT has been demonstrated to be safe as long as the treatment procedures for each portion are no longer than 120 minutes in length and the oxygen pressure is less than 3 atmospheres. When performed under adequate medical supervision, the use of high-pressure oxygen treatment is generally viewed as benign, safe, and associated with minimum risk.

It was discovered that 5.5% of the CRAO population experienced modest and temporary adverse effects, such as middle ear or sinus barotraumas, which recovered fully within a few days of being exposed to HBO. When a person's middle ear and the external environment are not equalized, it is known as barotrauma. This term refers to the stretching and tearing of their tympanic membrane as a result of their inability to equalize their pressure gradient, as explained above. Furthermore, HBO is performed in numerous sessions over a period of several days and necessitates the use of specialist equipment. A single treatment for CRAO patients with HBO cannot be called evidence-based due to the minimal number of research that have established its effectiveness.

As a result of the barotrauma effect caused by the sudden pressure change, one of the most common side effects of HBOT is oxygen convulsion. Other side effects include middle ear, cranial sinus, and lung rupture, which present with mild to moderate ache as a result of the sudden pressure change; and claustrophobia, which can occur in cabins with only one patient as a result of the sudden pressure change. Also likely are chest tightness, retrosternal burning sensations, and acute lung dysfunctions such as a dry cough while suffering from the condition. To avoid these negative consequences, seek medical advice and action as soon as possible after exposure to the HBO. HBOT, when compared to other forms of treatment, such as paracentesis, is a non-invasive, safe procedure that may be utilized for a range of purposes and has been demonstrated to be safe for patients with CRAO.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^c9bbbdd7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Many researchers have reported that upper back pain and fatigue are commonly reported symptoms during ACS, and up to 30% of patients do not experience chest pain. 19, 20 This information is important to consider as we try to differentiate patients who will be ruled in compared with those ruled out for ACS. We found that although chest pain is a sensitive symptom for ACS, it is not very specific (Table). 1 In fact, few other symptoms were sensitive or specific for a diagnosis of ACS. In our multicenter prospective study, we found few symptom differences between patients with and without ACS presenting to the ED. 13 Ferry et al 8 defined chest pain as all descriptors of chest symptoms, including pressure or discomfort. Their rationale was that terms other than pain are "functions of sex‐related language rather than symptom differences in symptom presentation". This is an opinion that is counterproductive to science and accurate assessment of symptoms, which are, by definition, subjective and what the patient says they are.

Table 1
Sensitivity and Specificity of Symptoms for ACS by Sex 1

We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results such as those of Ferry et al, 8 that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for ACS.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^dcccad53]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Summary of AE Data

The majority of studies analyzed herein were not prospectively designed to collect safety data. Accordingly, of the 1,124 studies included in this analysis, 982 studies did not mention safety and 75 studies variably reported that there were no complications, AEs, side effects, or patient-reported subjective feelings or symptoms. Eight studies reported ATII dose reductions or discontinuations due to excessive pressor responses. The remaining 59 studies reported the AEs listed in Tables 1 and 2. The most common symptoms (reported in ≥ 2 studies) were headache, sensation of chest pressure/tightness, dyspepsia/nausea, bradycardia, and orthostatic hypotension/dizziness. One occurrence of headache was characterized as severe. Patients with mild asthma reported cough or chest tightness. ATII was noted to exacerbate the left ventricular failure when administered to three patients with acute congestive heart failure. Frequent or severe gastrointestinal AEs occurred only when ATII was coadministered with chemotherapy.

TABLE 1.
Reported Adverse Events by Study — Healthy Volunteers

Among 192 pregnant teenaged girls monitored for ATII sensitivity during pregnancy, 72 developed preeclampsia including two who had complications at delivery (one stillbirth with placental abruption and one seizure following delivery of a healthy infant). These events occurred 6 and 12 days after the last ATII infusion, respectively. No AEs or pregnancy complications were reported for the 120 girls who remained normotensive during pregnancy.

A placebo-controlled study of ATII in the treatment of severely ill patients with catecholamine-resistant shock reported the following AEs in the ATII group (n = 10) but not in the placebo group (n = 10): alkalosis (four patients); hypertension (two patients); atrial fibrillation (two patients); and wheezing (one patient). The 30-day mortality rate was similar for the ATII and placebo groups (50% vs 60%; p = 1.00).

### Pooled individual patient data from five countries were used to derive a clinical prediction rule for coronary artery disease in primary care [^4afb8546]. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule for chest pain in primary care" for chest pain, coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule is a diagnostic tool used in primary care settings to evaluate patients presenting with chest pain. The name "INTERCHEST" is an abbreviation derived from the study "International Chest pain prediction rule" which developed this tool.

This calculator is specifically designed for adult patients who present to primary care with chest pain. Its primary clinical utility is to help clinicians estimate the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) in these patients. By considering various patient characteristics and symptoms, the INTERCHEST rule provides a score that can predict the likelihood of CAD, thereby aiding in decision-making about further diagnostic testing and management.

The INTERCHEST rule should not be used in patients with known CAD, those with a clear alternative diagnosis for their chest pain, or those with chest pain due to trauma. It is also not intended for use in emergency settings, where more acute causes of chest pain (such as myocardial infarction) need to be ruled out.

The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule is a tool designed to evaluate the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who present with chest pain in a primary care scenario. This assessment is achieved by reviewing a set of six distinct factors, each asking for a simple yes or no answer, which ultimately calculates a score indicating the likelihood of CAD.

These are the factors considered in the INTERCHEST rule:

- Is the patient male and aged 55 years or older, or female and aged 65 years or older?
- Does the patient have a history of coronary artery disease?
- Did the physician initially suspect a serious condition based on the patient's presentation?
- Does the chest discomfort feel like pressure to the patient?
- Is the chest pain related to physical effort or exertion?
- Can the pain be reproduced when the physician applies physical palpation?

Each affirmative answer to these questions adds one point to the total score, while a negative answer adds no points. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 6.

The interpretation of the INTERCHEST score helps guide clinical decision-making:

- A score of 1 or below indicates a low risk of coronary artery disease. This is related to an estimated CAD prevalence of about 2.1%.
- A score of 2 or above suggests a high risk, implying an estimated CAD prevalence of 43.0%.

This scoring system helps healthcare providers stratify risk and decide further management steps for patients with chest pain, ensuring that those who might need more intensive investigation or immediate intervention are identified promptly.

Diagnoses

Of the 227 patients with an ACS (91 women, 136 men), 67 (29.5%) patients had a STEMI (women 22.1%, men 33.8%), 93 (40.0%) a NSTEMI (women 46.2%, men 37.5%), 52 (22.9%) UAP (women 20.9%, men 24.3%) and 15 (6.6%) unspecified ACS, including three sudden cardiac deaths in women (women 9.9%, men 4.4%) (table 2). In nearly all cases (97.0%) the ACS diagnosis was from the cardiologist and based on symptom presentation, troponin levels and electrocardiography. Three patients died before arrival of the ambulance (they were classified as acute cardiac death) and one patient died after resuscitation at the ED. Three patients were classified as ACS by the GP, while not referred because of short life expectancy due to cancer. Of the 58 patients with other LTEs (2.9%), 13 had a pulmonary embolism, 5 an acute abdominal aneurysm, 5 a thoracic aortic dissection and 35 other diagnoses (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis). The majority of patients had non-urgent medical conditions (85.9%) including: non-urgent cardiovascular diseases (18.7%), non-cardiac chest pain (not further specified) (17.3%), musculoskeletal pain (17.9%), psychogenic disorders (11.2%), gastrointestinal disorders (7.1%), respiratory disorders (5.5%) and other non-urgent diagnoses (8.4%).

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^b479c37a]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Q29. A 55-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, a tight feeling on the chest, and palpitations for 3 h. In addition, she mentions a few episodes of intermittent chest discomfort over the last 6 months, lasting minutes but sometimes hours, occurring both at rest and during exercise. She has a positive family history for CAD. The initial ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130 bpm and then 96 bpm with no ischaemic changes after 30 minutes of a resting period. Initial and 1 h hs-cTn measures were 30 ng/L and 36 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L), respectively. A resident asks you, as supervisor of the emergency department/CPU, whether CCTA should be performed now to rule-out obstructive coronary artery disease.

CCTA has a high diagnostic accuracy for ruling out occlusive CAD. However, image quality and interpretability may be hampered when irregular heart rhythm is present. Although elevated levels of hs-cTn may be attributable to myocardial injury due to rapid ventricular rate response, a CCTA is recommended because of the chest discomfort during the last 6 months and the positive family history for CAD.

Q30. A just-appointed radiologist challenges the work-up of patients with acute chest pain by stating the following: 'Why bother with clinical evaluation, repeated cTn testing, and ECG assessments in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS? In the end, all need CCTA'. Is this statement correct?

Not at all. Broad adoption of non-invasive anatomic testing, in terms of CCTA, among inadequately risk stratified patients, has been shown to increase downstream testing and costs without clinical benefit for the patient. In addition, despite the reduction in radiation doses achieved in recent years, acquisition of high-quality images with low radiation exposure, as well as appropriate interpretation of CT images, is not usually available on a 24/7 basis at every institution.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate/urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the 3 most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain, acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition and other less common causes of lethal chest pain are also discussed.

Patient-Reported Outcomes

Questions were generated by the investigator team based on clinical experience given that no validated patient-reported outcome measures for chest sensory outcomes exist for transgender patients. Preoperatively, patients were asked to rate their level of concern for sensation, including light touch and protective and erogenous sensation (1 = not at all concerned, 2 = slightly concerned, 3 = somewhat concerned, 4 = very concerned, or 5 = extremely concerned). Postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, patients were asked to rate nipple sensation and chest light touch, chest pressure, the ability to feel cold, the ability to feel warm, the ability to feel a hug, the ability to feel water from the shower, erogenous sensation, and nipple erection (1 = none, 2 = a little, 3 = some, 4 = a lot, or 5 = complete). Satisfaction with nipple and chest sensation was determined at 12 months postoperatively (1 = extremely dissatisfied, 2 = very dissatisfied, 3 = somewhat dissatisfied, 4 = somewhat satisfied, 5 = very satisfied, or 6 = extremely satisfied). The full verbatim text of questions can be found in the eTable in Supplement 1. Data were recorded on REDCap version 8.1.20 (Vanderbilt University).

### Effects of sports bras and breast volume on pulmonary system and respiratory symptom responses to exercise in healthy females [^f001d14f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study assessed the individual and combined effects of sports bras and breast volume on pulmonary system and respiratory symptom responses to exercise in recreationally active females.

Methods

Twenty-three healthy females (18–27 yr; bra sizes 32B-36DDD) were divided into small and large breast volume groups (SBV and LBV, respectively) around median volume (324 mL; mean ± SD SBV: 284 ± 38 mL vs LBV: 560 ± 97 mL; P < 0.001, g = 3.84). Participants completed three 5-min bouts of constant-load cycle exercise at 30%, 60%, and 90% of their peak power output while wearing a high-support sports bra, low-support sports bralette, or their personal (self-selected) sports bra in randomized order. Measurements included ventilation, breathing pattern, respiratory pressures, diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), breathlessness (intensity and unpleasantness), and chest tightness due to bra.

Results

Compared with low-support and personal sports bras, the high-support sports bra evoked stronger sensations of restricted breathing and chest tightness ("slight" to "moderate" restriction in n = 7 (30%) vs n = 1 (4%) in low-support and personal bras; P = 0.014). There was, however, no evidence of greater concomitant inspiratory constraints, EMGdi, or inspiratory muscle pressure generation in either bra (all P > 0.05). Notably, LBV compared with SBV, participants reported greater RPE (P = 0.037, ηp2 = 0.20), breathlessness intensity (P = 0.039, ηp2 = 0.20), and unpleasantness (P = 0.041; ηp2 = 0.19), which, in the setting of comparable pulmonary system responses to exercise, was likely driven by stronger perceived chest tightness and/or bra awareness in LBV participants.

Conclusions

Despite evoking mild-to-moderately severe chest tightness due to bra during exercise, correctly fitted sports bras, whether low- or high-support, do not impose a physiological burden to the respiratory system and its response to mild-to-heavy intensity exercise in otherwise healthy females.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, and heart attacks are a major category of heart disease; someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds (1). February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to remind all adults to focus on their hearts and encourage them, their families, friends, and communities to learn the important signs and symptoms of heart attack and how to respond. Recognizing that someone might be having a heart attack and calling emergency services (9-1-1) are crucial for optimizing access to lifesaving emergency cardiac care and receipt of advanced treatments and improving survival. Five common symptoms of a heart attack are 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. If someone is suspected to be having a heart attack, 9-1-1 should be called immediately.

### Improving lung compliance by external compression of the chest wall [^f700c4b8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introductory background

The lung is encased by the chest wall, a multi-part structure comprised of the rib cage and abdomen. Considered independently, these interlocked components of the respiratory system have different innate mechanical properties. Quite apart from gravity, the local flexibility of the chest wall varies markedly from site to site; dorsal regions near the spine are inherently more rigid than those located more ventrally, and the rib cage is less flexible than the abdomen. Consequently, the diaphragmatic floor is normally the most pliable portion of the lung's thoracic enclosure, especially in the upright position. As discussed later, these regional variations of lung and chest wall properties provide possibilities for important therapeutic interventions. Even though we are constrained to directly set only one airway pressure, we can modify the amplitude and distribution of local forces surrounding the lungs by thoughtful attention to the chest wall.

### Role of communicating diagnostic uncertainty in the safety-netting process: insights from a vignette study [^c9c94685]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Details provided about the symptoms to be alert for and what actions to take

A minority of participants offered generic advice (simply advising the patient to return if they were worried/concerned); more commonly, participants gave specific clinical features for patients to act on. Participants often described the most important symptom to be alert for, although the level of detail provided varied greatly. For example, in the chest pain vignette some participants simply told the patient to reattend if chest pain returned:

[I]f you get the pain again then you're more than welcome to come back to hospital – 203

More commonly, participants provided some qualifying details (eg, being alert about the length of time the pain lasts or relevant associated symptoms).

[I]f you have severe chest pain lasting for more than ten minutes, with sweating and pain going to your arms… you should call an ambulance. – 309

A few participants gave much more detailed and specific advice, listing a range of situations when patients should return:

If you do develop any further chest pain that's lasting longer than five to ten minutes, if it's worrying you and certainly if there's any associated radiation of that chest pain to the neck, down the arms, sweating, breathlessness… then the action that you took today of calling 999 and coming straight to hospital is absolutely appropriate, and I would encourage you to do that again in the future. – 202

The variation in the level of detail provided was also seen in the CoBH and headache vignettes. Participants often explained the 'red flag' symptoms to look out for, but the exact clinical features and level of detail varied significantly: some participants only mentioned a few symptoms to be aware of, while others listed several. In the headache vignette, most participants mentioned additional symptoms to be vigilant about (eg, visual changes, weakness, photophobia, neck stiffness or vomiting), while some only discussed what to do if the headache itself persisted or worsened.

Initial evaluation — history for chest pain emphasizes that in patients with chest pain, a focused history that includes characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment should be obtained. A comprehensive history that captures all the characteristics of chest pain, including but not limited to its 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) location and radiation; 4) precipitating factors; 5) relieving factors; and 6) associated symptoms, can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients. The initial ECG is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease.

The trigger to get medical attention

The ultimate trigger to obtain medical attention could be internal (e.g. ineffectiveness of medication, duration of symptoms or impact on everyday life) or an external prompt from someone they knew.

The need for repeated medication with no accompanying improvement prompted some to seek help.

That night 6 [or] 8 times, each time I take 2 [salbutamol puffs]. So like every 2 hour That's why I go to Polyclinic in the morning.

(P12, 41/Malay/Male)

Some were triggered by the duration of troublesome symptoms.

I decide to go for the treatment. I feel like it's about more than two weeks already ah, been feeling the tightness of chest".

(P11, 24/Eurasian/Male)

The associated disturbance of sleep prompted some,

I suddenly woke up and start coughing a lot. It was affecting my sleep. So I got worried. So I just decided to come the next morning.

(P10, 28/Indian/Female)

while others were prompted to seek medical attention as their symptoms interfered with their ability to work.

I feel very pain [in] my chest ah. All very pain. I want to go work also I felt un-uncomfortable. So I come to uh polyclinic.

(P05, 58/Malay/Male)

The catalyst to seek help sometimes came from a partner, family member or friends who advised the patient to seek medical attention. This interaction could be coercive, or encouraging and helpful.

### Investigating the efficacy of chest pressure for direct current cardioversion in atrial fibrillation: a randomised control trial protocol (pressure-AF) [^56c70fed]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chest pressure is a simple intervention which may be effective in reducing cardioversion energy requirements and improving cardioversion success. A small randomised trial investigated chest pressure in cardioversion for AF and found reduced energy requirements and improved cardioversion success. This trial had a sample size of 100 patients and defibrillation energy started at 50 J. In our study, we aim to perform this multicentre study using guideline-directed energies (150 J)with adequately large sample size powered to definitively answer this important clinical question.

Consideration was made to quantify and standardise chest pressure provision during cardioversion in this trial. There were two main reasons why this was not pursued. First, one major benefit of chest pressure is its simplicity. External validity would be diminished if complex measures were taken to standardise chest pressure. Second, the degree of chest pressure is highly variable and depends on the body habitus of the patient. Having a 'one size fits all' approach to chest pressure provision is unlikely to be advantageous to the individual.

A theoretical concern is that of a shock being sustained by the proceduralist performing manual pressure. Despite this, a systematic review investigating bystander adverse events during defibrillation showed that events were uncommon and minor. At our centres, under controlled circumstances with trained staff, chest pressure has not been associated with adverse events to the proceduralist. This trial will provide quality data around the safety of manual chest pressure during defibrillation.

Improving success of direct current cardioversion in a reproducible, cost effective and safe manner has significant implications. First, it may assist in improving symptoms in patients who suffer with symptomatic arrhythmias. Second, we may be able to provide an energy threshold by which a large proportion of patients will be successfully cardioverted with a single shock and chest pressure. Third, there are indirect implications for defibrillation during advanced life support. Manual compression when providing defibrillation to refractory shockable rhythms may improve success of resuscitation.

In conclusion, Pressure-AF is an important clinical trial evaluating the simple intervention of chest pressure with potential to improve cardioversion success for AF.

### Identification and treatment of bronchoconstriction induced by a vagus nerve stimulator employed for management of seizure disorder [^f5d1ae06]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated a 63-year-old woman who developed dyspnea with a sensation of chest tightness that was temporally associated with discharges from a vagus nerve stimulator that had been implanted for the control of intractable seizures. Spirometry demonstrated the development of significant airflow obstruction associated with the firing of the stimulator. Adjustment of the stimulator settings resolved the discharge-associated bronchoconstrictive phenomenon. These findings highlight an important association between vagus nerve stimulators and dyspnea that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with these devices who present with dyspnea and/or chest tightness. The relative importance of vagal stimulation to bronchoconstriction is suggested by the findings.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### Asthma history and presentation [^be7f57a6]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is suspected from a history of key symptoms, including cough, wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and increased mucus production. A positive family or personal history of atopic diseases and diseases that are comorbid with asthma, such as allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, is also important. The differential diagnosis of asthma is broad and includes potentially life-threatening diseases. Pediatric asthma and psychiatric mimics require special attention to prevent misdiagnosis. Differentiating asthma from these other disease states by history alone is not always possible. Because accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment, objective testing by spirometry and methacholine challenge should be employed.

### Chest pain… [^98caba6b]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Chest pain can have many causes. Pain can come from the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, muscles and bones of the chest wall, or abnormalities in nerve pain sensation. It is often difficult to distinguish one type of chest pain from another. There are many tests that can be done to help distinguish the different types of chest pain so that the correct treatment can be given. Because heart disease continues to be a major cause of death and disability, chest pain due to disease of the coronary arteries is of particular concern. It is helpful to know the signs and symptoms that suggest cardiac chest pain. Cardiac chest pain is called angina, is due to blockages or dysfunction in the coronary blood vessels, and is usually related to physical exertion or stress.

Not everyone has the same symptoms, and women often have atypical symptoms compared with men. Risk factors for angina include high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure, and a family history of coronary artery disease. The April 8, 2009, issue of JAMA includes an article about cardiac causes of chest pain. Heart disease, including coronary artery disease or pericarditis Lung disease, including infections like pneumonia, pleurisy, pulmonary emboli to the lungs, and asthma Gastrointestinal reflux disease due to acidic stomach contents flowing upward into the esophagus that may cause heartburn or difficulty swallowing.

Musculoskeletal pain from the ribs or sternum and their attached muscles Abnormalities in cardiac nerve pain sensation Chest pain that usually occurs with or is made worse by physical exertion or stress Squeezing or pressure in the mid-chest region that may be associated with pain in the left arm or jaw. Chest pain associated with shortness of breath Chest pain associated with nausea, lightheadedness, or dizziness Fatigue or weakness occurring as a consequence of chest pain Electrocardiogram Chest x-ray Blood tests for evidence of heart muscle damage or emboli to the lungs Lung scan to detect any area with compromised airflow.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^a1d065e6]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology updated guidelines for management of chest pain, which are endorsed by five other cardiology groups. The guidelines provide new recommendations on what to consider chest pain and when to avoid testing in patients at low risk, and they endorse use of published decision pathways to determine the order and extent of workup. Initial Evaluation Chest pain can present as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw and less commonly as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue without pain. Chest pain is considered acute with new onset or if it involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration; it is considered stable if it is chronic with unchanging triggers such as exertion or emotional stress. Patients commonly describe ischemic chest pain as pressure, squeezing, heaviness, tightness, exertional, stress-related, or retrosternal.

Pain that is sharp, fleeting, pleuritic, positional, or shifting locations is less likely to be of cardiac origin. These guidelines suggest describing chest pain as cardiac; possible cardiac; or noncardiac. The descriptor atypical is no longer used because it can be interpreted by patients as being benign. Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing.

Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay. In patients with nonischemic causes of chest pain, gastrointestinal causes, depression, and anxiety should be considered. Up to one-fifth of people presenting with chest pain have a gastrointestinal cause. In patients with low-risk chest pain, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disease each exceed CAD by a factor of 10. Although mental health referrals are rare even when patients report anxiety, psychotherapy for these patients reduces chest pain frequency by one-third.

### Dynamic hyperinflation during bronchoconstriction in asthma: implications for symptom perception [^4e0b9844]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between respiratory symptom intensity and quality and dynamic lung hyperinflation (DH) during induced bronchoconstriction in asthma.

Patients and Methods

Subjects with asthma (n = 116) underwent baseline spirometry and lung volume measurement followed by high-dose methacholine challenge testing (MCT) [maximum decrease in FEV(1) of 50% from baseline]. Dyspnea intensity (Borg scale) was measured after each dose of methacholine. Qualitative descriptors of breathlessness and functional residual capacity (FRC) were measured at the doses nearest to the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV (PC(20)) and at the highest dose of methacholine (maximum response).

Results

FEV(1) decreased by 24.7 ± 0.7% (mean ± SEM) at the dose nearest to PC(20) and by 46.1 ± 1.1% at maximum response. Inspiratory capacity decreased by 0.62 ± 0.04 L at the dose nearest to PC(20) and 1.06 ± 0.06 L at maximum response. The descriptor clusters "inspiratory difficulty", "chest tightness", "unsatisfied inspiration", and "work" were selected at the dose nearest to PC(20) but were more frequently selected at maximum response (p < 0.0001). Individuals who reported chest tightness at maximum response had greater airflow obstruction and higher FRC (percentage of predicted) than those who did not report chest tightness.

Conclusions

Four dominant qualities of dyspnea in asthma (inspiratory difficulty, chest tightness, unsatisfied inspiration, and work) were reported early in the course of MCT and evolved in parallel, becoming more prevalent at maximum response. Significant DH accompanied even mild bronchoconstriction during MCT in asthma, making it difficult to separate mechanisms of chest tightness from other dominant respiratory sensations.

### Reliability and validity of the Chinese revised version of the pectus excavatum evaluation questionnaire in children with pectus excavatum [^0a50fb1a]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are various types of chest wall deformities, of which pectus excavatum(PE) and pectus carinatum(PC) are the two most common. Pectus excavatum is a funnel-shaped deformity formed when part of the sternum, ribs and costal cartilages are concave toward the spine. The sunken bones compress the lungs and heart in the chest cavity, thus limiting cardiorespiratory function, decreasing exercise endurance, and partially accompanied by chest pain and pressure sensation, limiting the patient's physical activity and decreasing the quality of life. The severity of chest wall deformity in children with PE tends to worsen during adolescence due to the significant physical and psychological changes that occur during this particular phase of body development. The majority of patients with PE experience significant body image concerns, leading to varying degrees of impact on their self-esteem and social life. Consequently, physicians are increasingly focusing on finding effective methods to assess the impact of PE on the lives of affected children.

### Patient with slow-growing mediastinal mass presents with chest pain and dyspnea [^bc064f3d]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old white woman presented with severe pain over the right upper abdomen and nonpleuritic, right-sided, lower chest-wall pain. Her pain had progressively gotten more frequent and severe over the last 5 months. It was also associated with a nonexertional, pressure-like sensation in the central chest. The patient denied any shortness of breath, fevers, cough, or any sputum production. She was taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and was a 30-pack-year current smoker; there was no history of drug abuse or occupational exposure. Previous chest radiographs dating back to 5 years consistently showed an elevated right-sided hemidiaphragm without any infiltrates or effusions; cardiomediastinal structures were unremarkable. She had not had a previous workup for these abnormal findings.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions reported coincident with the administration of DOPRAM (doxapram hydrochloride, USP) include:

1. Central and Autonomic Nervous Systems

Pyrexia, flushing, sweating; pruritus and paresthesia, such as a feeling of warmth, burning, or hot sensation, especially in the area of genitalia and perineum; apprehension, disorientation, pupillary dilatation, hallucinations, headache, dizziness, hyperactivity, involuntary movements, muscle spasticity, muscle fasciculations, increased deep tendon reflexes, clonus, bilateral Babinski, and convulsions.

2. Respiratory

Dyspnea, cough, hyperventilation, tachypnea, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hiccough, and rebound hypoventilation.

3. Cardiovascular

Phlebitis, variations in heart rate, lowered T-waves, arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), chest pain, tightness in chest. A mild to moderate increase in blood pressure is commonly noted and may be of concern in patients with severe cardiovascular diseases.

4. Gastrointestinal

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, desire to defecate.

5. Genitourinary

Stimulation of urinary bladder with spontaneous voiding; urinary retention. Elevation of BUN and albuminuria.

6. Hemic and Lymphatic

Hemolysis with rapid infusion. A decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count has been observed in postoperative patients. In the presence of pre-existing leukopenia, a further decrease in WBC has been observed following anesthesia and treatment with doxapram hydrochloride.

Open chest wounds — background and risk considerations emphasize pathophysiology and hazards of occlusive dressings. "An open chest wound (a wound through the chest wall and into the lung cavity) is immediately life-threatening". "The goal of a chest seal is to prevent air entry through the wound". "The greatest concern is the improper use of an occlusive dressing or device that could lead to fatal tension pneumothorax by preventing air from exiting through the chest wound". Furthermore, "It may be difficult for first aid providers to monitor for signs of tension pneumothorax such as decreased air movement on the affected side and low blood pressure".

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^38641b64]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

The dyspneic patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — pathophysiology linked to neural mechanisms is illustrated by a patient who is not dyspneic at rest but becomes dyspneic when walking; expiratory flow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation force the inspiratory muscles to operate at a shorter, disadvantageous sarcomere length, putting them at a mechanical disadvantage and increasing the amount of motor command required for a given ventilation. As exertion increases, ventilatory drive increases further and the desired tidal volume begins to approach inspiratory capacity, so the only way to increase minute ventilation is by increasing breathing frequency at the cost of greater deadspace ventilation and decreased dynamic compliance, leaving the patient unable to match ventilation to the prevailing respiratory drive. In this state, pulmonary stretch receptors, and perhaps chest wall proprioceptors, report this shortfall, and patients would likely use descriptors under inspiratory difficulty and unsatisfied inspiration, such as "Breathing in requires effort", "My breath does not go in all the way", "I feel a need for more air", or "I cannot get enough air in".

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Defining chest pain — recommendations (class of recommendation [COR] and level of evidence [LOE]) — include that an initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states that chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature; instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^20f781d8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration — mechanisms and modulators — is intensified by increased spontaneous ventilatory drive (hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, exercise-related drive) when ventilatory response is constrained, and occurs when corollary discharge of spontaneous respiratory motor drive to the cerebral cortex is not matched by adequate ventilatory response; in contrast, increased voluntary motor drive predominantly evokes respiratory effort that in healthy volunteers is not as unpleasant as air hunger. Mechanoreceptors in the lungs, airways, and chest wall can inhibit air hunger, with pulmonary stretch receptor activation alone producing prompt relief independent of vagal influences and blood gas changes, whereas evidence that chest wall mechanoreceptor feedback provides comparable relief is equivocal. Air hunger is not specific to disease or stimulus and has been reported in quadriplegic patients with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, decreased tidal volume, or mechanical challenge and also in normal subjects under neuromuscular blockade; patients with asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and idiopathic hyperventilation are significantly more likely than healthy control subjects to report air hunger when recalling breathing at the end of exercise, and across studies difficulty and discomfort during inspiration are greater than during expiration.

Work/effort sensation in dyspnea — experimental determinants and disease impact — can be produced by external resistive or elastic loads, by volitional hyperpnea, or by weakening the respiratory muscles via operating length changes, fatigue, or partial neuromuscular blockade, and with weakened respiratory muscles the motor command requirement increases and the perception of inspiratory effort and work is substantially magnified even without increased ventilation; breathing discomfort is much greater in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and frequently limits exercise.
