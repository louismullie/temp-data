## Question

E. coli antibiotic management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about E. coli antibiotic management across syndromes, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about syndrome classification and severity because management hinges on site and acuity. Then, I should verify resistance risk factors and local epidemiology to guide empiric choices. Next, I will review syndrome-specific management for STEC, UTIs, intra-abdominal infections, and bloodstream infections, including special populations. After that, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are integrated, including de-escalation and duration. Finally, I will consider emerging threats and summarize practical decision points with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: E. coli is a versatile pathogen, and optimal therapy depends on the clinical syndrome, illness severity, and local resistance patterns; I should not jump to conclusions before classifying the presentation into diarrheal illness (with concern for STEC), urinary tract infection (uncomplicated or complicated/pyelonephritis), intra-abdominal infection, or bloodstream infection, because each carries different risks and antibiotic strategies.

> Now, I need to check resistance risk factors that modify empiric choices: recent healthcare exposure, prior broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior colonization with resistant organisms, and travel to regions with high ESBL prevalence; I should double-check that these risks push me toward narrower agents when low risk and broader agents when high risk, always aligning with local antibiograms to avoid both undertreatment and overtreatment [^112nayjC] [^114UPXv9].

> For Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC), hold on, let's not jump to antibiotics; I should confirm that antibiotics are contraindicated because they increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome without proven benefit, so management is supportive with aggressive isotonic IV fluids and close monitoring for HUS, and I must avoid fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, TMP-SMX, and metronidazole if STEC is suspected or confirmed [^116kzmXH] [^116AFiJx] [^116MgTtt].

> For uncomplicated cystitis, let me think about first-line oral options with low resistance and minimal collateral damage; nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX where local resistance is under 20%, and fosfomycin are preferred, and I should verify that I avoid fluoroquinolones when resistance exceeds 20% locally and avoid amoxicillin-clavulanate given inferior cure rates and higher vaginal colonization; if ESBL-E is confirmed, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX remain preferred if susceptible, with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin as alternatives only when active [^111DJoMB] [^117PrQyC] [^113UcpBW].

> For complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, I should confirm severity first; if sepsis is present, I need prompt IV therapy and early source control, whereas stable patients may start with oral therapy if reliable absorption is expected; empiric choices include third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones based on local resistance and patient risk, reserving carbapenems for high ESBL risk or critical illness; I need to ensure timely IV-to-oral switch and total duration tailored to clinical response and source control, typically 7–14 days [^112xZtgT] [^117Vq6gK] [^114SRmeB].

> For ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI, wait, let me verify the preferred agents; carbapenems are preferred when resistance or toxicity precludes TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, with TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones acceptable if susceptible and the patient is stable; I should double-check that piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI despite in vitro susceptibility due to concerns for microbiologic failure, even though some data suggest noninferiority in cUTI; if I started piperacillin-tazobactam empirically and the patient is improving, I should consider switching to a preferred agent once susceptibilities return [^114SRmeB] [^113u3k1t] [^115SPMPY].

> For intra-abdominal infections, I will now examine empiric regimens by severity and risk; for low-risk community-acquired disease, a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole or a fluoroquinolone-based regimen can be reasonable if local fluoroquinolone resistance is low, whereas high-risk or healthcare-associated cases warrant broader coverage such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem; I should confirm that amoxicillin-clavulanate is not favored empirically due to rising resistance and limited contemporary evidence, and I must add antifungal coverage in select scenarios like recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak with poor response [^116bFM7y] [^111fkZbA] [^112Wcxye] [^112sgHoZ].

> For E. coli bloodstream infection, I need to ensure early appropriate therapy; in sepsis or septic shock, I should not delay broad-spectrum coverage, and for suspected ESBL-E, a carbapenem is preferred over piperacillin-tazobactam given the MERINO trial signal of higher mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam; once the patient stabilizes and oral options are active, I should de-escalate to TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone to complete therapy, and I should double-check duration based on source control and clinical response, typically 7–14 days [^115axtRo] [^114SRmeB] [^115rp3Xo].

> Special populations require tailored choices; in pregnancy, I should avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester and fluoroquinolones throughout, favoring beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or cephalosporins for pyelonephritis, and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent adverse obstetric outcomes; in pediatrics, I should confirm diagnosis with pyuria and at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen and treat febrile UTIs for 7–14 days; in neonates, I should cover for E. coli with ampicillin plus gentamicin for early-onset disease and broaden for late-onset disease, adding cefotaxime or cefepime if meningitis is suspected [^111cqEBQ] [^112s7Yvq] [^1162ZHDc].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is embedded at every step; that means obtaining cultures before antibiotics when feasible, reassessing at 48–72 hours to de-escalate based on susceptibilities, using the narrowest effective agent, and choosing the shortest effective duration; for uncomplicated cystitis, 5 days of nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX is usually sufficient, and for complicated infections, 7–14 days guided by clinical response is standard; I should double-check that stewardship programs improve appropriateness and reduce resistance without harming outcomes [^112bPvv4] [^111KF2gT] [^114NaTe7].

> Next, I should review emerging threats and resistance trends; ESBL and particularly CTX-M-15–producing E. coli are increasingly community-acquired, and fluoroquinolone resistance continues to rise, constraining empiric options; CRE remains uncommon but high-mortality, requiring last-line agents and strict infection control; pan-resistant E. coli would catastrophically increase sepsis mortality if effective therapy is unavailable, underscoring the urgency of surveillance, rapid diagnostics, and stewardship [^113AUQrZ] [^116dCdYy] [^114QFt4x] [^1159kQ62].

> Finally, let me reconsider practical decision points to ensure internal consistency: classify the syndrome and severity, screen for resistance risks, align empiric therapy with local antibiograms, avoid antibiotics in STEC, escalate promptly for sepsis, de-escalate with culture data, and use the narrowest effective agent for the shortest effective duration; I should confirm that these steps align with IDSA guidance and contemporary resistance data to balance individual patient benefit with societal resistance containment [^116kzmXH] [^114SRmeB] [^116dCdYy].

Effective E. coli management requires **syndrome-specific therapy** and **stewardship** to balance timely empiric coverage with resistance risk [^111KF2gT]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin guided by local resistance; avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist [^111DJoMB]. For complicated UTI/pyelonephritis, use ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones, or piperacillin-tazobactam, escalating to carbapenems if ESBL risk is high; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-E bloodstream infections [^115rp3Xo] [^114SRmeB]. For STEC, do not give antibiotics due to HUS risk [^116kzmXH]. For sepsis, start broad-spectrum therapy promptly, then de-escalate to culture results; for asymptomatic bacteriuria, do not treat except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^115axtRo] [^113fEjAS]. Always obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible and tailor therapy to susceptibilities to limit resistance and adverse effects [^112bPvv4].

## Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI)

### First-line antibiotic therapy

- **Nitrofurantoin**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days; avoid in CrCl < 30 mL/min.
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: 160/800 mg orally twice daily for 3 days; use only if local resistance ≤ 20% [^112ZuMBn].
- **Fosfomycin**: 3 g orally as a single dose; alternative option.

---

### Alternative antibiotic therapy

Alternative options include **beta-lactams** (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefdinir) for 5–7 days when first-line agents are unsuitable, and **fluoroquinolones** (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) for 3 days only when no alternatives are available due to resistance and adverse effects [^112ZuMBn].

---

## Complicated UTI and pyelonephritis

### Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **severity and local resistance**:

- **Ceftriaxone**: 1–2 g IV every 24 hours.
- **Fluoroquinolones**: ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg IV/PO daily.
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam**: 4.5 g IV every 6–8 hours.
- **Carbapenems**: ertapenem 1 g IV daily or meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours if ESBL risk is high [^115rp3Xo].

---

### Definitive antibiotic therapy

Tailor to **culture results and susceptibilities**, with **duration** of 7–14 days depending on clinical response and complications [^112bPvv4].

---

## Antibiotic resistance considerations

- **ESBL-producing E. coli**: Carbapenems are first-line for severe infections; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-E bloodstream infections [^115rp3Xo].
- **Carbapenem-resistant E. coli**: Use last-resort agents (e.g. ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam) per susceptibility and local guidelines [^notfound].
- **Local antibiograms**: Essential for empiric selection and stewardship [^116uTTsD].

---

## Special clinical scenarios

### Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)

For STEC, **management** is supportive care with hydration; antibiotics are contraindicated due to increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^111cm1bz].

---

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria

For asymptomatic bacteriuria, **management** is to avoid treatment except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures to prevent unnecessary resistance and adverse effects [^113fEjAS].

---

### Sepsis and severe infections

For sepsis and severe infections, **management** is to start broad-spectrum therapy promptly, then de-escalate to culture results to balance timely coverage with stewardship [^115axtRo].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- **Untreated E. coli infections**: Can progress to sepsis, renal scarring, and chronic kidney disease.
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Associated with increased mortality, length of stay, and healthcare costs [^114wrRTy].
- **Adverse effects**: Include C. difficile infection, nephrotoxicity, and allergic reactions.

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

IDSA guidelines emphasize **culture-directed therapy**, **narrow-spectrum agents**, and **stewardship** to limit resistance [^111DJoMB]. ESCMID guidelines similarly prioritize **local resistance data** and **patient-specific factors** to guide empiric therapy.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

New **beta-lactamase inhibitors** (e.g. ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam) expand options for resistant E. coli [^notfound]. Rapid diagnostics enable earlier detection of resistance genes to support targeted therapy, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are critical to curb resistance and improve outcomes [^116EGDKh].

---

Effective E. coli management hinges on **syndrome-specific therapy**, **local resistance data**, and **stewardship** to optimize outcomes and limit resistance.

## References

### Treatment of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^111cm1bz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The management of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections is reviewed. Certain management practices optimize the likelihood of good outcomes, such as avoidance of antibiotics during the pre-hemolytic uremic syndrome phase, admission to hospital, and vigorous intravenous volume expansion using isotonic fluids. The successful management of STEC infections is based on recognition that a patient might have an STEC infection, and appropriate use of the microbiology laboratory. The timeliness of STEC identification cannot be overemphasized, because it avoids therapies prompted by inappropriate additional testing and directs the clinician to focus on effective management strategies. The opportunities during STEC infections to avert the worst outcomes are brief, and this article emphasizes practical matters relevant to making a diagnosis, anticipating the trajectory of illness, and optimizing care.

### Why antibiotics should not be used to treat Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^116MgTtt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been much debate about treating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections with antibiotics. No data convincingly demonstrate that antibiotics are better than no antibiotic treatment at all, and many studies suggest antibiotics increase the risk of developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This topic is timely, because emerging technology enables rapid identification of STEC-infected patients, and we anticipate questions about management will increase. This review is designed to familiarize readers with the series of observations that underlie our recommendations.

Recent Findings

The long debate over antibiotics in STEC infections appears resolved by gradually accruing information that show that antibiotics do not benefit infected patients. In fact, they are associated with an increased likelihood of developing HUS. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that low risk of bias studies find a clear association between antibiotic use and development of HUS. Subsequent publications do not refute these findings.

Summary

In high-income countries, antibiotics should not routinely be given to patients with acute diarrhea unless testing demonstrates a pathogen for which antibiotics are indicated, and STEC infection has been excluded. Future work to prevent HUS should focus on preventing primary infections, and mitigating extraintestinal consequences of STEC gut infections.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) treatment risks — treatment of STEC O157 and likely non-O157 STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 with fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, TMP-SMX, and metronidazole in patients of all ages should be avoided because of evidence of harm; very limited data on macrolide antibiotics provide insufficient evidence of benefit and some evidence for harm favoring avoidance, and because the Shiga toxin profile is often unknown and no clear benefit exists for treating less virulent STEC infections with antibiotics, avoidance of antimicrobials is recommended among people with suspected STEC infections.

### Management of serious nosocomial bacterial infections: do current therapeutic options meet the need? [^113A1zGS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired bacterial infections pose a formidable challenge for healthcare providers, as patients often need to be treated empirically, at least initially, although delay of appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is known to increase morbidity significantly and to increase mortality among affected patients. This elevated risk is compounded by the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prompt initiation of treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms is prudent for patients with nosocomial infections. As the continued usefulness of vancomycin comes into question, the number of alternative agents that provide efficacy equal to that of vancomycin remains limited. The development of novel and effective alternative agents, such as tigecycline, is therefore important.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^114akPFB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^115dApDE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria, most often Escherichia coli, from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in women with uncomplicated infection; antibiotic treatments in women admitted to hospital with complicated infection; inpatient versus outpatient management in women with uncomplicated infection; analgesia in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 5 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, inpatient management, intravenous antibiotics, non-opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antibiotics, outpatient management, urinary analgesics.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) — antimicrobial therapy for infections attributed to STEC O157 and other STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 (or if the toxin genotype is unknown) should be avoided (strong, moderate), whereas antimicrobial therapy for infections attributed to other STEC that do not produce Shiga toxin 2 (generally non-O157 STEC) is debatable due to insufficient evidence of benefit or the potential harm associated with some classes of antimicrobial agents (strong, low).

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^1129xunM]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is increasingly becoming a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. To date, the treatment for serious CRE infections remains difficult. The intelligent use of antimicrobials and effective infection control strategies is crucial to prevent further CRE spread. Early consultation with experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms is valuable in patient management. This brief review will focus on the current, yet limited, treatment options for CRE infections.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159bwqx]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months. Most of the contributing studies, however, were conducted in adults.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infectionsand is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^114tziMq]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Fluoroquinolones and fluoroquinolone-based regimens — moxifloxacin use is limited by local resistance: Use moxifloxacin for empiric therapy of lower-risk adults, but use caution in areas where there is a high incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (Grade 1-A).

---

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^116bFM7y]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole for lower-risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI): We recommend ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for the empiric treatment of lower-risk adults with CA-IAI. Based on all data, the task force concludes that ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole is a reasonable option for the treatment of lower-risk patients with CA-IAI, and in geographic localities with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, a non-fluoroquinolone-based regimen would be preferable.

### Predicting sepsis mortality into an era of pandrug-resistant E. coli through modeling [^1159kQ62]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Under the assumptions of our models, the predicted impact of pan-resistant E. coli strains on sepsis deaths is extreme. Yet even our worst-case model ignores the likelihood that a pan-resistant E. coli strain will likely accelerate the current rate of increase in sepsis incidence. Currently, 2–5% of untreated cystitis cases progress to sepsis –. Without effective antibiotics, many more bladder infections will go essentially untreated, presumably increasing sepsis incidence and further elevating the rapid increase in sepsis deaths predicted by our models.

Paradoxically, even as sepsis incidence has risen in the U.S. sepsis case mortality rate has declined. Improvements in sepsis awareness, detection, and management may all contribute to this pattern. For instance, efforts to detect sepsis earlier in its course, in milder forms, and in patients with other primary acute conditions have contributed to the apparent rise in sepsis incidence. Other suspected contributors to rising sepsis rates include increasing rates of invasive procedures, growing numbers of immune-suppressed individuals, and emergence and expansion of more virulent E. coli lineages. At the same time, increased sepsis awareness, early detection, and improved treatment regimens have decreased sepsis case mortality rates. However, our findings suggest that the emergence of pan-resistant E. coli strains could undermine these advances. Specifically, we predict a sharp rise in sepsis deaths if pan-resistant E. coli infections eliminate the option of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^115axtRo]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The randomized prospective MERINO trial, that compared therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem in patients with severe bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumonia e, supported early appropriate therapy. Non-inferiority of the piperacillin-tazobactam arm could not be established with 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam dying at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 patients (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6%).

Delayed administration of appropriate therapy can be due to both delays in recognition of infection and administration of the antibiotics, but the optimal timing of therapy depends on the population studied. A recent review suggested that a reasonable timeframe would be no later than three to five hours after infection onset, but immediately for patients with septic shock. The administration of early appropriate therapy must be balanced against the unnecessary use of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum agents, in the absence of proven infection, with excess mortality associated with this practice, and an increased risk of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Thus, the use of rapid, broad-spectrum empiric therapy, especially in emergency settings, must come with a commitment to de-escalation, meaning shorter duration, less broad-spectrum therapy and fewer drugs, once clinical and microbiologic data become available (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The need for immediate broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy for selected patients with severe sepsis may be life-saving, but may also put pressure to overuse antibiotics and drive antibiotic resistance. Thus, this approach comes with the obligation to try to control resistance by de-escalating therapy once serial clinical, microbiologic and laboratory data become available. De-escalation can be in the form of shorter duration of therapy, less broad-spectrum agents, fewer drugs, or a combination of these interventions

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^111GXF2V]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in the older patient population, and Escherichia coli is the most common uropathogen in community dwelling people older than 65 years. The spectrum of UTI ranges from a mild self limiting illness to severe sepsis, with a mortality rate of 20–40%. The incidence of sepsis and its associated mortality increases disproportionately with age, and UTI in men is more likely to be severe. Both sexes develop UTI in old age, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 in patients older than 70 years, compared with the overwhelming UTI susceptibility of females in younger populations, with a 50:1 ratio. The diagnosis of UTI in older patients can be problematic, as these patients are less likely to present with a typical clinical history and localised urinary symptoms compared with younger patients. The rising incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults is also contributing to further diagnostic difficulty (> 20% of women aged ≥ 65 years compared with < 5% in younger women), which results in probable over-diagnosis of UTI and unnecessary treatment.

UTI is the second most common diagnosis for which empirical antibiotics are prescribed in both primary and secondary care, with more than 50% of the antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI in older adults being considered unnecessary. With the spread of antibiotic resistance and its increasing threat to public health (about 30% of urinary isolates of E coli are now resistant to trimethoprim), national guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been proposed to combat these challenges.NHS England, for example, released the Quality Premium to incentivise Clinical Commissioning Groups to reduce antibiotic use in primary care. As a result of these new initiatives, a substantial decrease in antibiotic use has been reported for the first time in England across the whole healthcare system between 2013 and 2017. A recent study has also shown a decrease in prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics for UTI in older people in primary care between 2004 and 2014. In the meantime, however, increases in the incidence of Gram negative bloodstream infections have been reported, which has led the UK government to announce a plan to reduce healthcare associated Gram negative bloodstream infections in England by 50% by March 2021.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^111fkZbA]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Fluoroquinolone monotherapy (moxifloxacin) for community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI): We recommend moxifloxacin as an acceptable agent for the empiric treatment of lower-risk adults with CA-IAI, although it should be used with caution in areas of the world where there is a high incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (Grade 1-A). We do not recommend the use of moxifloxacin for empiric treatment of children with IAI unless no other options are available (Grade 1-C).

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^112nayjC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: is age alone a marker of complication? [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

Conclusions

The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective for appropriately selected older women. Prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to management.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### Desirability of outcome ranking for the management of antimicrobial therapy (DOOR MAT) reveals improvements in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients from the veterans health administration [^114NaTe7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reductions in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a cornerstone of antimicrobial stewardship. We aim to demonstrate use of the Desirability of Outcome Ranking Approach for the Management of Antimicrobial Therapy (DOOR MAT) to evaluate the treatment of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections in patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) across a decade.

Methods

Using electronic records, we determined empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments, clinical characteristics, and 30-day mortality of patients with monomicrobial E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections hospitalized in VHA medical centers from 2009 to 2018. Focusing on patients treated with parenteral β-lactams and with available antibiotic susceptibility testing results, we applied a range of DOOR MAT scores that reflect the desirability of antibiotic choices according to spectrum and activity against individual isolates. We report trends in resistance and desirability of empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments.

Results

During the 10-year period analyzed, resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones increased in E. coli but not in K. pneumoniae, while resistance to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam remained unchanged. In 6451 cases analyzed, we observed improvements in DOOR MAT scores consistent with deescalation. Improvement in desirability of definitive treatment compared with empiric treatment occurred in 26% of cases, increasing from 16% in 2009 to 34% in 2018. Reductions in overtreatment were sustained and without negative impact on survival.

Conclusions

DOOR MAT provides a framework to assess antibiotic treatment of E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections and can be a useful metric in antimicrobial stewardship.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^113fmdam]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

It's not an unusual presentation in primary care — an alert, responsive preschool child with a temperature of 39°C, unremarkable findings on examination, but with leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. Given a strong suspicion of a urinary tract infection, and with Escherichia coli being the most likely organism, empirical management with one of a small number of cheap and available antibiotics would follow.

In a linked paper, Bryce and colleagues (doi:) present compelling evidence of the need to reconsider current approaches to community based management of paediatric urinary tract infection. Their findings confront long established patterns of practice and are inextricably linked to the emerging global problem of antimicrobial resistance.

Bryce's team undertook a systematic review designed to identify the global prevalence of resistance to commonly recommended antibiotics in children with community acquired E coli urinary tract infection. They systematically reviewed 58 studies in 26 countries. Five of these studies allowed them to measure the association between previous prescription of antibiotics and subsequent E coli resistance in the same child. Drugs of interest included ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. Ceftazidime was used as a marker for cephalosporin resistance.

For an antibiotic to be considered a first line empirical treatment for urinary tract infection, resistance should not exceed 20% in the most likely infecting strain. Bryce and colleagues show that this threshold has been reached for many first line antibiotics used for paediatric E coli urinary tract infection. Within countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), a half of all isolates were resistant to ampicillin, a third to co-trimoxazole, and a quarter to trimethoprim. Resistance was substantially greater in non-OECD countries. Data confirmed the group's previous reviewsuggesting that previous antibiotic use in primary care increased the subsequent risk of E coli resistance to that particular antibiotic.

Despite the clinical mixed inclusion criteria (a women aged 17 with symptoms of cystitis presents a very different clinical picture than a toddler with a fever of unknown origin), the findings have important implications for the management of paediatric urinary tract infection in primary care and for clinical decisions that have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid — empiric therapy considerations for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): The literature search did not identify any RCTs published since 2000 evaluating this agent, and a small prospective trial comparing IV amoxicillin–clavulanic acid plus metronidazole versus IV ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole found lower success rates with the amoxicillin–clavulanic acid regimen, although not statistically significant. An observational study from The Netherlands reported amoxicillin–clavulanic acid-resistant E. coli was increasingly common and use of this agent in such patients was associated with increased death. Susceptibility of E. coli to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was 50%–51%, only marginally better than ampicillin–sulbactam (45%–47%). Because of these efficacy and resistance concerns and lack of recent RCTs, the task force does not support use of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for empiric treatment of patients with IAI; IV preparation is not available in the United States.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111opq5j]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic stewardship and culture-directed management emphasizes that culture-directed, not empiric, therapies are associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic use, and that obtaining cultures for each symptomatic episode is associated with reduced rates of overtreatment and more appropriate antibiotic selection. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, risk of continued rUTIs as well as progression to later pyelonephritis is enhanced by unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria without any demonstrable benefit, and collateral damage from antimicrobial therapy includes alterations of the normal gut microbiome and promotion of multidrug resistant organisms. Escherichia coli isolates continue to demonstrate high in vitro susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and mecillinam, with these agents having minimal effects on the normal fecal microbiota, whereas TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones promote increased rates of antimicrobial resistance. Continued intermittent courses of antibiotics in rUTI patients are associated with significant adverse events, particularly in older adults, and thus substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of an acute cystitis episode. In asymptomatic women with a history of rUTIs, a placebo-controlled trial found those treated for ASB were more likely to have additional symptomatic cystitis episodes in a year of follow-up than those randomized to placebo, and over two years of follow up, treatment aimed at eradicating residual bacteriuria was associated with a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a higher incidence of pyelonephritis, and a poorer quality of life compared to non-treatment.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) with impaired voiding — asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) management: Recommendation — In patients with SCI, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary highlights that subjects with SCI have a high prevalence of bacteriuria and a high incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and treatment of ASB is usually followed by early recurrence of bacteriuria with reinfecting strains more likely to be antimicrobial resistant. Trials in intermittently catheterized patients observed no differences in rates of symptomatic UTI between antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment. Multiple reviews and guidelines concluded that ASB should not be screened for or treated in SCI patients, and European Association of Urology guidance states screening for and treatment of ASB are not recommended. Some evidence suggests ASB might be protective and that treatment of ASB may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI; bacterial interference using nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli 83972/HU2117) has been evaluated, with two RCTs in neurogenic bladders reporting protection against symptomatic UTI in small cohorts (20 and 27 patients, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms of UTI in SCI may differ from the classic genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with normal sensation.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^116EGDKh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy

Empirical antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role in the effective management of IAIs; as inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with less favourable patient outcomes and the emergence of AMR, it is crucial to prescribe antibiotics correctly, with the right spectrum of activity, at the right time, for the right duration and with the right dosage. Optimizing antibiotic prescribing in the hospital setting results in improved treatment effectiveness and patient safety. This minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection and mitigates the risk of selecting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The growing emergence of MDR organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, particularly concerning Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial treatment should be started when a treatable infection has been recognized or strongly suspected. Misuse and abuse of antimicrobial agents, combined with the inappropriate application of infection prevention and control measures, are recognized as major drivers of the increasing prevalence of AMR.

AMR has become a global threat to public health systems in recent decades. Italy is ranked among the lowest-performing countries in AMR control in Europe by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), primarily due to alarmingly high levels of AMR observed in Italian hospitals. In January 2017 a team of experts in antimicrobial stewardship selected by the ECDC planned a four-day visit to Italy to investigate and evaluate the situation in the country regarding prevention and control of AMR. In the report drafted by the ECDC Committee, the experts highlighted the threat represented by the AMR, and the crucial necessity to design a national plan of action to address this burden.

In 2022, the ECDC published an interesting document evaluating the health impact of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA. The report, covering the period from 2016 to 2020, showed that the overall burden of infections attributed to AMR pathogens, adjusted for population size, was highest in Greece, Italy, and Romania. In Italy, an alarming pattern of resistance involving MDR and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has emerged in recent years, and multi-resistant Enterobacterales are now a major concern in daily clinical practice. This phenomenon may be partially attributed to a high average age of the population, predisposing to the development and spread of AMR. However, it is likely to be influenced by a poor perception of the AMR burden. Hence, there is a critical need to raise awareness among Italian healthcare workers regarding the importance of the management of infections, including IAIs.

### Neonatal Escherichia coli bloodstream infections: clinical outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic therapy [^112U1bdX]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Escherichia coli is a common cause of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in infants and is associated with high mortality and morbidity among survivors. The clinical significance of antibiotic resistance and timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in this population is poorly understood.

Methods

We identified all infants with E. coli BSIs discharged from 77 neonatal intensive care units managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group in 2012. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between 30-day mortality and ampicillin-resistant E. coli BSI, as well as the number of active empiric antimicrobial agents administered, controlling for gestational age, small-for-gestational age status, early-onset versus late-onset BSI, oxygen requirement, ventilator support and inotropic support on the day of the first positive blood culture.

Results

We identified 258 episodes of E. coli BSI, including 123 (48%) ampicillin-resistant isolates. Unadjusted 30-day mortality did not significantly differ between infants with ampicillin-resistant versus ampicillin-susceptible E. coli BSI [11 of 123 (9%) vs. 7 of 135 (5%); P = 0.33; adjusted odds ratio = 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 4.77)]. Among ampicillin-resistant E. coli BSIs, 30-day mortality was not significantly lower for infants treated with at least one empiric antimicrobial active against ampicillin-resistant E. coli versus infants receiving no active empiric agent [adjusted odds ratio = 1.50 (0.07, 33.6)].

Conclusions

In this population of infants with E. coli BSI, ampicillin resistance was not associated with significantly increased mortality. Among the subset of infants with ampicillin-resistant E. coli, appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower mortality.

### Endemic and epidemic lineages of Escherichia coli that cause urinary tract infections [^113LNGAa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired extraintestinal infections with Escherichia coli range in frequency from 6 to 8 million cases of uncomplicated cystitis per year to 127,500 cases of sepsis per year in the United States. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by E. coli are one of the most common extraintestinal infections in women and, because of their high incidence, are the focus of most epidemiologic studies. The source of E. coli for these infections is a person's intestinal tract; however, how these E. coli are acquired by the gut is unclear. Risk factors that lead to intestinal colonization with extraintestinal E. coli differ from factors associated with development of infection.

Young, otherwise healthy, sexually active women have the highest risk for community-acquired UTIs. The main risk factors for UTI are recent and frequent sexual intercourse, contraceptive use, and a history of UTIs. Treatment for UTIs usually involves a short course of an antimicrobial drug, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). Over the past decade, the prevalence of drug resistance in E. coli has increased dramatically, complicating management of these infections. Across the United States and Canada, urinary tract isolates of E. coli from outpatient clinics showed increased resistance to TMP-SMZ and ampicillin. A more serious concern has been the gradual increase in fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) resistance among UTI isolates.

### Medical and economic impact of extraintestinal infections due to Escherichia coli: focus on an increasingly important endemic problem [^1179jzVg]. Microbes and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is probably the best-known bacterial species and one of the most frequently isolated organisms from clinical specimens. Despite this, underappreciation and misunderstandings exist among medical professionals and the lay public alike regarding E. coli as an extraintestinal pathogen. Underappreciated features include (i) the wide variety of extraintestinal infections E. coli can cause, (ii) the high incidence and associated morbidity, mortality, and costs of these diverse clinical syndromes, (iii) the pathogenic potential of different groups of E. coli strains for causing intestinal versus extraintestinal disease, and (iv) increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated "killers". Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli. New treatments and prevention measures will be needed for improved outcomes and a diminished disease burden.

### Setting the standard: multidisciplinary hallmarks for structural, equitable and tracked antibiotic policy [^115VQW6Y]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

How to develop meaningful key performance indicators?

While uncertainty remains about the degree to which interventions will be effective, reducing the overall amount of antibiotics used in health and animal and plant production systems is a key component of most AMR action plans. Over the past two decades, international bodies have attempted to decide which antibiotics to protect from overuse. Since 2004, WHO, OIE and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have begun using the categories of critically important antimicrobials (CIAs), highly important antimicrobials and important antimicrobials — although differences in the categorisation of the same drugs for veterinary and medical usages can remain. In 2019, the WHO's Essential Medicines List added the AWaRe categorisation, to meet a need to recognise those medicines that should be Accessed as first-line narrow-spectrum treatment for particular conditions, and those with higher risks of becoming resistant that should be used Watchfully and those that should be Reserved for last-line treatment. This framework can be used as an index — the ratio of Access to Watch and Reserve medicines — to compare prescribing practices in different contexts, which goes some way to balancing the different challenges of improving access and restricting excess when setting targets. However, measurement of antibiotic usage remains a challenge. Although WHO and OIE have standardised methodologies to collect country-level antimicrobial usage in humans and animals for global reporting and consulting companies like IQVIA gather and sell additional proprietary data, more granular level detail about antibiotic usage on farms and in particular clinical and residential settings is required for targeted reduction strategies.

Alongside improved usage data, deciding which microbes, resistance genes and AMR reservoirs to monitor in medical, animal and plant production, and environmental settings is similarly important for the formulation of meaningful policy interventions. For humans, WHO published a list of priority pathogens to monitor and target with antibiotic development efforts in 2017. For animals, the OIE Member Countries agreed on harmonised lists for both terrestrial and aquatic animals. However, it remains difficult to prioritise which sentinel organisms to survey and where potentially important AMR reservoirs are located due to different health threats in HICs, MICs and LICs, lacking clinical surveillance infrastructure in many LMICs and of environmental surveillance in the most countries, regionally skewed reporting that often centres on urban clinical settings, and limited diagnostic capabilities for non-classic pathogens. Furthermore, particular microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli may or may not be causing disease, and therefore, their measurement without corresponding disease burden data might be misleading.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^111QdpPd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in outpatients and result in substantial morbidity and healthcare costs. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the primary causal agent of UTIs. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing practices, such as the overuse of broad-spectrum agents, have contributed to the rise of antimicrobial resistance making effective treatment more challenging. The increasing resistance of uropathogens to commonly prescribed antibiotics necessitates a shift towards alternatives with a narrower spectrum and lower regional resistance rates, such as nitrofurantoin. Since empiric antibiotic recommendations are guided by local resistance rates, audit and feedback (AF) interventions have gained attention as a strategy to address regional knowledge gaps and support clinician behavioural change.

In a systematic review of physician-targeted interventions for the management of UTIs, small trials of written and in-person AF, sometimes paired with education, show promise; however, the largest trial which involved in-person workshops had an almost 50% opt-out rate did not improve antibiotic selection statistically and faced barriers in spread. None of these trials included individualised feedback with local or regional comparisons. Peer comparison AF interventions have shown promise in improving healthcare provider performance and enhancing guideline adherence. In the context of encouraging family physicians (FPs) to prescribe nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for uncomplicated lower UTIs, a mail-based programme of personalised prescribing AF comparing an individual physician's practice with their peers coupled with educational summaries (ESs), may offer a valuable strategy to improve appropriate antibiotic use. Because receiving AF multiple times is more effective than one instance and there remains uncertainty as to which measures could improve the durability of the effect of AF, we sought to test one form of repeated intervention. We present an evaluation of a cluster-randomised trial that explores the impact of permutations of mailing AF including peer-comparison and an ES promoting the appropriate use of nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for UTIs.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^115XEKrr]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### The expanding role of fluoroquinolones [^111SR2jC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing rate of resistance among common urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to traditional antimicrobial therapies including the "gold standard" trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Consequently, fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have taken on an expanding management role for UTIs. In fact, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical management guidelines for UTI recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in areas where resistance is likely to be of concern. Fluoroquinolones have demonstrated high bacteriologic and clinical cure rates, as well as low rates of resistance, among most common uropathogens. There are currently 7 fluoroquinolones with indications for UTI in the United States. However, only 3 are commonly used: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, gatifloxacin. Many of the fluoroquinolone agents have once-daily dosing regimens, enhancing patient adherence. In addition, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have same-dose bioequivalency between their intravenous and oral formulations, allowing for "switch" or step-down therapy from parenteral to oral formulations of the same agent at the same dose. Fluoroquinolones are indicated for the management of acute uncomplicated UTIs, as well as complicated and severe UTI and pyelonephritis, in adults. They are the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or TMP, who live in geographic areas with known resistance > 10% to 20% to TMP-SMX, or who have risk factors for such resistance. Fluoroquinolone properties include a broad spectrum of coverage, low rates of resistance, and good safety profiles.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^113u3k1t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112VtasZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

E. coli O157:H7 can cause potentially lethal illness in hosts of all ages. These patients often are evaluated and treated by gastroenterologists. The treating physician should administer adequate hydration, usually parenterally, and avoid the use of antibiotics and antimotility agents. The physician needs to notify immediately the appropriate public health authorities of the diagnosis and to ensure that the isolate is recovered by the microbiologist and forwarded for molecular linkage analyses.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115mC5vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

### Consensus review of the epidemiology and appropriate antimicrobial therapy of complicated urinary tract infections in Asia-Pacific region [^1127rChk]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the general population. They cause a substantial financial burden in the community and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitals. With increased rates of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, treatment of complicated UTIs (cUTIs) can be challenging for clinicians. Consideration of an optimal antimicrobial agent should be based on local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, and cost. In the Asia-Pacific region, nearly half of Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant (including intermediate and resistant) to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and ≥ 30% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) and cefepime. Overall, 33% of urinary E. coli isolates exhibited extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing phenotypes. Prevalence of ESBL-producing urinary E. coli was highest in India (60%), followed by Hong Kong (48%) and Singapore (33%). All urinary isolates of E. coli were susceptible to both ertapenem and imipenem. All urinary isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem and 4% of them were resistant to ertapenem. Care should be exercised when using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins for the empirical treatment of UTIs, particularly cUTI among moderately to severely ill patients. Empiric antimicrobial treatment for serious cUTIs in which risk factors for resistant organisms exist should include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam. Aminoglycosides, tigecycline, and polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) can be used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms or serious cUTIs when first-line options are deemed inappropriate or patients fail therapy. Because of considerable variability in different countries, local epidemiological data is critical in the effective management of UTIs in the Asia-Pacific region.

### The role of antimicrobial management programs in optimizing antibiotic prescribing within hospitals [^111KF2gT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Managing serious infections is a balance between providing timely and appropriate broad-spectrum empirical therapy for individual patients, which has been consistently shown to improve outcomes, and reducing unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents, which may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. To control the spread of antimicrobial resistance, hospitals commonly implement programs designed to optimize antimicrobial use, supported by infection-control measures. Hospital-based antimicrobial management programs — also called "antimicrobial stewardship programs" — are primarily based on education coupled with a "front-end" approach (i.e., restricting the availability of selected antimicrobial agents) or a "back-end" approach (i.e., reviewing broad-spectrum empirical therapy and then streamlining or discontinuing therapy, as indicated, on the basis of culture and susceptibility testing results and clinical response). Institutional efforts to optimize antimicrobial use should concentrate on patient outcomes, should have multidisciplinary support, and should use a combination of interventions customized to the needs, resources, and information technology infrastructure of the health care institution.

### Antimicrobial resistance and mortality followingbacteremia [^114wrRTy]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

E. coli bloodstream infections are associated with a high 90 day mortality rate, and the crude mortality is significantly higher for strains resistant to each class of common antimicrobial agents. Some of the current elevated mortality with AMR E. coli is explained by patient characteristics, and in particular confounding by extent of prior healthcare exposure. Therefore many estimates of the current mortality associated with AMR may be over-estimates, and ongoing surveillance for AMR-associated mortality should incorporate adjustment for patient characteristics. However, our data detected strong signals of associated increased mortality with AMR, even after multivariable adjustment. The association was strongest for the most important empiric and therapeutic classes of agents, and so future estimates will also need to take into account antibiotic availability and treatment practices in different regions. Ongoing global and local efforts are essential to help curtail AMR, and thereby minimize mortality among patients with E. coli bloodstream infection and other common bacterial pathogens and syndromes.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^115269oF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions. The most current version of the guidance including the date of publication can be found at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^112s7Yvq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 3 (criteria to establish UTI): To establish the diagnosis of UTI, clinicians should require both urinalysis results that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter of a uropathogen cultured from a urine specimen obtained through transurethral catheterization or SPA (evidence quality: C; recommendation). The comment emphasizes that the diagnosis of UTI in febrile infants is signaled by the presence of both bacteriuria and pyuria, that pyuria without bacteriuria is insufficient to make a diagnosis of UTI, and that bacteriuria without pyuria is attributable to contamination, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or very early infection; non-Escherichia coli isolates are less frequently associated with pyuria than E coli and non-E coli uropathogens are of concern because they are more likely to result in scarring than E coli, although animal studies indicate host inflammatory response drives scarring and the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria can account for the lack of association with pyuria.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients with positive blood cultures: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1169L3s5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic management in patients with positive blood cultures is safe remains understudied. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to investigate effects of PCT-guided antibiotic management in patients with bacteremia.

Methods

We extracted and analyzed individual data of 523 patients with positive blood cultures included in 13 trials, in which patients were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics based on PCT levels (PCT group) or a control group. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of antibiotic treatment. The main safety endpoint was mortality within 30 days.

Results

Mean duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter for 253 patients who received PCT-guided treatment than for 270 control patients (-2.86 days [95% confidence interval, -4.88 to -.84]; p = 0.006). Mortality was similar in both arms (16.6% vs 20.0%; p = 0.263). In subgroup analyses by type of pathogen, we noted a trend of shorter mean antibiotic durations in the PCT arm for patients infected with gram-positive organisms or Escherichia coli and significantly shorter treatment for subjects with pneumococcal bacteremia. In analysis by site of infection, antibiotic exposure was shortened in PCT subjects with Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and those with E. coli urogenital infections.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of patients with bacteremia receiving PCT-guided antibiotic management demonstrates lower antibiotic exposure without an apparent increase in mortality. Few differences were demonstrated in subgroup analysis stratified by type or site of infection but notable for decreased exposure in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and E. coli urogenital infections.

### Antimicrobial resistance trends in urine Escherichia coli isolates from adult and adolescent females in the United States from 2011 to 2019: rising ESBL strains and impact on patient management [^116dCdYy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Using a large data set of urine E. coli isolates from females attending outpatient facilities in the US, this study demonstrated a high prevalence of nonsusceptible E. coli, with significant variation in prevalence depending on geographic location within the US. Moreover, the prevalence of ESBL+ and E. coli isolates in the ≥ 3 nonsusceptible phenotype category increased annually between 2011 and 2019. High rates of AMR and MDR E. coli limit the effective empiric options for the treatment of uUTI. Raising awareness of current regional patterns of nonsusceptible E. coli isolates from outpatient UTIs can help to guide empiric treatment decisions of physicians and demonstrate the need for both antimicrobial stewardship efforts in outpatient settings, as well as new oral antibiotics to address the growing prevalence of resistant E. coli in the US.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^112WEVzq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114K6TrV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 14

Antibiotic regimens with activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria should be used for selected patients with IAIs who are strongly suspected or proved to be harbouring a resistant pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Initial antibiotic therapy for cIAIs is typically empiric in nature because standard microbiologic data and susceptibility results generally require 24–72 h after peritoneal fluid specimen collection. Blood cultures are seldom positive in cIAI (< 10%) and therefore largely unreliable. Typical bacterial pathogens in IAIs reflect endogenous gut flora including Enterobacterales such as E. coli and Klebsiella spp. viridans group Streptococcus, and anaerobes (especially Bacteroides spp.). Historically, cIAI pathogens tended to have greater susceptibility in community- as opposed to hospital-acquired infections.

IAIs caused by susceptible bacteria may be managed by beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g. ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or piperacillin/tazobactam), or a non-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem). Increasing AMR to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid among E. coli and other Enterobacterales worldwide has compromised its clinical utility for empiric therapy; it should only be prescribed as targeted therapy based on demonstrated susceptibility. The comparably broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam makes it still useful in managing severe IAIs. However, the anti-pseudomonal activity of piperacillin/tazobactam is unnecessary for most community-acquired cIAIs, and its use in hospital-acquired infections should be determined based on local microbiologic epidemiology.

Many isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacterales are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins that, in combination with metronidazole, may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity than third-generation cephalosporins. Compared to ceftriaxone, cefepime is poorly hydrolysed by AmpC beta-lactamase, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must also be given with metronidazole. Fluoroquinolones have been prescribed widely for the treatment of IAIs because of their putative activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability. However, resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to fluoroquinolones has increased substantially over time, limiting their use for empiric treatment of IAIs.

### Increase in the community circulation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli despite reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [^1115L2w2]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance has reached pandemic proportions in the last few decades, increasing the mortality rates and healthcare costs associated with the prescription of ineffective antibiotics. These developments prompted the establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programs in healthcare institutions to minimize the overuse of antibiotics and optimize appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration of therapy. However, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are often circulating in the community as 'commensal' microbiota colonizing healthy individuals –, and it remains unclear how antibiotic use reduction has affected their prevalence in that reservoir.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) — bladder cystitis, pyelonephritis, and urosepsis of both community and nosocomial origin — are among the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment. Women of postmenopausal age — generally 50 years or older (50+ yo) — are especially at high risk for severe and drug-resistant forms of UTI. UTIs are primarily caused by extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli that are mostly associated with strains from specific clonal groups. Resident gut bacteria carried by the patient as commensal microbiota are the primary reservoir of UTI-causing E. coli, including the drug-resistant strains.

### Chicken as reservoir for extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in humans, Canada [^111w22HM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is the leading cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans, accounting for > 85% of UTIs. Each year, 6–8 million UTIs are diagnosed in the United States, and 130–175 million are diagnosed worldwide. Estimated direct health care costs related to uncomplicated UTIs in the United States are $1–$2 billion per year. UTIs also can lead to more severe illnesses, such as pyelonephritis, bacteremia, and sepsis. During the past decade, the emergence of drug-resistant E. coli has dramatically increased. As a consequence, the management of UTIs, which was previously straightforward, has become more complicated; the risks for treatment failure are higher, and the cost of UTI treatment is increasing.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^114UPXv9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### CQUIN audit for prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in an acute medical assessment unit [^117MMKr4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis in medical admissions unit. NHS Choices states that around half of all UK women will have a UTI at least once in their lives and one in 2000 healthy men will have one at least once a year. There is a higher mortality and morbidity associated with UTIs in critically ill patients, and it is important that UTIs are treated promptly and adequately.

Moreover, numerous studies have shown an increasing resistance to several common antibiotics; of note in 2001 the first international survey of prevalence and susceptibility of organisms causing uncomplicated UTIs in the community (ECO-SENS Project), found that 42% E. coli isolated (accounting for 77% of pathogens cultured) was resistant to one or more of the more common antibiotics. The microbiology departments of hospital Trusts develop guidelines on first and second line antibiotics to treat infections based on local organisms and sensitivities.

### Management of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae infections [^114QFt4x]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem resistance is defined as in vitro non-susceptibility to any carbapenem and/or documented production of a carbapenemase. This feature has rapidly spread worldwide among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, mostly Klebsiella spp., and is associated with diverse molecular mechanisms. Carbapenem resistance is often associated with resistance to all traditional β-lactams and other classes of antibiotics, denoting a typical example of an extensively drug-resistant phenotype.

Objectives

To summarize and interpret in a balanced manner the most clinically relevant data in terms of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infection management.

Sources

Data were extracted by PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov search and manual scrutiny among references of analysed articles.

Content

Features of newer and older, rediscovered antimicrobial options for CRE are described. Observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCT) of CRE treatment are summarized, with a specific focus on the effects of monotherapy compared with combination treatment.

Implications

The available evidence on the current management of CRE mostly comes from observational, non-comparative, retrospective, small studies, with a high risk of selection bias. Very little evidence comes from RCT. Conflicting results of RCT and observational studies call for caution before combination therapies are deemed superior to monotherapy. Data on newer agents have spurred enthusiasm but remain limited as concerns severe CRE infections. A balanced approach should guide the clinician in the choice of old or new drugs, and of monotherapies or combination regimens. Efforts should be made to perform adequately sized clinical trials answering well-defined research questions.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### A systematic review of antimicrobial stewardship interventions to improve management of bacteriuria in hospitalized adults [^115W7p6E]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality of care

Six studies assessed quality-of-care outcomes as defined by appropriateness of antimicrobial use,-, or local guideline adherenceas a primary outcome. The studies used a variety of interventions; most used education either aloneor combined with audit and feedback. Six studies demonstrated a statistically significant change in target AMS practice compared to baseline or usual care after intervention delivery, including decrease in inappropriate antibiotic therapy,-, or improvement in overall quality indicator sum score. Spoorenberg et alwas the only study to also compare the effectiveness of 2 strategies: they compared a multifaceted strategy including feedback, education, and reminders to a less time-consuming competitive audit and feedback strategy that included individual feedback with nonanonymous ranking of departments and found no difference between the 2 arms in quality of care measures. Only 2 studies assessed the effectiveness of a modified reporting intervention on appropriateness of antimicrobial use. These studies assessed modified reporting of positive urine cultures and showed statistically significant improvement of appropriate treatment of ASB compared to control. One study that assessed implementation of an electronic phone app failed to show improvement in adherence to guidelines compared to usual care.

Resource use and utilization of services

Resource use was reported frequently, with 9 studies assessing the impact of AMS interventions on resource use -, or utilization of services, as a primary or secondary outcome. Most of these studies were multifaceted and included education with audit and feedback, reminders, clinical decision support, or guideline implementation.-, Other studies assessed formulary restrictionand modified reporting of urine cultures. The impact of these interventions on resource use primarily resulted in less microbiologic testing, and a decline in antibiotic utilization. Cost savings of modified culture reporting was assessed by Daley et alwho found no significant benefit. One study assessed the impact of electronic decision support on hospital length of stay and found no significant decrease compared to control groups.

Adverse effects or harms

One study reported adverse effects or harms as outcomes.O'Brien et alevaluated restriction of fluoroquinolones and reported a decline in antimicrobial resistance after the intervention was implemented, with the proportion of E. coli isolates nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin decreasing from 41.5% to 32.8%, and there were no other infection control policies or procedures that may have impacted resistance patterns implemented concurrently.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^116NhJ5m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for treating patients with the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. To avoid excessive carbapenem use, however, de-escalation to other agents, such as piperacillin-tazobactam when a MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (according to the EUCAST breakpoint) is detected, can be considered. Several studies compared piperacillin-tazobactam with carbapenems in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the MERINO trial, the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in the treatment of BSIs caused by ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae was compared, showing an overall 30-day mortality rate threefold higher in the piperacillin-tazobactam arm than in the meropenem one (12.3% versus 3.7%, p = 0.90). Since the low mortality rate in the meropenem group was an unexpected finding, the results of this study have been debated and several issues may have influenced the outcomes of this trial. Among the debated biases, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment of piperacillin-tazobactam was not optimized, as the trial favoured intermittent 1-h infusion over a prolonged infusion protocol. Also, from a microbiological point of view, the use of the E-test to determine piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility led to an elevated percentage of OXA-1-producing pathogens being incorrectly identified as piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible (E-test method cannot detect OXA-1). In a second comparative study (MERINO-2 trial), 72 patients with BSIs due to chromosomal AmpC producers were enrolled in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where they were assigned 1:1 to receive piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. Piperacillin-tazobactam led to more microbiological failures, although fewer microbiological relapses were observed. Despite several pieces of evidence coming from observational studies showed no significant difference in efficacy and mortality rate between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems among patients with ESBL-producing BSIs, the use of a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) for severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales is generally recommended in critically ill patients.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and doxycycline guidance is as follows: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not suggested for the treatment of ESBL-E cystitis, with a randomized trial comparing a 3-day amoxicillin-clavulanic regimen (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) to ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) in 370 women showing clinical cure in 58% versus 77% and higher persistent vaginal bacterial colonization in 45% versus 10%; the proportion infected with ESBL-E strains was not available and both agents were administered at dosages lower than generally suggested. The panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis, citing limited urinary excretion (35%–60%) and lack of convincing data for clinical effectiveness.

The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a categorical guide for clinicians, i.e. as "susceptible", "resistant", or "intermediate", according to Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria in the United States or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria in Europe.

Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into bile may be helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal infections (Recommendation 1C).

Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are those isolated in intra-abdominal infections including the gram-negative aerobes, E. coli and K. pneumonia and anaerobes, especially B. fragilis. The role of enterococci in biliary tract infections remains unclear, and specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely suggested for community-acquired biliary infections.

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations too. Obviously in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated in Table 5.

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is recommended for patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak (Recommendation 1C).

The epidemiological profile of Candida spp in the context of nosocomial peritonitis is incompletely defined. Its clinical presence is usually associated with poor prognosis. Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp is typically not recommended for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of critically ill patients or immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and addressed Candida peritonitis. IDSA guidelines suggested considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.

Ampicillin–sulbactam — role in empiric therapy for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Based on clinical and microbiologic data, the task force concluded that other agents were preferable to ampicillin–sulbactam for the empiric treatment of patients with IAI, noting limited efficacy studies and low susceptibility of Escherichia coli. In the most recent SMART data, only 34% of hospital-associated strains and 45% of community-acquired strains of E. coli were susceptible to this agent, and one study since 2008 found ampicillin–sulbactam inferior to ertapenem. Although ampicillin–sulbactam does have some activity against A. baumannii and may have use in pathogen-directed therapy, the majority of Acinetobacter strains isolated from patients with IAI are not susceptible.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamase producing Escherichia coli: changing epidemiology and clinical impact [^115gNPYH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the recent findings (July 2008-January 2010) on extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, mainly focussed on the epidemiology and clinical impact of infections owing to this pathogen.

Recent Findings

CTX-M-producing E. coli, mainly the CTX-M-15 producers, has emerged and disseminated worldwide as an important cause of both nosocomial and community-onset infections. The clonal spread of the ST131 epidemic E. coli strain is linked not only to the CTX-M-15 pandemia but also to other ESBLs types. The most commonly reported risk factors for community-onset ESBL-producing E. coli infections are contact with healthcare centres, recent use of antimicrobial agents, and presence of comorbidities. But infections owing to ESBL-producing E. coli in patients without obvious risk factors can occur, probably related to the increase of healthy carriers colonized with this pathogen. The main significant predictor of mortality caused by ESBL-producing E. coli is inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy. Alternatives of treatment of severe ESBL-producing E. coli infections included carbapenems, amikacin, tigecycline, and [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations; with some of them enough clinical evidence is lacking (tigecycline, [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations). For urinary tract infections, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin could be useful.

Summary

The worldwide emergence of multiresistant ESBL-producing E. coli raises key therapeutic problems; interventions addressed to their quick detection and early appropriate antibiotic treatment and prevention are urgently needed.

### Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option? [^113DBEdm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women recommend empiric therapy with antibiotics for which local resistance rates do not exceed 10–20%. We hypothesized that resistance rates of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones may have surpassed this level in older women in the Israeli community setting.

Objectives

To identify age groups of women in which fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric treatment of UTI.

Methods

Resistance rates for ofloxacin were calculated for all cases of uncomplicated UTI diagnosed during the first 5 months of 2005 in a managed care organization (MCO) in Israel, in community-dwelling women aged 41–75 years. The women were without risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance. Uncomplicated UTI was diagnosed with a urine culture positive for E. coli. The data set was stratified for age, using 5 year intervals, and stratum-specific resistance rates (% and 95% CI) were calculated. These data were analyzed to identify age groups in which resistance rates have surpassed 10%.

Results

The data from 1291 urine cultures were included. The crude resistance rate to ofloxacin was 8.7% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.2). Resistance was lowest among the youngest (aged 41–50 y) women (3.2%; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18), approached 10% in women aged 51–55 years (7.1%; 95% CI 3.4 to 10.9), and reached 19.86% (95% CI 13.2 to 26.5) among the oldest women (aged 56–75 y).

Conclusions

Physicians who opt to treat UTI in postmenopausal women empirically should consider prescribing drugs other than fluoroquinolones. Concomitant longitudinal surveillance of both antibiotic utilization patterns and uropathogen resistance rates should become routine practice in this managed-care organization.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^1172aY5N]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Cirrhotic patients with severe sepsis and septic shock require emergency care during the early stage of sepsis (especially the first 6 h). Early and appropriate initiation of antibiotics correlates with higher survival rate. A retrospective study by Kumar et al suggested that each hour of delay decreased survival by 7.6%. Choosing adequate empiric antimicrobial treatment will therefore improve the prognosis of patients.

Microbiological samples should be taken as early as possible when infection is suspected, before starting empiric antibiotic therapy and empiric antimicrobial therapy will need to be adapted to local epidemiology, prevalence of antibiotic resistance and results of bacterial cultures. Empiric antibiotic treatments for classical community-acquired bacterial infec tions are shown in Table 1. The relevant causative bacteria as well as empiric antibiotic treatments for classical community-acquired bacterial infections in cirrhosis are as follows: In SBP where the commonest organisms are E. coli, Streptococcus viridans and Enterobacter spp. preferred antibiotic regimens are cefotaxime (2 g/6 h or 2 g/12 h IV) or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1–0.2 g /8 h then 0.5–0.125 g/8 h PO) or ofloxacin (400 mg/12 h PO). Courses should not last less than 5–7 days. Intravenous albumin administration reduces the incidence of renal impairment (from 33% to 10%) and improves hospital survival (from 71% to 90%) in patients with SBP.

Table 1
Empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired bacterial infections in cirrhosis

In urinary tract infections with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. being the commonest causative organisms, suggested regimens are ciprofloxacin (500 mg/12 h PO) or cotrimoxazole (160–800 mg/12 h PO) or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1–0.2 g/8 h PO). Patients with complicated cystitis must be treated for at least 5 days, and in case of pyelonephritis, antibiotic therapy should be prolonged for 10–14 days.

In pneumonia the commonest causative organisms are S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. The suggested regimens are amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1–0.2 g/8 h IV) and macrolide or moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h PO). Patients with community-acquired pneumonia must be treated for a minimum of 5 days.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Management of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [^1172fGCC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Optimizing the management of antibiotic resistance is an important strategy in improving outcomes for infectious diseases in older persons. Strategies that manage antibiotic resistance must take into account all clinical settings, because resistant pathogens previously seen only in acute care facilities are becoming increasingly common in long-term care facilities. Recently, modest improvement in therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due to resistant pathogens has become available because of the development of newer antibiotics. Some of these drugs are briefly discussed in this review, but the best strategy is to limit the potential for the development of resistance and transmission of these pathogens. This can best be accomplished by minimizing misuse of antibiotics and maximizing adherence to basic hygiene standards.

Ertapenem is also a good option in areas with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in the community.

### New and old lessons from a devastating case of neonatal E. coli meningitis [^1162ZHDc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal E coli sepsis results in high morbidity and mortality due to complex host and environmental factors, but early identification and appropriate treatment limits progression to meningitis and/or significant parenchymal damage (encephalitis). Recurrence or relapse of CNS infection is a well-recognized entity of neonatal E coli meningitis with increased risk associated with the K1 virulence factor and signs of complicated infection (abnormalities on brain imaging: ventriculitis, abscess or clinical signs of CNS infection: seizures or altered mental status). Therefore, repeat LP to document sterility prior to the end of antibiotics has been a longstanding recommendation.

Neonatal EOS presents within the first 72 h of life. Late onset sepsis (LOS) presents in the first 4 to 28 days of life. EOS pathogens colonize the infant as they pass through the vaginal canal. Risk of EOS increases with prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal fever or infection. Conversely, LOS pathogens are obtained from the neonates' environment with significantly increased risk of severe infection for very low birthweight premature infants. Group B Streptococcal (GBS) and E coli are the most common pathogens responsible for EOS, with E coli rates rising, while a variety of gram positive and negative species are responsible for LOS without a particular pathogen predominance. Empiric therapy for EOS is generally ampicillin and gentamicin. If meningitis is a concern, cefotaxime or cefepime are recommended with ampicillin; gentamicin has limited CNS penetration due to its large, hydrophilic nature. Consequently, aminoglycosides can be used as an adjunct but are not reliable as the primary treatment for meningitis. Recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy for LOS now include a broad-spectrum 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin ± vancomycin due to the wide range of causative bacterial organisms and concerns for highly pathogenic gram-negative organisms. However, recommendations for empiric therapy for EOS continue to be ampicillin and gentamicin.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: an emerging public-health concern [^113AUQrZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The medical community relies on clinical expertise and published guidelines to assist physicians with choices in empirical therapy for system-based infectious syndromes, such as community-acquired pneumonia and urinary-tract infections (UTIs). From the late 1990s, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mostly Escherichia coli) that produce extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs), such as the CTX-M enzymes, have emerged within the community setting as an important cause of UTIs. Recent reports have also described ESBL-producing E coli as a cause of bloodstream infections associated with these community-onset UTIs. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Thus, more rapid diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the possible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteraemia associated with UTIs are required.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women [^116N2vgn]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common bacterial infection of the renal pelvis and kidney most often seen in young adult women. History and physical examination are the most useful tools for diagnosis. Most patients have fever, although it may be absent early in the illness. Flank pain is nearly universal, and its absence should raise suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A positive urinalysis confirms the diagnosis in patients with a compatible history and physical examination. Urine culture should be obtained in all patients to guide antibiotic therapy if the patient does not respond to initial empiric antibiotic regimens. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen in acute pyelonephritis, and in the past decade, there has been an increasing rate of E. coli resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. Imaging, usually with contrast-enhanced computed tomography, is not necessary unless there is no improvement in the patient's symptoms or if there is symptom recurrence after initial improvement. Outpatient treatment is appropriate for most patients. Inpatient therapy is recommended for patients who have severe illness or in whom a complication is suspected. Practice guidelines recommend oral fluoroquinolones as initial outpatient therapy if the rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the community is 10 percent or less. If the resistance rate exceeds 10 percent, an initial intravenous dose of ceftriaxone or gentamicin should be given, followed by an oral fluoroquinolone regimen. Oral beta-lactam antibiotics and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are generally inappropriate for outpatient therapy because of high resistance rates. Several antibiotic regimens can be used for inpatient treatment, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^111cqEBQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### The role of early use of carbapenems perioperatively for urolithiasis with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli [^111T7145]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections, which is closely associated with urinary tract calculi. With excessive and unreasonable antibiotics applied, UTI caused by ESBL (extended-spectrum β-lactamase)-producing E. coli has increased year by year. The infection is more difficult to manage since the organisms are resistant to most antibiotics. Urolithiasis is a substantial health problem with a prevalence of 6.4% and a 10-year recurrence rate of approximately 50%. At present, surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for stones > 1 cm and stone-free rates have increased considerably with new developments in instruments and techniques. However, the incidence of postoperative infection-related events in urolithiasis patients with ESBL-producing E. coli infection is still high, resulting in various complications, such as fever, bleeding, uremia and even death.

The treatment for UTI caused by ESBL-producing E. coli requires empiric antibiotic therapy. To be able to select safe, effective, and preferable antibiotics for the first line therapy, it is crucial that the antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance patterns of the drugs are determined. Studies have shown that the risk factors for greater susceptibility to UTI are older age, female gender, urinary abnormalities, urinary tract obstructions, impaired immune response, urinary catheter inserted, and surgical procedures of the urinary tract. In clinical practice, the effect of selecting perioperative antibiotics based on antimicrobial sensitivity has been found to be unsatisfactory, sometimes even with the occurrence of postoperative urosepsis. To the best of our knowledge, the incidence and characteristics of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteria in urolithiasis patients have not yet been discussed in detail. A previous report stated that 15–45% ESBL-producing E. coli infections were not appropriately treated. Some studies in literature have shown that Carbapenem has a higher clinical success rate in patients with biological infection caused by ESBL. However, the indiscriminate use of Carbapenem is not without consequences. The increased use of carbapenem drugs has promoted the emergence of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Moreover, the role of β-lactamase inhibitors in patients infected with ESBL-producing pathogens is unclear.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112NTTp8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### How I manage patients with new delhi metallo-β-lactamase and OXA-48-producing enterobacterales infections: a practical approach [^1172Fwy5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, the global spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) has become one of the greatest challenges for human health. Until the early 2010 s, KPC was the most prevalent carbapenemase worldwide in the United States, Europe, and Israel. This led to widespread use of the terms CRE and "carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales" as near-synonyms. At that time, metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) were primarily reported in Enterobacterales in the Indian subcontinent but were sporadic in Europe. OXA-48 was historically more commonly detected in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from North Africa and Turkey. In recent years, the epidemiological landscape has greatly changed. Both NDM- and OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales have expanded beyond their original endemic regions, becoming increasingly prevalent in several settings.

Thus, knowledge of local epidemiology, use of rapid diagnostic testing methods and implementation of therapeutic strategies to manage infections caused by NDM- or OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales are critical for an optimal patient management. Here, the practical management of a patient with NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection is discussed.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^114TEMVT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We developed predictive models and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed antibiotic classes for uUTI. Our predictive models identified number of previous UTI episodes, prior β-lactam nonsusceptibility, prior fluoroquinolone treatment, Census Bureau region, and race as important predictors of nonsusceptibility to at least 3 antibiotic classes evaluated. Findings from our study provide valuable insight on key patient characteristics to consider when assessing risk of antibiotic nonsusceptibility, thereby advancing the understanding of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in uUTI, and potentially informing optimal treatment strategies in this population. Future studies can provide additional insights by validating our models in different clinical settings and in ex-US populations and recalibrating them to include population-level features such as local antibiotic nonsusceptibility rates.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

Among Gram-positive bacteria, enterococci may play a significant role in IAIs. Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where enterococci coverage should be always considered.

The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

IAIs may be managed by either single or multiple antibiotic regimens. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae worldwide, during the last decade, has compromised the clinical utility of this agent for empiric therapy of serious Gram-negative infections and therefore should be used based on local rates of resistance. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

Most isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae remain susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and in combination with metronidazole and may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) have been widely used in the treatment of IAIs because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. In recent years, the resistance of E. coli to FQ has risen over time. The worldwide increase in FQ resistance among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae has limited the use of FQ for empirical treatment of IAIs.

For decades, carbapenems have been the antibiotics of first choice for ESBLs. The best option for targeting ESBLs (although lacking coverage of P. aeruginosa) is ertapenem, a once-daily administered carbapenem that otherwise shares the activity of imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem against most species, including ESBL producing pathogens. Imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem provide coverage for Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). The use of carbapenems should be limited to preserve the activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem resistance.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Non-Escherichia coli versus Escherichia coli community-acquired urinary tract infections in children hospitalized in a tertiary center: relative frequency, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance and outcome [^113xXaxs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Currently hospitalization for children with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is reserved for severe or complicated cases. Changes may have taken place in the characteristics and causative uropathogens of hospital-treated community-acquired UTI.

Objectives

To study children hospitalized in a tertiary center with community-acquired UTI, compare Escherichia coli and non-E. coli UTI, define predictors for non-E. coli UTI and elucidate the appropriate therapeutic approach.

Patients and Methods

A prospective clinical and laboratory study from 2001 through 2002 in a tertiary pediatric medical center. Patients were divided by results of the urine culture into E. coli and non-E. coli UTI groups, which were compared.

Results

Of 175 episodes of culture-proved UTI, 70 (40%) were caused by non-E. coli pathogens. Non-E. coli UTI was more commonly found in children who were male (P = 0.005), who had underlying renal abnormalities (P = 0.0085) and who had received antibiotic therapy in the prior month (P = 0.0009). Non-E. coli uropathogens were often resistant to antibiotics usually recommended for initial therapy for UTI, including cephalosporins and aminoglycosides; 19% were initially treated with inappropriate empiric intravenous antibiotics (compared with 2% for E. coli UTI, P = 0.0001), with a longer hospitalization.

Conclusions

Current treatment routines are often inappropriate for hospitalized children with non-E. coli UTI, which is relatively common in this population. The defined risk factors associated with non-E. coli UTIs and its antimicrobial resistance patterns should be considered to improve empiric antibiotic therapy for these infections.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112kiYNm]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society — resistant gram-negative pathogens in hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) are described as broader and often resistant compared with community-acquired disease: Compared with patients with CA-IAI, those with HA-IAI are infected with a much wider variety of gram-negative pathogens, many of which are resistant to various antibiotic agents. Although Escherichia coli is still the most common gram-negative pathogen identified in HA-IAI, other Enterobacteraceae, such as Enterobacter spp., and non–lactose-fermenting gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, are encountered with some frequency. These pathogens develop resistance via mechanisms including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, efflux pumps, porin loss, or target site modifications, and simultaneous resistance to several antibiotic classes is relatively common. The risk factors for HA-IAI because of resistant gram-negative pathogens mirror those for HA-IAI in general.
