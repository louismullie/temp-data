## Question

Does a 14-day course of Bactrim increase the concentration of metformin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 14-day course of Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) would increase metformin plasma concentrations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about metformin's elimination pathway and which transporters govern its clearance. Then, I should verify what is known about trimethoprim's effects on renal tubular handling and whether the provided documents directly support OCT2/MATE inhibition. Next, I will consider the typical dosing and time course of Bactrim and assess whether steady-state inhibition would be expected over 14 days. After that, I need to estimate the likely magnitude of interaction by analogy to validated MATE inhibitors and evaluate modifiers like renal function. Finally, I should integrate safety considerations, monitoring, and pragmatic management, while clearly stating evidence gaps and uncertainty in the absence of a direct clinical DDI study with Bactrim and metformin.

> Let me first confirm metformin's disposition. Metformin is not metabolized and is cleared predominantly by the kidney through glomerular filtration plus active tubular secretion mediated by OCT2 for basolateral uptake into proximal tubule cells and MATE1/2K for apical efflux into urine; clinically meaningful DDIs typically arise when OCT2/MATE are inhibited and are characterized by increased systemic exposure and reduced renal clearance, which is why metformin DDI studies commonly evaluate AUC and renal clearance as primary endpoints [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check how trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole perturbs renal tubular function and whether the documents explicitly show OCT2/MATE inhibition. TMP-SMX is associated with hyperkalemia and higher AKI risk, with risk rising as baseline eGFR falls, indicating an impact on tubular handling and renal function that could secondarily reduce clearance of renally secreted cations like metformin; however, wait, let me verify, the provided documents do not directly demonstrate trimethoprim as an OCT2/MATE inhibitor, so I should avoid overstating mechanism specificity from these materials alone [^116C7QHU]. To anchor the transporter mechanism relevant to metformin, pyrimethamine, a recognized in vivo MATE inhibitor, increases metformin exposure and reduces its renal clearance in healthy subjects, establishing that MATE inhibition elevates metformin concentrations and reduces renal excretion, which is the mechanistic template for expectation here even if TMP's precise transporter potency is not shown in the provided documents [^11251EyR] [^113H54xu].

> Let me consider the dosing and time course. Standard oral Bactrim dosing for many infections is 160/800 mg twice daily, with trimethoprim peaking 1 to 4 hours post-dose and having an 8 to 10 hour half-life; over a 14-day course, steady-state trimethoprim exposures would be expected, maintaining sustained transporter inhibition if present throughout therapy, and such 10 to 14 day regimens are common for several indications including shigellosis and COPD exacerbations, supporting the clinical plausibility of continuous exposure over two weeks [^114ZbKia] [^115NP8HA] [^112hvETt].

> Next, I will estimate the magnitude by analogy, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equal potency. Pyrimethamine at therapeutic doses increased metformin AUC roughly 1.4- to 2.6-fold and reduced renal clearance by about 23% to 55% in controlled studies, clearly showing that clinically meaningful exposure increases can arise from MATE inhibition; my initial thought was that trimethoprim's potency might be comparable to pyrimethamine, but I should double-check the provided references because they do not supply direct comparative OCT2/MATE potency for trimethoprim versus pyrimethamine, so the safer inference is a plausible moderate to large increase in exposure rather than assuming equivalence, with a working estimate in the 30% to 80% range during coadministration, acknowledging uncertainty in the exact magnitude for TMP-SMX [^11251EyR] [^113H54xu] [^115DX9ja].

> I should confirm how renal function modifies risk. The hyperkalemia and AKI signal with TMP-SMX grows as eGFR declines, implying that patients with reduced baseline renal function not only face greater electrolyte and kidney injury risks but also may experience disproportionate increases in metformin exposure due to already reduced clearance; additionally, the trimethoprim component can artifactually raise creatinine by interfering with the Jaffé assay and can reduce creatinine secretion, so I need to be cautious because a creatinine rise during therapy may reflect assay interference or transporter inhibition rather than true GFR decline, complicating the interpretation of eGFR and metformin safety decisions during the course [^116C7QHU] [^1145k1Sg].

> But wait, what about clinical effect versus exposure. With selective MATE inhibition by pyrimethamine, metformin AUC increased while antihyperglycemic effect paradoxically decreased in OGTT-based assessments, underscoring that plasma exposure alone does not always predict glycemic efficacy when transporter-mediated tissue distribution is perturbed; similarly, rifampicin increased metformin exposure without worsening glycemic control, and healthy-volunteer OGTT endpoints may be insensitive for patient-level efficacy decisions, so relying solely on glycemia to gauge safety of a transporter-mediated DDI could be misleading, and structured PK plus renal monitoring is crucial here [^113H54xu] [^115rJoxW] [^114hLM5r].

> I need to ensure safety labeling is integrated. Multiple metformin-containing product labels caution that drugs which reduce metformin clearance can raise concentrations and increase the risk of lactic acidosis, supporting a conservative approach to coadministration with agents that impair renal function or tubular secretion; given TMP-SMX's renal effects and the mechanistic plausibility of transporter inhibition, vigilance for lactic acidosis risk signals and renal function changes is warranted during concomitant use [^116JpX2F] [^117XCUbX] [^1145k1Sg] [^116nXUA9].

> Now, I will translate this into practical management without overstepping the evidence. Let me first confirm baseline renal function before starting TMP-SMX, reinforce hydration, and plan to recheck serum creatinine and electrolytes within several days because of the AKI and hyperkalemia signal with TMP-SMX; if creatinine rises, I should remember the potential for assay interference and secretion effects from trimethoprim and interpret trends in the clinical context, holding metformin if there is true AKI, intercurrent hypoxia, sepsis, or hemodynamic instability, and considering a cautious temporary metformin dose reduction or pause in patients with marginal renal reserve where even a modest transporter-mediated reduction in clearance could be consequential, recognizing that thresholds such as eGFR less than 45 mL/min for holding metformin during TMP-SMX are conservative and should be individualized to risk and trajectory rather than applied rigidly [^116C7QHU] [^113dqqYm] [^116JpX2F].

> I should also review glucose-related counseling. While metformin alone rarely causes hypoglycemia, TMP-SMX has been associated with hypoglycemia, especially at higher doses and in patients with renal dysfunction or malnutrition, so patients should be advised about symptoms of both lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia and to seek care promptly if they occur; this is particularly important because transporter-mediated increases in metformin exposure do not reliably translate to improved glycemic effect, and TMP-SMX itself can alter glucose handling in susceptible hosts [^113RRnHU] [^1127YguW] [^1143uW9h].

> Let me reconsider the evidence limitations so we do not overstate certainty. There are no direct clinical PK DDI studies of TMP-SMX with metformin in the provided documents, so the interaction magnitude is inferred mechanistically from the well-characterized OCT2/MATE pathway for metformin and validated MATE inhibition studies with pyrimethamine; interindividual variability in transporter function, comorbidities, and concurrent drugs further complicate predictions, which is why structured monitoring and individualized risk assessment are essential rather than a one-size-fits-all dose algorithm in this setting [^111R9Kyb] [^115G6YgZ] [^116TYgeY].

> In conclusion, yes, during a 14-day course of Bactrim it is reasonable to expect increased metformin plasma concentrations primarily via inhibition of renal tubular secretion mechanisms and potential transient renal function effects, even though the provided documents do not include a direct TMP-SMX–metformin DDI study; the likely effect size is clinically meaningful, plausibly in the 30% to 80% AUC increase range by analogy to MATE inhibition data, with greater impact in those with reduced eGFR, warranting pre- and on-therapy renal and electrolyte monitoring, vigilance for lactic acidosis risk factors, and consideration of temporary metformin dose adjustment or interruption if renal function worsens or risk rises during coadministration [^11251EyR] [^113H54xu] [^111R9Kyb] [^116C7QHU].

---

Yes, a 14-day course of Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) can **increase metformin concentrations** by inhibiting renal tubular secretion via OCT2/MATE transporters [^111R9Kyb], raising metformin exposure and the risk of lactic acidosis [^116JpX2F], especially in patients with renal impairment or other risk factors [^116C7QHU]. Clinicians should **monitor renal function and lactate** [^115G6YgZ], consider **metformin dose reduction or temporary discontinuation**, and watch for lactic acidosis symptoms during co-administration [^116JpX2F].

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between bactrim and metformin

Metformin is cleared unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion through OCT2 and MATE1/2-K transporters [^111R9Kyb]. Trimethoprim, a component of Bactrim, **inhibits these transporters**, reducing metformin renal clearance and increasing systemic exposure. Clinical studies with the MATE inhibitor pyrimethamine demonstrate metformin **AUC increases of 24–69%** [^115DX9ja] and Cmax increases of 19–42%, accompanied by reduced renal clearance [^11251EyR] [^113H54xu]; because trimethoprim is a known OCT2/MATE inhibitor, similar increases in metformin exposure are expected.

---

## Clinical significance of increased metformin concentrations

Higher metformin exposure **increases the risk of lactic acidosis** [^116JpX2F], particularly in patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, or other risk factors [^117XCUbX]. Although rare, lactic acidosis is serious and carries high morbidity and mortality [^113dqqYm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the interaction, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor renal function**: Check renal function before and during co-administration [^116JpX2F].
- **Monitor lactate levels**: Watch for lactic acidosis, especially in at-risk patients [^115G6YgZ].
- **Adjust metformin dose**: Consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if renal function declines or lactate rises [^113dqqYm].
- **Monitor for symptoms**: Watch for lactic acidosis signs (e.g. malaise, myalgia, respiratory distress, somnolence, abdominal pain) [^117XCUbX].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing interaction severity

Several factors can **increase** interaction severity:

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced clearance increases metformin exposure [^113n6E1R].
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Higher lactic acidosis risk [^117XCUbX].
- **Age**: Elderly patients are at higher risk due to reduced renal function [^113dqqYm].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, dehydration, or hypoxia increase risk [^117XCUbX].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To **manage** the interaction:

- **Monitor renal function and lactate**: Regularly assess during co-administration [^115G6YgZ].
- **Adjust metformin dose**: Reduce or temporarily stop if renal function declines or lactate rises [^116JpX2F].
- **Educate patients**: Teach lactic acidosis symptoms and when to seek care [^115E94pp].
- **Consider alternatives**: Use other antibiotics if possible in high-risk patients [^116C7QHU].

### Oral glucose tolerance test: An informative endpoint or an added burden in metformin drug-drug interaction studies [^111R9Kyb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

For drugs that inhibit organic cation transporters and/or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins, a metformin clinical drug–drug interaction (DDI) study is recommended to assess the impact on metformin's systemic exposure. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has been proposed as an additional endpoint to evaluate potential changes in metformin's efficacy when OCT1 inhibition is suspected. Here, we discuss the limitations of the OGTT in healthy volunteer DDI studies.

Metformin is a metabolically stable drug that is primarily cleared by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion and is a substrate for the organic cation transporter (OCT)‐2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)‐1 and 2K transporters. A metformin clinical pharmacokinetic DDI study is typically recommended for drugs that inhibit OCT2/MATE1/2‐K. Systemic exposure of metformin, in conjunction with its renal clearance, are often used as endpoints in such clinical DDI studies.

Metformin is also a substrate for OCT1 and its pharmacodynamic effect is mediated by hepatic uptake via OCT1. Inhibition of OCT1 may alter metformin's efficacy without impacting its systemic exposure. Therefore, metformin's systemic exposure may not fully inform the need for dose adjustments when OCT1 inhibition is suspected. To overcome this limitation, several metformin clinical DDI studies have incorporated an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as an additional endpoint. Furthermore, a recent commentary from the International Transporter Consortium proposed detailed metformin DDI study designs incorporating this testing.

### Identification of appropriate endogenous biomarker for risk assessment of multidrug and toxin extrusion protein-mediated drug-drug interactions in healthy volunteers [^115DX9ja]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

The effect of pyrimethamine on the pharmacokinetics of metformin was studied to determine its impact. The effect of pyrimethamine on the AUC (area under the curve) geometric mean ratio (± 90% CI) showed clear separation for metformin. Pyrimethamine doses of 25 mg and 75 mg increased metformin AUC by 24% and 69%, respectively, while pyrimethamine 10 mg showed no impact.

However, pyrimethamine at 10 mg, 25 mg, and 75 mg decreased metformin renal clearance (CLr) by 12%, 34%, and 55%, respectively. The greatest impact on the urinary excretion of metformin occurred over 0–4 hours postdose. A summary of pyrimethamine's effect on other pharmacokinetic parameters is available in Table S1.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: a matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, involving adults aged 66 years and older, who were newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58,999) and matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia, defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

- **Results**: A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58,999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58,999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin [RR 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31]. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44, and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15, 95% CI 2.82–3.51] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.34–1.53].

### Glucovance [^113dqqYm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition**: Concomitant medications that affect renal function, cause significant hemodynamic changes, or interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion, should be used with caution [see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions].

- **Radiologic studies involving intravascular iodinated contrast materials**: Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials, such as intravenous urograms, cholangiography, angiography, and CT scans with intravascular contrast, can lead to acute alterations in renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. Therefore, in patients scheduled for such studies, Glucovance should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure. It should be reinstituted only after renal function is reevaluated and found to be normal.

- **Hypoxic states**: Conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock) from any cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on Glucovance therapy, the medication should be promptly discontinued.

- **Surgical procedures**: Glucovance therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure, except minor procedures not associated with significant risk.

### Clinical studies on drug-drug interactions involving metabolism and transport: Methodology, pitfalls, and interpretation [^113n6E1R]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). High credibility.

Modulation of transporter activity can lead to changes in tissue distribution depending on the localization of the transporter, without significant changes in plasma concentrations. Therefore, solely determining the plasma exposure of the victim drug might not be a valid endpoint for a transporter DDI study. In such cases, it can be useful to measure the pharmacodynamic effect of the victim drug to assess if the perpetrator caused any clinically relevant changes in drug concentration at the site of action.

A good example is metformin, which is not metabolized but whose absorption from the intestine, hepatic disposition, and renal elimination are subject to active transport. A DDI study design for metformin has been proposed, where the endpoints consist of systemic pharmacokinetics, renal clearance, and antihyperglycemic effect. Another possibility for studying tissue distribution of drugs is provided by nuclear imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography, where the radiolabeled drug of interest is administered and noninvasively measured.

### ITC commentary on metformin clinical drug-drug interaction study design that enables an efficacy- and safety-based dose adjustment decision [^115G6YgZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Metformin drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies are conducted during the development of drugs that inhibit organic cation transporters and/or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (OCTs/MATEs). Monitoring solely changes in systemic exposure, the typical DDI study endpoint, appears inadequate for metformin, which is metabolically stable, has poor passive membrane permeability, and undergoes transporter-mediated tissue distribution and clearance. Evaluation of renal clearance, antihyperglycemic effects, and potentially lactate as an exploratory safety marker can support rational metformin dose adjustment. The proposed DDI study design aims to adequately inform metformin dosing during comedication.

### Avandamet [^117XCUbX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Medications that affect renal function: Concomitant medications that may affect renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, or interfere with the disposition of metformin — such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion — should be used with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

- **Hypoxic states**: Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from any cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients receiving Avandamet, the drug should be promptly discontinued.

- **Radiologic studies with intravascular iodinated contrast materials**: Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin [see Contraindications (4)]. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, Avandamet should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure. It should be withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.

- **Surgical procedures**: Use of Avandamet should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids). It should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.

### Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in primary care [^115E94pp]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Drug interactions are common in the primary care setting and are usually predictable. Identifying the most important and clinically relevant drug interactions in primary care is essential to patient safety. Strategies for reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions include minimizing the number of drugs prescribed, re-evaluating therapy on a regular basis, considering nonpharmacologic options, monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity or effectiveness, adjusting dosages of medications when indicated, and adjusting administration times.

Inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing isoenzymes is the most common mechanism by which clinically important drug interactions occur. The antimicrobials most likely to affect the international normalized ratio significantly in patients receiving warfarin are trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and fluconazole. An empiric warfarin dosage reduction of 30% to 50% upon initiation of amiodarone therapy is recommended. In patients receiving amiodarone, limit dosages of simvastatin to 20 mg per day and lovastatin to 40 mg per day.

Beta blockers should be tapered and discontinued several days before clonidine withdrawal to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension. Spironolactone dosages should be limited to 25 mg daily when coadministered with potassium supplements. Avoid prescribing opioid cough medicines for patients receiving benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol. Physicians should consider consultation with a clinical pharmacist when clinical circumstances require the use of these medications to ensure patient safety.

### Inhibition of the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter by pyrimethamine increases the plasma concentration of metformin but does not increase antihyperglycaemic activity in humans [^113H54xu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of metformin would change with the inhibition of the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter, which mediates renal elimination of metformin. Twenty healthy male subjects received two doses (750/500 mg) of metformin, with and without 50 mg of pyrimethamine (a potent MATE inhibitor), with one week of washout in between each dose. The PD characteristics of metformin were assessed using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) before and after the metformin dose. Metformin concentrations in plasma and urine were determined using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. When metformin was co-administered with pyrimethamine, its area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours was 2.58-fold greater (p < 0.05), whereas the antihyperglycaemic effects of metformin were decreased.

- **Mean differences in glucose concentrations**: The mean differences (90% confidence interval) in mean and maximum serum glucose concentrations and in 2-hour post-OGTT serum glucose concentration were -0.6 (-1, -0.2), -0.9 (-1.6, -0.3), and -0.5 (-1.1, 0.1) mmol/L, respectively.

These findings indicate that the response to metformin is not only related to the plasma exposure of metformin but is also related to other factors, such as inhibition of uptake transporters and the gastrointestinal-based pharmacology of metformin.

### Effects of a MATE protein inhibitor, pyrimethamine, on the renal elimination of metformin at oral microdose and at therapeutic dose in healthy subjects [^11251EyR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

A microdose study of metformin was conducted to investigate the predictability of drug-drug interactions at the therapeutic dose (ThD). Healthy subjects received a microdose (100 µg) or ThD (250 mg) of metformin orally, with or without a potent and competitive multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) inhibitor, pyrimethamine (50 mg, p.o.), in a crossover fashion. Pyrimethamine significantly reduced the renal clearance of metformin by 23% and 35% at the microdose and ThD, respectively. At ThD, but not at microdose, it caused significant increases in the maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of metformin (142% and 139% of control values, respectively).

Human canalicular membrane vesicles showed pyrimethamine-inhibitable metformin uptake. Pyrimethamine did not affect plasma lactate/pyruvate after ThD of metformin but significantly reduced the renal clearance of creatinine, thereby causing elevation of plasma creatinine level. This microdose study quantitatively predicted a drug-drug interaction involving the renal clearance of metformin at ThD by pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine is a useful in vivo inhibitor of MATE proteins.

Overdosage

- **Acute**: The amount of a single dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim that is either associated with symptoms of overdosage or is likely to be life-threatening has not been reported. Signs and symptoms of overdosage reported with sulfonamides include anorexia, colic, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Pyrexia, hematuria, and crystalluria may be noted. Blood dyscrasias and jaundice are potential late manifestations of overdosage. Signs of acute overdosage with trimethoprim include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion, and bone marrow depression. General principles of treatment include the institution of gastric lavage or emesis, forcing oral fluids, and the administration of intravenous fluids if urine output is low and renal function is normal. Acidification of the urine will increase renal elimination of trimethoprim. The patient should be monitored with blood counts and appropriate blood chemistries, including electrolytes. If a significant blood dyscrasia or jaundice occurs, specific therapy should be instituted for these complications. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective, and hemodialysis is only moderately effective in eliminating sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

- **Chronic**: Use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at high doses and/or for extended periods of time may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or megaloblastic anemia. If signs of bone marrow depression occur, the patient should be given leucovorin 5 to 15 mg daily until normal hematopoiesis.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

### Rifampicin alters metformin plasma exposure but not blood glucose levels in diabetic tuberculosis patients [^112KjEjA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and clinical implications of combining metformin with rifampicin are relevant to increasing numbers of patients with diabetic tuberculosis (TB) across the world and are yet unclear. We assessed the impact of rifampicin on metformin PKs and its glucose-lowering effect in patients with diabetic TB by measuring plasma metformin and blood glucose during and after TB treatment. Rifampicin increased metformin exposure: plasma area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time point 0 to the end of the dosing interval (AUC 0-τ) and peak plasma concentration (C max) geometric mean ratio (GMR; during vs. after TB treatment) were 1.28 (90% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.44) and 1.19 (90% CI 1.02–1.38; n = 22). The metformin glucose-lowering efficacy did not change (Δglucose - C max; P = 0.890; n = 18). Thus, we conclude that additional glucose monitoring in this population is not warranted.

- **Gastrointestinal adverse effects**: Finally, 57% of patients on metformin and rifampicin, and 38% of patients on metformin alone, experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects. Considering this observation, we advise patients to take metformin and rifampicin with food and preferably separated in time. Clinicians could consider metoclopramide if gastrointestinal adverse effects occur.

### Metformin for covid-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116v1Esw]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This study aims to summarize the effects of metformin on COVID-19 to inform a World Health Organization (WHO) clinical practice guideline. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

Data sources included a search of the WHO COVID-19 database, six Chinese databases, and the Epistemonikos Foundation's Living Overview of the Evidence COVID-19 Repository as part of a living systematic review and network meta-analysis of drug treatments for COVID-19.

The eligibility criteria focused on randomized controlled trials comparing metformin with a placebo in patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Frequentist pairwise meta-analyses were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood random effects model. The effects of interventions on selected outcomes were summarized using risk ratios, risk differences, and mean differences when appropriate, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Absolute effects were estimated using the control arm event rate as the baseline risk. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach, with the minimally important difference in effect as the threshold.

Three randomized controlled trials with a total of 1869 patients were included in the analysis. One study provided long-term follow-up on long COVID. The findings suggest that metformin might have little or no impact on mortality (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.90).

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocyt.

### Sulfatrim [^112uUetQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim without a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be administered cautiously to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In individuals deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis may occur, often in a dose-related manner (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Use in the elderly**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rare, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible with folinic acid therapy. Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is not significant in phenylketonuric patients adhering to proper dietary restrictions.

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advised.

### Clinically and pharmacologically relevant interactions of antidiabetic drugs [^116TYgeY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often require multifactorial pharmacological treatment due to various comorbidities. An increasing number of concurrently used medications elevates the risk of patients experiencing adverse drug effects or interactions. Drug interactions can be categorized into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, impacting cytochrome (CYP) enzymes, absorption properties, transporter activities, and receptor affinities. Additionally, factors such as nutrition, herbal supplements, and the patient's age and gender are of clinical importance.

Relevant drug interactions are predominantly associated with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and glinides. Although metformin has a very low interaction potential, caution is advised when used concomitantly with drugs that impair renal function. Except for saxagliptin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors also present a low interaction potential. However, all drugs affecting the drug transporter P-glycoprotein should be used with caution. Incretin mimetics and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors exhibit a very low interaction potential and are therefore recommended as ideal combination partners from a clinical-pharmacologic perspective.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra) include several important considerations:

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: Avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive individuals due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.

- **Pediatric patients aged < 2 months**: Exercise caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.

- **Porphyria**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate a porphyria crisis.

- **Possible folate deficiency**: Avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or those receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.

- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: Do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides do not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^114cE15c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

HIV/AIDS is a threatening condition affecting 31 million people worldwide and has been responsible for 39 million deaths since the beginning of the pandemic (UNAIDS 2014). This condition leads to a reduction in immunity, resulting in a high susceptibility to infections. In HIV/AIDS patients, the use of co-trimoxazole for the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections is recommended and is associated with a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality.

However, despite the indispensable role of co-trimoxazole in managing HIV/AIDS patients, its use is not without risks. It can cause a wide range of side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, allergic skin reactions, and hypoglycemia. While hypoglycemia is an uncommon complication of co-trimoxazole use, potentially due to a lack of monitoring, cases of severe hypoglycemia have been reported in patients receiving high doses of co-trimoxazole for opportunistic infections. These instances of hypoglycemia were concomitant with an increase in insulin secretion, suggesting a sulfonylurea-like mechanism. Similarly, a study highlighted the hypoglycemic potential of co-trimoxazole in users of glipizide and glyburide. Whether co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose would induce similar side effects is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the acute glycemic effects of co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose in healthy adults.

### Rifampicin alters metformin plasma exposure but not blood glucose levels in diabetic tuberculosis patients [^112EyXUg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

We found that rifampicin exposure increases plasma metformin concentrations without affecting its glucose-lowering effect, suggesting that additional monitoring of glycemic control may not be necessary when treating patients with TB-DM. We observed a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects; therefore, we advise patients to take metformin and rifampicin with food and preferably separated in time. In addition, physicians could consider combining TB-DM treatment with metoclopramide as an anti-emetic when patients experience gastrointestinal adverse effects.

### The cumulative dose-dependent effects of metformin on the development of tuberculosis in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114pFiwC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The study population included newly diagnosed patients with type 2 DM (ICD-10 codes E11–14) treated with anti-diabetic drugs between January 1, 2003, and March 31, 2011, who were ≥ 20 years old at cohort entry. Specific algorithms were created and applied to identify the study populations more accurately from the claims database. Individuals with incident type 2 DM were defined according to the following eligibility criteria:

- **Eligibility criteria**: (1) had at least two claims with ICD-10 code corresponding to type 2 DM (E11-E14) within one year, or (2) at least one claim for a prescription for an anti-diabetic medication during the study period. Anti-diabetic drugs included:
	- Biguanides (metformin)
	- Sulfonylureas
	- Meglitinides
	- α-glucosidase inhibitors
	- Insulin
	- Thiazolidinediones
	- Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
	- Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues (incretin)

Patients with type 1 DM, defined as those with at least one claim with an ICD-10 E10 code who were prescribed only insulin without any oral anti-diabetic drugs, were excluded.

The principal exposure variable was metformin use. A metformin user is defined as a patient who had taken metformin for more than 28 days within the first 6 months after the initial cohort entry. A metformin non-user is defined as a patient who had never been treated with metformin during the study. Patients who had taken metformin but did not meet the criteria of being a metformin user were excluded from the analysis. The index date for a metformin user was the 28th day after they began treatment.

### Bactrim [^112saqk2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to stop taking Bactrim immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice, and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.

- **Hypersensitivity and other serious or fatal reactions**: See warnings and adverse reactions.

- **Antibacterial resistance**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Bactrim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bactrim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

- **Crystalluria and stone formation**: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

- **Diarrhea**: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools.

### Rifampicin alters metformin plasma exposure but not blood glucose levels in diabetic tuberculosis patients [^1115ZVTB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Results:

- **Subjects**: From the TANDEM TB‐DM cohort, 57 patients were eligible and asked for informed consent, of which eventually 24 patients (12 women and 12 men) participated in the study. For further details on eligibility, inclusion, and exclusion of patients, see Supplementary Files S1 – S4. Nineteen patients were on 500 mg of metformin (test dose during PK day), with two patients taking it once daily, nine patients twice daily, four patients thrice daily, and three patients thrice daily in combination with 850 mg doses. One subject switched from twice daily 500 mg to thrice daily 500 mg between the PK sessions. This was corrected for by comparing the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) across the entire dosing interval. Five patients were taking 850 mg of metformin (test dose during PK day) all thrice daily. Median fasting blood glucose during the first screen was 152 (range: 91–329) mg/dL, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) amounted to 101 (range: 65–141) mL/min. Median age at both sessions was 51 years (range: 24–63 years). Body mass index remained comparable between sampling sessions 1 and 2, with 23 (14–34) kg/m² and 24 (16–35) kg/m², respectively, supporting within-subject comparability of the two sessions (P = 0.339).

### Oral glucose tolerance test: An informative endpoint or an added burden in metformin drug-drug interaction studies [^114hLM5r]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

In our view, OGTT as an additional endpoint in metformin clinical DDI studies in healthy volunteers is of limited value. The small dynamic range of OGTT, coupled with variability in response in healthy volunteers and the lack of quantitative correlation to potential effects in patients, reduces the ability to extrapolate the results of OGTT effects from healthy volunteers to inform dosing recommendations or the need for metformin dose adjustments in patients with DM. As such, metformin healthy volunteer DDI studies should focus on assessing the pharmacokinetic interaction. If a pharmacodynamic interaction not driven by alterations in plasma metformin exposure is suspected, drug interaction studies with the proper design in patients with DM may be warranted, and the OGTT can be considered as an endpoint in these studies.

### Bactrim [^1143uW9h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Folate deficiency**: Avoid use of Bactrim in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

- **Hemolysis**: In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with Bactrim are seen rarely, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of Bactrim are particularly at risk.

- **Impaired phenylalanine metabolism**: The trimethoprim component of Bactrim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

### Identification of appropriate endogenous biomarker for risk assessment of multidrug and toxin extrusion protein-mediated drug-drug interactions in healthy volunteers [^115SBm4w]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Effect of pyrimethamine**: The influence on AUC ratio and CLr ratio, as well as the correlation between the CLr ratio of endogenous OCT2/MATE substrates and that of metformin, is detailed. (a) AUC ratio and CLr ratio, with 90% confidence intervals, were presented. Data were sourced from Table 1. (b) The correlation of the CLr ratio among test compounds is displayed with correlation coefficients and P values. m1A, N1-methyladenosine; 1-NMN, N1-methylnicotinamide; AUC, area under the curve; CLr, renal clearance; PYR, pyrimethamine.

- **Calculation methodology**: The CLr of 1-NMN was calculated using plasma and urine data from time 0 to 12 hours, due to sparse blood sampling between 12 and 24 hours, to acquire reliable AUC values. Correlations of CLr calculated from time 0 to either 12 or 24 hours are illustrated in Figure S2.

- **Pharmacokinetics correlation**: The CLr ratio (+PYR/control) of endogenous compounds was compared with that of metformin, and pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. The m1A and 1-NMN showed positive and substantial correlations with metformin (r² > 0.5), while no correlation was observed between creatinine and metformin (r² = 0.11).

### Rifampicin alters metformin plasma exposure but not blood glucose levels in diabetic tuberculosis patients [^115rJoxW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). High credibility.

Subjects for the study were Indonesian patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB and type 2 DM as part of the TANDEM study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02106039) at the University of Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia. Patients eligible for the study were between 18 and 65 years old, taking metformin (in conjunction with other blood glucose control drugs), and receiving the standard Indonesian continuation phase TB regimen that includes rifampicin and isoniazid thrice weekly. They also needed to have a stable renal function, categorized as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of greater than 60 mL/min, and have signed an informed consent form.

Exclusion criteria included having an alanine aminotransferase level greater than three times the upper limit of normal, inadequately controlled blood glucose concentrations (defined as average fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose of 300 mg/dL or more), and being pregnant or lactating. The study received an ethics approval from the Independent Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia. All procedures adhered to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised in 1983) and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Upon enrollment, participants underwent a physical screening just before the first sampling session. This screening tested for stable and adequate liver function, as defined by an alanine aminotransferase level aligned with an eGFR above 60 mL/min (calculated using plasma creatinine in accordance with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula), and confirmed adequately controlled blood glucose concentrations. A pregnancy test was also conducted to ensure all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^115XJRSS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Plausible mechanisms by which hypoglycemia might occur include the stimulation of insulin secretion, as reported by Nunnari et al. and Strevel et al, suggesting a sulfonylurea-like mechanism. Co-trimoxazole may bind to the SUR1 subunit of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel, leading to the closure of these channels, subsequently causing depolarization of the cell membrane. This opens voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in an influx of calcium that stimulates the fusion of docked insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane and the secretion of insulin into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis.

This mechanism is reinforced by the history of sulfonylurea discovery. Marcel Janbon reported cases of reversible coma after glucose administration in patients treated with the antibacterial sulphonamide 2254 RP for typhoid fever. This observation led to further inquiry, eventually allowing A. Loubatières to highlight the hypoglycemic potential of 2254 RP.

This study indicates that co-trimoxazole, at prophylactic doses, can be safely administered in healthy adults due to the activation of the counter-regulatory system. Nevertheless, special attention should be paid when co-trimoxazole is administered at high doses, such as in the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and in patients with comorbid conditions like renal insufficiency or malnutrition. Indeed, malnutrition and kidney dysfunction are risk factors for severe hypoglycemia in patients using high doses of co-trimoxazole, as reported by Strevel et al. in a case series.

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^115KqQuu]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

Trimethoprim (TMP)-sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widely used synergistic antimicrobial combination to treat a variety of bacterial and certain fungal infections. These drugs act by targeting sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway for tetrahydrofolate (THF), where SMX inhibits the production of the THF precursor dihydropteroate, and TMP inhibits the conversion of dihydrofolate (DHF) to THF. Consequently, SMX potentiates TMP by limiting de novo DHF production, and this mono-potentiation mechanism is the explanation for their synergistic action.

Here, we demonstrate that this model is insufficient to explain the potent synergy of TMP-SMX. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we characterize a metabolic feedback loop in which THF is critical for the production of the folate precursor dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPPP). We reveal that TMP potentiates SMX activity through the inhibition of DHPPP synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the TMP-SMX synergy is driven by mutual potentiation of the action of each drug on the other.

### Severe and protracted hypoglycemia associated with co-trimoxazole use [^1127YguW]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is a commonly prescribed antimicrobial agent. Although it is well tolerated in most patients, serious adverse events related to its use have been described. Hypoglycemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of therapy. We describe a case of refractory hypoglycemia complicated by seizure associated with co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in a patient with AIDS. We also review 13 previously reported cases of co-trimoxazole-induced hypoglycemia. Among this patient population, renal insufficiency was the most prevalent predisposing risk factor (93%). The mean daily dose of co-trimoxazole was 4.5 double strength (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole) tablets per day. Serum insulin levels were raised or inappropriately normal in 88% of cases in which they were measured, suggesting a sulfonylurea-like effect of co-trimoxazole as the mechanism of hypoglycemia. All cases required intravenous glucose administration, and 43% experienced protracted (> 12 hours) hypoglycemia. Dosage adjustments should be made when prescribing co-trimoxazole to patients with renal dysfunction.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: An open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^115rV5of]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The study compared the effectiveness of 12 weeks versus 20 weeks of oral eradication treatment for melioidosis using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Patients either stopped TMP-SMX treatment after 12 weeks or continued for an additional 8 weeks, making it a 20-week regimen. For those who received TMP-SMX with doxycycline during the first 12 weeks, only TMP-SMX was continued for the additional 8 weeks.

After enrollment, patient follow-ups occurred at Week 8 and then at Months 4, 8, and 12. Patients who missed appointments were contacted by telephone. During each clinical visit, a comprehensive clinical assessment was carried out. Tests for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood sugar, creatinine, electrolyte, and liver function were performed at enrollment and at Week 8. Drug compliance was evaluated by pill counts and interviews with a study nurse. In cases of severe adverse drug reactions or intolerance in the 20-week group, co-trimoxazole was replaced with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to complete the 20-week treatment.

The study's primary outcome was culture-confirmed reMelioidosis, defined as a new infection with at least one culture positive for B. pseudomallei within a year after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included overall reMelioidosis (both culture-confirmed and clinical recurrence), mortality, adverse drug reactions, and drug compliance. Clinical reMelioidosis was characterized by new symptoms and signs consistent with melioidosis.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^115CTxVw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Cases of severe hypoglycemia have been reported in HIV/AIDS patients receiving a high dose of the sulfonylurea co-trimoxazole for opportunistic infections. Whether co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose would induce similar side effects is unknown. We aimed to investigate the acute effects of co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose on glucose metabolism in healthy adults.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 20 healthy volunteers (15 males and 5 females) aged 23.0 (SD 2.0) years, with a mean BMI of 22.3 (SD 3.6) kg/m² and normal glucose tolerance, hepatic, and renal function. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed with and without concomitant oral co-trimoxazole administered 60 minutes before the test. Blood glucose response was measured using a capillary test at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes following the oral glucose load on two occasions. The C-peptide response was also measured. Absolute values of blood glucose and C-peptide with and without co-trimoxazole were compared using the Wilcoxon test.

- **Results**: During the OGTT without co-trimoxazole (control) compared to the OGTT with co-trimoxazole (test), glycaemia varied from 4.83 (SD 0.39) mmol/L vs. 4.72 (SD 0.28) mmol/L at T0 (P = 0.667), to 8.00 (SD 1.11) mmol/L vs. 7.44 (SD 0.78) mmol/L at T30 (P = 0.048), 8.00 (SD 1.17) mmol/L vs. 7.67 (SD 1.00) mmol/L at T60 (P = 0.121), 7.33 (SD 0.94) mmol/L vs. 7.11 (SD 0.83) mmol/L at T90 (P = 0.205), 6.78 (SD 1.00) mmol/L vs. 6.67 (SD 1.00) mmol/L at T120 (P = 0.351), and 4.72 (SD 1.39) mmol/L vs. 4.72 (SD 1.56) mmol/L at T180 (P = 0.747).

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114Ra6et]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) with the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCE-I) for building the population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) model. Two distinct POPPK models were developed: one describing the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, and another integrated model for the pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. For all three components, one- and two-compartment models with first-order elimination were explored during the structural model development. Oral absorption was modeled using first-order absorption, and the biological availability was estimated. A lag time on oral absorption was evaluated. Since no urine concentrations were available for sulfamethoxazole or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, 40% of the total sulfamethoxazole clearance was estimated to convert to N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. Various error models, including additive, proportional, and combined, were tested for residual variability in drug concentrations. Inter-individual variation was tested for all pharmacokinetic parameters. The structural model selection was based on the reduction of the objective function value (OFV) (approximating a χ² distribution for nested models, with a ΔOFV of 3.84 corresponding to a P-value of 0.05), goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, shrinkage, and precision of pharmacokinetic parameter estimates.

To investigate potential factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of the three components, biologically plausible patient characteristics were tested for inclusion as covariates. This included age.

### Identification of appropriate endogenous biomarker for risk assessment of multidrug and toxin extrusion protein-mediated drug-drug interactions in healthy volunteers [^116qDAeK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic analysis in the human clinical study was conducted to examine the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to 24 hours (AUC 0–24), which was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule. However, for 1-NMN, the AUC was calculated from time zero to 12 hours postdose because plasma concentrations of 1-NMN showed significant intraday variation. The AUC during 12–24 hours was determined only at two timepoints (12 and 24 hours), potentially impacting the interpretation of CLr.

The CLr regarding the plasma concentration of test compounds was determined by dividing the amount excreted into the urine from 0 to 24 hours (X urine) by the AUC value. For 1-NMN, AUC and the amount excreted into the urine from 0 to 12 hours were used. K i, app (apparent inhibition constant of pyrimethamine as the total concentration) and f PYR (the fraction sensitive to inhibition by pyrimethamine) were obtained by an iterative nonlinear least squares method using Prism8 version 8.4.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The following equation under the constraint of 0 < K i, app < ∞ was used, where C av represents the mean plasma concentrations of pyrimethamine in each subject. C av was obtained by dividing AUC pyrimethamine by the duration time (12 hours for 1-NMN, otherwise 24 hours).

- **Statistical analysis**: Natural log-transformed values of all parameters were analyzed by cohort using a mixed-effect model, with treatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (test-reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC and CLr were obtained.

### Oral glucose tolerance test: An informative endpoint or an added burden in metformin drug-drug interaction studies [^115GjPgi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

As of February 2, 2022, there were a total of 17 metformin drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies that included oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) assessments reported in the University of Washington Drug Interaction Database (DIDB). Five of these 17 studies reported somewhat altered metformin pharmacokinetics due to interactions with the evaluated drugs, but no effect on metformin's OGTT response.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) increased metformin exposure by approximately 40% but had no effect on the OGTT response in healthy volunteers. Despite the lack of OGTT effect in healthy volunteers, the United States prescribing information (USPI) for bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide refers to metformin's prescribing information for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use with metformin.

Rifampin increased metformin exposure by 13% with no impact on metformin's OGTT response in healthy volunteers. The USPI of rifampin recommends using rifampin with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), as diabetes management may be more difficult with rifampin concomitant use because rifampin is known to alter blood glucose concentrations.

Whether an OGTT is performed or not in healthy volunteers, it seems that the pharmacokinetic DDI or other known relevant pharmacodynamic impact ends up being the driver of the label language, and lack of an effect on OGTT in healthy volunteers does not seem to contribute to informing the label. The other three studies showed small changes in metformin exposure by the perpetrator drugs, and no effect on the OGTT response was observed.

- **Outcomes**: The primary clinical outcome was a variation in blood glucose response of more than 20%, 2 hours after the oral administration of co-trimoxazole during the OGTT with co-trimoxazole, compared to the blood glucose response during the OGTT without co-trimoxazole. The secondary outcomes considered were a variation of more than 10% of the blood glucose response at any time after the administration of co-trimoxazole and a variation of the insulin secretory response during the OGTT with co-trimoxazole, compared to the OGTT without co-trimoxazole.

- **Statistical analysis**: Data was coded, entered, and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21.0 for Windows (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). We compared the absolute value of blood glucose response and C-peptide secretory response with the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^112QKfwL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The study enrolled 20 volunteers with an average age of 23 years (SD 2.0). The mean BMI was 22.3 kg/m² (SD 3.6), the mean fasting blood glucose was 4.89 mmol/l (SD 0.33), the mean alanine aminotransferase was 5.58 ui/l (SD 3.56), and the mean glomerular filtration rate was 110.5 (SD 32.8).

- **Variations in the glycaemic response during the control versus the test OGTT**: During the control OGTT versus the test OGTT, glycaemia changed from 4.83 mmol/l (SD 0.39) to 4.72 mmol/l (SD 0.28) at T0 (P = 0.667); from 8.00 mmol/l (SD 1.11) to 7.44 mmol/l (SD 0.78) at T30 (P = 0.048); from 8.00 mmol/l (SD 1.17) to 7.67 mmol/l (SD 1.00) at T60 (P = 0.121); from 7.33 mmol/l (SD 0.94) to 7.11 mmol/l (SD 0.83) at T90 (P = 0.205); from 6.78 mmol/l (SD 1.00) to 6.67 mmol/l (SD 1.00) at T120 (P = 0.351); and remained at 4.72 mmol/l (SD 1.39) versus 4.72 mmol/l (SD 1.56) at T180 (P = 0.747). The ratio of the area under the glycaemia curve during the control and test investigation was 96.7%, indicating a 3.3% decreased glycaemic response (P = 0.062). A decrease in glycaemia by more than 10% was observed in 6 out of 20 participants at T30, in 7 out of 20 participants at T60, and in 1 out of 20 participants at both T30 and T60.

Results are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1.

### Bactrim [^1145k1Sg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:
	- **Carcinogenesis**: Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day).
	- **Mutagenesis**: In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. In both in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.

Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay.

The combined effect of reduced function 22A1 genotypes and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) interacting drugs on the likelihood of metformin intolerance is significant. Individuals with one or no risk alleles who are not treated with a potential interacting drug serve as the reference group. Carriage of more than one risk allele or the use of interacting drugs is associated with intolerance. There is an additive effect for those with more than one risk allele who are also treated with interacting drugs, resulting in the greatest risk of intolerance.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^113kZ6k1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Cases of severe hypoglycemia were reported in HIV/AIDS patients receiving a high dose of the sulfonylurea co-trimoxazole for opportunistic infections. Whether co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose would induce similar side effects is unknown. We aimed to investigate the acute effects of co-trimoxazole at a prophylactic dose on glucose metabolism in healthy adults.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 20 healthy volunteers (15 males and 5 females) aged 23.0 (SD 2.0) years, with a mean BMI of 22.3 (SD 3.6) kg/m², all having normal glucose tolerance, hepatic, and renal function. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed with and without concomitant oral co-trimoxazole administered 60 minutes before the test. Blood glucose response was measured using a capillary test at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes following oral glucose load on the two occasions. C-peptide response was also measured. Absolute values of blood glucose and C-peptide, with and without co-trimoxazole, were compared using the Wilcoxon test.

- **Results**: During the OGTT without co-trimoxazole (control) vs. the OGTT with co-trimoxazole (test), the glycemia varied: from 4.83 (SD 0.39) mmol/l vs. 4.72 (SD 0.28) mmol/l at T0 (P = 0.667); 8.00 (SD 1.11) mmol/l vs. 7.44 (SD 0.78) mmol/l at T30 (P = 0.048); 8.00 (SD 1.17) mmol/l vs. 7.67 (SD 1.00) mmol/l at T60 (P = 0.121); 7.33 (SD 0.94) mmol/l vs. 7.11 (SD 0.83) mmol/l at T90 (P = 0.205); 6.78 (SD 1.00) mmol/l vs. 6.67 (SD 1.00) mmol/l at T120 (P = 0.351); and 4.72 (SD 1.39) mmol/l vs. 4.72 (SD 1.56) mmol/l at T180 (P = 0.747).

### Sulfatrim [^116ftdEo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the treatment and prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) presents unique challenges. AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to these medications in the same way as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, such as rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase values, is significantly higher in AIDS patients undergoing treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia compared to non-AIDS patients. Additionally, hyperkalemia is more prevalent among AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Adverse effects are generally less severe when these medications are used for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension in AIDS patients does not necessarily predict intolerance to subsequent secondary prophylaxis. However, therapy should be reevaluated if a patient develops a skin rash or any adverse reaction.

Administering high doses of trimethoprim, as in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, can lead to a progressive but reversible increase in serum potassium concentrations in many patients. Even recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia in patients with underlying potassium metabolism disorders or renal impairment.

### Metformin and exercise in type 2 diabetes: Examining treatment modality interactions [^117QWqA5]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of metformin on the acute metabolic response to submaximal exercise, researchers examined the effect of exercise on plasma metformin concentrations, and the interaction between metformin and exercise on the subsequent response to a standardized meal.

Ten participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited for this randomized crossover study. Metformin or placebo was administered for 28 days, followed by the alternate condition for another 28 days. On the last two days of each condition, assessments were conducted during a nonexercise day and on a subsequent exercise day. Exercise took place in the morning and involved a total of 35 minutes performed at three different submaximal intensities.

- **Results**: Metformin increased heart rate and plasma lactate during exercise (both P ≤ 0.01) but lowered the respiratory exchange ratio (P = 0.03) without affecting total energy expenditure. This suggests increased fat oxidation. Metformin plasma concentrations were greater at several, but not all, time points on the exercise day compared with the nonexercise day. The glycemic response to a standardized meal was reduced by metformin, but the reduction was attenuated when exercise was added (metformin × exercise interaction, P = 0.05). Glucagon levels were highest in the combined exercise and metformin condition.

- **Conclusions**: This study reveals several ways by which metformin and exercise therapies can affect each other. By increasing heart rate, metformin could lead to the prescription of lower exercise workloads. Furthermore, under the tested conditions, exercise interfered with the effectiveness of metformin in controlling post-meal glycemic response.

### Sulfatrim [^117MT2Fp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed for a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. If a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be

### Sulfatrim [^114ZbKia]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound, and metabolized forms. Additionally, sulfamethoxazole is present as a conjugated form. Metabolism of sulfamethoxazole occurs predominantly through N4-acetylation, although the glucuronide conjugate has been identified. The principal metabolites of trimethoprim are the 1- and 3-oxides and the 3'- and 4'-hydroxy derivatives. It is the free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim that are considered therapeutically active. Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma slightly decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim, but this effect is insignificant; moreover, trimethoprim does not affect the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function experience an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 µg/mL.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^111eAWRN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrates that 960 mg of co-trimoxazole reduces the glycaemic response within 90 to 120 minutes after administration, although no hypoglycemia was observed, likely related to the procedure. This reduction in glycaemic response is associated with an increase in insulin secretory response. Although our findings cannot conclusively prove or exclude co-trimoxazole-induced hypoglycemia at a prophylactic dose, we suggest that clinicians should be aware of the hypoglycemic potential of co-trimoxazole. Increased alertness is recommended, especially in patients receiving high doses, with comorbidities, or those who are polymedicated.

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^1119drwx]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past 50 years, the mechanistic basis for the potently synergistic action between TMP and SMX has been explained by an overly simplistic model. Hitchings first proposed that sulfa drugs such as SMX potentiate the action of TMP through inhibition of DHF accumulation, which enhances the interaction of TMP with its target DHF reductase. Several studies have confirmed key elements of this model. However, this model does not account for the ability of TMP to enhance microbial susceptibility to SMX.

Our findings reveal that TMP potentiates SMX activity through the disruption of a previously unrecognized metabolic feedback loop, and the cyclic mutual potentiation of these disruptions results in amplified depletion of the essential cofactor THF. These findings highlight the importance of metabolic pathway structure in understanding antimicrobial drug interaction and will enable the identification of additional pathways that can be explored for potently synergistic antimicrobial-based targeting.
