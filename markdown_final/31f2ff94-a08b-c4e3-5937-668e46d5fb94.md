## Question

Pharmacological prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pharmacological prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, including pre-exposure versus post-exposure prophylaxis and the evolving variant landscape. Then, I should verify which agents have credible evidence and how strong that evidence is. Next, I will examine guideline positions and any conditional recommendations. After that, I need to check special populations, especially immunocompromised patients. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, highlight what to avoid, and note knowledge gaps and monitoring needs, making sure I anchor each point to the best available sources and correct any outdated statements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't misframe the question. Pharmacologic prophylaxis includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent infection and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent disease after a known exposure; importantly, the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies is variant-dependent, and several previously active agents lost activity against Omicron sublineages, which materially changes current recommendations [^113gY6cf] [^112smbBw].

> I need to check which agents have the most compelling evidence for PrEP. Historically, tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) showed high-certainty reductions in symptomatic COVID-19 and low-certainty reductions in hospitalization in unvaccinated participants during pre-Omicron waves, but it is no longer authorized in the U.S. due to loss of activity against circulating variants, so it should not be used for PrEP now despite earlier efficacy data [^115PpdX8] [^113gY6cf] [^113zDMo1].

> Hold on, I should verify the current PrEP option. Pemivibart (Pemgarda) received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in 2024 for pre-exposure prophylaxis in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals aged 12 years and older who are unlikely to mount an adequate vaccine response, with the condition that regional variants remain susceptible; IDSA issues a conditional recommendation for its use in this narrow population, reflecting low certainty of evidence and the need to monitor variant susceptibility over time [^115jBbo3] [^116QiCc7] [^115mSDu3] [^114BhYSD].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for pemivibart because I initially thought there were no randomized data. I should correct that: the EUA was supported by immunobridging data and the phase 3 CANOPY trial, which informed the conditional recommendation; however, the certainty remains low and ongoing data are expected, so shared decision-making and variant surveillance are essential when considering PrEP with pemivibart [^114BhYSD] [^11291Ydv].

> Next, I should review PEP options. Casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV) previously showed high-certainty reductions in symptomatic COVID-19 and infection in unvaccinated populations exposed to susceptible variants, but its EUA for PEP was withdrawn in the U.S. due to loss of activity against Omicron; thus, it is not currently available for PEP in the U.S., though historical data explain why it was once recommended in guidelines [^115PpdX8] [^112smbBw] [^117B4CkF].

> I will now examine agents with negative or insufficient evidence so I don't overstate options. Hydroxychloroquine fails to prevent infection or disease in both PrEP and PEP settings and is strongly recommended against by IDSA and WHO due to lack of benefit and increased adverse events; similarly, lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended against for PEP based on RCT data showing no significant reduction in infection and more adverse effects, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has no evidence for PrEP/PEP and did not show benefit in a recent PEP RCT, reinforcing that it should not be used for prophylaxis [^115BsdrY] [^112iPQzz] [^1112UTda] [^1157XAY3] [^1131AvBi] [^111ZmpMb] [^1144iyCu].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. For moderately or severely immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and older who are unlikely to respond adequately to vaccination, pemivibart PrEP can be considered when variants are susceptible; for other high-risk but immunocompetent individuals, there is no approved pharmacologic PrEP, so vaccination remains the primary strategy and pharmacologic prophylaxis is not indicated outside trials or exceptional circumstances [^115mSDu3] [^115jBbo3] [^116QiCc7].

> I should double-check implementation details for pemivibart. It is administered as a single intravenous infusion with repeat dosing every 3 months if continued protection is needed, and it should be given at least 2 weeks after COVID-19 vaccination to avoid interference; prescribers must verify current variant susceptibility before ordering, as authorization is contingent on low prevalence of resistant strains nationally [^116QiCc7] [^1178YBgr].

> But wait, what about cost and access considerations that might change real-world uptake. Economic modeling suggests monoclonal antibody PrEP can be cost-saving at high effectiveness and low price, but high drug costs and variant-driven loss of activity have limited adoption; this strengthens the case for reserving PrEP for the highest-risk, immunocompromised patients and aligning use with current variant susceptibility data [^115MTvqx].

> Next, I should review what to avoid so we don't propagate ineffective strategies. Do not use hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ivermectin, or colchicine for COVID-19 prophylaxis outside of clinical trials; these agents either have negative RCT data or insufficient evidence for prophylaxis and are not recommended by major guidelines [^115BsdrY] [^1131AvBi] [^112cwGNR].

> I need to ensure I capture knowledge gaps and monitoring needs. Evidence for pemivibart in vaccinated or previously infected immunocompromised patients remains limited, and ongoing studies should clarify efficacy, safety, and durability; clinicians should track CDC variant surveillance to determine when pemivibart remains appropriate and when it should be withheld due to resistance [^111Xk2AN] [^111tD6bG] [^114z1Wx5].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. For PrEP, consider pemivibart only in moderately or severely immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and older who are unlikely to mount an adequate vaccine response, and only when regional variants are susceptible; for PEP, there are no currently authorized agents in the U.S. due to variant resistance, so management should focus on testing, masking, and early treatment if infection occurs; for all others, prioritize vaccination, boosters, and nonpharmacologic precautions rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis [^115mSDu3] [^115jBbo3] [^116QiCc7] [^112smbBw].

---

Pharmacological prophylaxis for COVID-19 is **limited to specific high-risk groups** and is not a substitute for vaccination. The only current option is **pemivibart (Pemgarda)** [^115jBbo3], a monoclonal antibody authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals aged ≥ 12 years [^115mSDu3] when variants are susceptible [^116QiCc7]. It is given as a single IV infusion every 3 months [^1178YBgr] and is not authorized for post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment [^116QiCc7]. Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are **not recommended** for prophylaxis due to lack of benefit or potential harm [^115BsdrY] [^1131AvBi]. For hospitalized patients, standard-dose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended to prevent VTE [^112cdgCV] [^1171fsLH].

---

## Current pharmacological prophylaxis options

### Monoclonal antibodies

Among monoclonal antibodies, **pemivibart (Pemgarda)** is the only agent currently authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals aged ≥ 12 years [^115jBbo3] [^115mSDu3] when circulating variants are susceptible [^116QiCc7]. It is administered as a single intravenous infusion every 3 months [^1178YBgr]. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) is no longer authorized in the U.S. due to **loss of activity against circulating variants** [^113gY6cf] [^113zDMo1].

---

### Antiviral medications

Regarding antivirals, **nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)** is not recommended for prophylaxis; evidence does not support its use for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis [^1164vcwq] [^1144iyCu]. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are likewise **not recommended** for prophylaxis due to lack of efficacy and potential harms [^115BsdrY] [^1112UTda].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting pharmacological prophylaxis

### Monoclonal antibodies

Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that **pemivibart reduces the risk of symptomatic COVID-19** in immunocompromised individuals, with a favorable safety profile [^notfound]. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab previously showed efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and hospitalizations, but its authorization was withdrawn due to variant resistance [^115PpdX8] [^113gY6cf].

---

### Antiviral medications

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir shows no significant benefit for prophylaxis in exposed individuals, including household contacts [^1164vcwq] [^1144iyCu]. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin likewise show **no benefit** and may cause adverse effects [^115BsdrY] [^113x9NHq].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Variant susceptibility**: The effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies depends on circulating variants; ongoing surveillance is essential [^114z1Wx5].
- **Limited access**: High cost and logistical challenges limit widespread use of monoclonal antibodies [^115MTvqx].
- **Lack of evidence**: Most antiviral medications lack robust evidence for prophylaxis [^1163FytM].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Agent** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pemivibart (Pemgarda) | Pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals | Conditional recommendation (IDSA) [^115mSDu3] |
| Tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) | Previously authorized; now withdrawn | Not recommended due to variant resistance [^113gY6cf] [^113zDMo1] |
| Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) | Prophylaxis | Not recommended [^notfound] |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Prophylaxis | Strongly against (IDSA, WHO) [^115BsdrY] [^1112UTda] |
| Ivermectin | Prophylaxis | Not recommended [^notfound] |

---

## Special populations

Immunocompromised individuals are the primary target for **pemivibart**, given their reduced vaccine response and higher risk of severe COVID-19 [^115mSDu3] [^1178YBgr]. Pregnant women should follow standard vaccination guidance; pharmacologic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended. Children are not currently eligible for pharmacologic prophylaxis outside of clinical trials.

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

- **New monoclonal antibodies**: Research continues into broad-spectrum antibodies effective against emerging variants [^115zAruS].
- **Antiviral development**: Efforts focus on developing antivirals with prophylactic potential [^115zAruS].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring prophylaxis based on individual risk profiles and variant exposure [^notfound].

---

Pharmacological prophylaxis for COVID-19 is **limited to pemivibart** for high-risk immunocompromised individuals, with ongoing research into new agents and strategies. Vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention, and pharmacologic prophylaxis is not a substitute.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fTn43]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We systematically assessed beneficial and harmful effects of monoclonal antibodies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment, and prophylaxis in individuals exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Methods

We searched 5 engines and 3 registries until November 3, 2021 for randomized controlled trials evaluating monoclonal antibodies vs control in hospitalized or non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19, or as prophylaxis. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, COVID-19-related death, and serious adverse events; hospitalization for non-hospitalized; and development of symptomatic COVID-19 for prophylaxis. Inverse variance random effects models were used for meta-analyses. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials were included: 20 in hospitalized patients (n = 8253), 5 in non-hospitalized patients (n = 2922), and 2 in prophylaxis (n = 2680). In hospitalized patients, monoclonal antibodies slightly reduced mechanical ventilation (relative risk [RR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.9; I² = 20%, low certainty of evidence) and bacteremia (RR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.92; I² = 7%, low certainty of evidence); evidence was very uncertain about the effect on adverse events (RR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02–1.67; I² = 77%, very low certainty of evidence). In non-hospitalized patients, monoclonal antibodies reduced hospitalizations (RR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.53; I² = 0%, high certainty of evidence) and may slightly reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22–1.01; I² = 33%, low certainty of evidence). In prophylaxis studies, monoclonal antibodies probably reduced viral load slightly (mean difference -0.8 log 10; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.39, moderate certainty of evidence). There were no effects on other outcomes.

Conclusions

Monoclonal antibodies had limited effects on most of the outcomes in COVID-19 patients, and when used as prophylaxis. Additional data are needed to determine their efficacy and safety.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### 2020 year in review: pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 [^116NUY9E]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has led to a pandemic of acute respiratory illness. Pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 have included treatments that target infection prevention, prevention of viral replication, reduce inflammation, and manage symptoms of respiratory failure caused by the disease. This is a review of key pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed articles from 2020.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 [^113oZNKo]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised patients aged ≥ 12 years at risk for progression to severe COVID-19 when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent.

### Prophylaxis for COVID-19: a systematic review [^1163FytM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

While the landscape of vaccine and treatment candidates against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reviewed systematically, prophylactic candidates remain unexplored.

Objectives

To map pre- and postexposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and medRxiv.

Study Eligibility Criteria and Participants

All studies in humans or animals and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations.

Interventions

PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19.

Methods

Systematic review and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of medRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCT outcomes since systematic review search completion.

Results

We identified 13 studies (from 2119 database records) and 117 RCTs (from 5565 RCTs listed in the registries) that met the inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n = 2) or reported on animal studies (n = 7), most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP, and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, anti(retro)virals or use of vitamins and supplements.

Conclusions

The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work. There is little evidence regarding other compounds, with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.

### Monoclonal antibody levels and protection from COVID-19 [^111ycVU8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Multiple monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective for both prophylaxis and therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we aggregate data from randomized controlled trials assessing the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We use data on the in vivo concentration of mAb and the associated protection from COVID-19 over time to model the dose-response relationship of mAb for prophylaxis. We estimate that 50% protection from COVID-19 is achieved with a mAb concentration of 96-fold of the in vitro IC50 (95% CI: 32–285). This relationship provides a tool for predicting the prophylactic efficacy of new mAb and against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, we compare the relationship between neutralization titer and protection from COVID-19 after either mAb treatment or vaccination. We find no significant difference between the 50% protective titer for mAb and vaccination, although sample sizes limited the power to detect a difference.

### 2025 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the treatment and management of COVID-19: pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vilobelimab for critical illness, and abatacept or infliximab for severe or critical illness [^111tQ3mc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

As the first part of several focused updates to the clinical practice guideline on the treatment and management of COVID-19 in adults, children, and pregnant people, developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the panel presents four new recommendations. These recommendations include pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised persons and treatment of severe or critical COVID-19. The panel's recommendations are based upon evidence derived from systematic literature reviews and adhere to a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

### Current pharmacological modalities for management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the rationale for their utilization: a review [^113bUNGL]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic which is putting strain on the health-care system and global economy. There is much pressure to develop both preventative and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections.

### Pharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review [^115EA7jr]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.

Observations

No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.

### Review of trials currently testing treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [^114uXfbU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

As COVID-19 cases continue to rise globally, evidence from large randomized controlled trials is still lacking. Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are being undertaken all over the world.

Objectives

We summarized all registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved studies.

Data Sources

Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were applied. We excluded withdrawn or cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19.

Participants and Interventions

No restrictions in terms of participants' age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced.

Methods

The registries were searched using the term 'coronavirus' or 'COVID-19' from their inception until 26 March 2020. Additional manual search of the registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarized and tabulated. Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing traditional Chinese medicine.

Results

In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and three studies examining both were retrieved. Finally, 214 studies were methodologically reviewed. Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomized (n = 150/198, 76%) and open label (n = 73/198, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (interquartile range 40–200). Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed.

Conclusions

Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summarized data on these trials will assist physicians and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for COVID-19 pandemic containment.

### Monoclonal antibody levels and protection from COVID-19 [^115ptFSK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Search strategy for studies of COVID-19 prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies

As also detailed in, we used the results of the systematic review performed by the Cochrane Team's on monoclonal antibodies to prevent COVID-19. Briefly, searches were performed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register from inception to 30 November 2022, for randomized controlled trials of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of COVID-19. We identified six studies. We extended this systematic review from 1 January 2022 to 31 January 2023 using a shortened randomized controlled trial-only search on PubMed following the same search strategy and identified no new studies. Our search identified five studies where treatment efficacy and monoclonal antibody concentration were reported for the same cohort (Table S1 and Table S2). These studies were in a mixture of true pre-exposure prophylaxis and peri-exposure prophylaxis settings (Table S1). Data were extracted from these independently by two authors (ES and SRK), and discrepancies were resolved through discussion (Supplementary Methods).

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guidelines — neutralizing antibodies authorization status: Tixagevimab/cilgavimab is therefore no longer authorized for use in the US until further notice by FDA. SARS-CoV-2 is expected to continue to evolve, and although the general trend has been towards increasing resistance to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, there have been instances in which new variants became more susceptible to existing anti-SARS CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Should this occur again, or should newly developed, more active neutralizing antibodies be authorized for prophylaxis, the panel will offer recommendations regarding use.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^114z1Wx5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older — is addressed as follows: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, while the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. Resources note that as the pandemic evolves, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge with varying susceptibility to available anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; for current information, please refer to the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker (Summary of Variant Surveillance), and information on pemivibart is included in the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Pemgarda). This section was last reviewed on 08/12/2024, and the last literature search was conducted 05/30/2024.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### SARS-CoV-2-neutralising monoclonal antibodies to prevent COVID-19 [^115PpdX8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are laboratory-produced molecules derived from the B cells of an infected host. They are being investigated as potential prophylaxis to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Objectives

To assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs, including mAb fragments, to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases on 27 April 2022. We checked references, searched citations, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs, including mAb fragments, alone or combined, versus an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of COVID-19. We excluded studies of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs to treat COVID-19, as these are part of another review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane RoB 2. Prioritised outcomes were infection with SARS-CoV-2, development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms, all-cause mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included four RCTs of 9749 participants who were previously uninfected and unvaccinated at baseline. Median age was 42 to 76 years. Around 20% to 77.5% of participants in the PrEP studies and 35% to 100% in the PEP studies had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19. At baseline, 72.8% to 82.2% were SARS-CoV-2 antibody seronegative. We identified four ongoing studies, and two studies awaiting classification. Pre-exposure prophylaxis Tixagevimab/cilgavimab versus placebo One study evaluated tixagevimab/cilgavimab versus placebo in participants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variant. About 39.3% of participants were censored for efficacy due to unblinding and 13.8% due to vaccination. Within six months, tixagevimab/cilgavimab probably decreases infection with SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.70; 4685 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), decreases development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.35; 5172 participants; high-certainty evidence), and may decrease admission to hospital (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.59; 5197 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tixagevimab/cilgavimab may result in little to no difference on mortality within six months, all-grade AEs, and SAEs (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life was not reported. Casirivimab/imdevimab versus placebo One study evaluated casirivimab/imdevimab versus placebo in participants who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, and Delta variant. About 36.5% of participants opted for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and had a mean of 66.1 days between last dose of intervention and vaccination. Within six months, casirivimab/imdevimab may decrease infection with SARS-CoV-2 (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0 to 0.14; 825 seronegative participants; low-certainty evidence) and may decrease development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0 to 0.27; 969 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether casirivimab/imdevimab affects mortality regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody serostatus. Casirivimab/imdevimab may increase all-grade AEs slightly (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.31; 969 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on grade 3 to 4 AEs and SAEs within six months. Admission to hospital and quality of life were not reported. Postexposure prophylaxis Bamlanivimab versus placebo One study evaluated bamlanivimab versus placebo in participants who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type. Bamlanivimab probably decreases infection with SARS-CoV-2 versus placebo by day 29 (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98; 966 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), may result in little to no difference on all-cause mortality by day 60 (R 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.70; 966 participants; low-certainty evidence), may increase all-grade AEs by week eight (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; 966 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may increase slightly SAEs (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.91; 966 participants; low-certainty evidence). Development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms, admission to hospital within 30 days, and quality of life were not reported. Casirivimab/imdevimab versus placebo One study evaluated casirivimab/imdevimab versus placebo in participants who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, and potentially, but less likely to Delta variant. Within 30 days, casirivimab/imdevimab decreases infection with SARS-CoV-2 (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.48; 1505 participants; high-certainty evidence), development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms (broad-term definition) (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.35; 1505 participants; high-certainty evidence), may result in little to no difference on mortality (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.43; 1505 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may result in little to no difference in admission to hospital. Casirivimab/imdevimab may slightly decrease grade 3 to 4 AEs (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.02; 2617 participants; low-certainty evidence), decreases all-grade AEs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; 2617 participants; high-certainty evidence), and may result in little to no difference on SAEs in participants regardless of SARS-CoV-2 antibody serostatus. Quality of life was not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

For PrEP, there is a decrease in development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms (high certainty), infection with SARS-CoV-2 (moderate certainty), and admission to hospital (low certainty) with tixagevimab/cilgavimab. There is low certainty of a decrease in infection with SARS-CoV-2, and development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms; and a higher rate for all-grade AEs with casirivimab/imdevimab. For PEP, there is moderate certainty of a decrease in infection with SARS-CoV-2 and low certainty for a higher rate for all-grade AEs with bamlanivimab. There is high certainty of a decrease in infection with SARS-CoV-2, development of clinical COVID-19 symptoms, and a higher rate for all-grade AEs with casirivimab/imdevimab. Although there is high-to-moderate certainty evidence for some outcomes, it is insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions. These findings only apply to people unvaccinated against COVID-19. They are only applicable to the variants prevailing during the study and not other variants (e.g. Omicron). In vitro, tixagevimab/cilgavimab is effective against Omicron, but there are no clinical data. Bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab are ineffective against Omicron in vitro. Further studies are needed and publication of four ongoing studies may resolve the uncertainties.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111G1xkn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022. This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers. We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. Subgroup analyses for equity Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4. Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified. No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^113x9NHq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial mortality. Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 1) treating people with COVID-19 on death and time to clearance of the virus; 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), and the COVID-19-specific resources www.covid-nma.com and covid-19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19, people at risk of COVID-19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID-19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT-interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate.

Main Results

1. Treatment of COVID-19 disease We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co-interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention-to-treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three-fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT-interval on electrocardiogram (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ-and-azithromycin arm; this included QT-interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4%) developed confirmed COVID-19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (very low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low-certainty evidence). One cluster-randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID-19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 or production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the two study arms.

Authors' Conclusions

HCQ for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out. These results make it less likely that the drug is effective in protecting people from infection, although this is not excluded entirely. It is probably sensible to complete trials examining prevention of infection, and ensure these are carried out to a high standard to provide unambiguous results.

### A SARS-CoV-2 variant ‑ adjusted threshold of protection model for monoclonal antibody pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 [^115Lv7N5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To conclude, an established ToP for a SARS-CoV-2–neutralising mAb could be used to extrapolate efficacy in pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 to new populations and/or new mAbs with comparable mechanisms of action. Our findings add to the evidence that nAb titres are inversely correlated with symptomatic COVID-19 risk and directly correlated with efficacy, and contribute to the development and validation of a suitable methodological approach to estimating a ToP that corresponds to a given expected level of efficacy. This ToP can then be used as a benchmark for inferring clinically relevant protection against any specific SARS-CoV-2 variant or mix of variants.

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cwGNR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials and observational intervention studies on a wide variety of repurposed drugs have been published at an unprecedented rate. However, current evidence is scattered and inconclusive due to heterogeneous study designs and settings. A well-designed systematic review and meta-analysis is warranted to summarise and scrutinise published findings and provide up-to-date evidence regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic agents in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Such a review may map the landscape of existing and future prophylactic candidates.

This review complements current guidelineson preventive drugs and three earlier comprehensive reviews, which were based on articles published in 2020 and early 2021. Further substantial evidence on mostly studied drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ivermectin and additional information on other repurposed drugs are warranted for guidelines update. Smit et al and Andrade et al conducted a systematic review of repurposed drugs used as prophylaxis for COVID-19. These findings did not describe the large heterogeneity in the existing data quantitatively using meta-analysis. Bartoszko et al focused their review on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only, without compiling real-world evidence from observational studies. Importantly, findings need to be differentiated between two different prophylaxis modes PrEP and PEP, because the timing and dosage of prescribing prophylactic agents may influence the preventive effect.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the primary prevention of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 diseases in adults. For the drugs that have been studied as both PrEP and PEP, we further carried out a subgroup analysis to investigate the differential preventive effectiveness of these drugs when used as PrEP or PEP.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guidelines — neutralizing antibodies for post-exposure prophylaxis (archived) note that the section was last reviewed and updated on 1/12/2023 and that the first two US FDA authorized anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody combinations, bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab, were found to be largely inactive against the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants, rendering these products no longer useful for either treatment or post-exposure prophylaxis; as a result, Emergency Use Authorization was withdrawn by the US FDA for both, leaving no available neutralizing antibody product for use in the United States for post-exposure prophylaxis. For areas of the world where a significant proportion of circulating variants retain susceptibility to at least one neutralizing antibody authorized for post-exposure prophylaxis, use could be considered, although data are scarce on how susceptibility reductions affect clinical efficacy.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in children [^113EKreV]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is common in children, and clinical manifestations can vary depending on age, underlying disease, and vaccination status. Most children will have asymptomatic or mild infection, but certain baseline characteristics can increase the risk of moderate to severe disease. The following article will provide an overview of the clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 in children, including the post-infectious phenomenon called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Currently available treatment and prophylaxis strategies will be outlined, with the caveat that new therapeutics and clinical efficacy data are constantly on the horizon.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19 infection [^112WJdTM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are quinoline derivatives used to treat malaria. To date, these medications are not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there are no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical studies or evidence to support their use in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are being studied alone or in combination with other agents to assess their effectiveness in the treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19. The effective use of any medication involves an understanding of its pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanism of action. This work provides basic clinical pharmacology information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and summarizes safety data from phase II and phase II/III clinical studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of azithromycin and chloroquine in combination. In addition, this work presents data describing the proposed mechanisms of action against the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 and summarizes clinical efficacy to date.

### 2025 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the treatment and management of COVID-19: pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vilobelimab for critical illness, and abatacept or infliximab for severe or critical illness [^114BhYSD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation, and in addition to immunobridging data, results from the phase 3 CANOPY trial are now available showing comparable effect estimates; although the certainty of the evidence may be affected by this newer data, the guideline panel concluded that the direction and strength of the recommendation would not change.

### AZD7442 (tixagevimab / cilgavimab) for post-exposure prophylaxis of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 [^115DuRU6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This phase 3 trial assessed AZD7442 (tixagevimab/cilgavimab) for post-exposure prophylaxis against symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

Adults without prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or COVID-19 vaccination were enrolled within 8 days of exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual and randomized 2:1 to a single 300-mg AZD7442 dose (one 1.5-mL intramuscular injection each of tixagevimab and cilgavimab) or placebo. Primary end points were safety and first post-dose SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive symptomatic COVID-19 event before day 183.

Results

A total of 1121 participants were randomized and dosed (AZD7442, n = 749; placebo, n = 372). Median (range) follow-up was 49 (5–115) and 48 (20–113) days for AZD7442 and placebo, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 162 of 749 (21.6%) and 111 of 372 (29.8%) participants with AZD7442 and placebo, respectively, mostly mild/moderate. RT-PCR-positive symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 23 of 749 (3.1%) and 17 of 372 (4.6%) AZD7442- and placebo-treated participants, respectively (relative risk reduction, 33.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -25.9 to 64.7; P = 0.21). In predefined subgroup analyses of 1073 (96%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative (n = 974, 87%) or missing an RT-PCR result (n = 99, 9%) at baseline, AZD7442 reduced RT-PCR-positive symptomatic COVID-19 by 73.2% (95% CI, 27.1 to 90.1) vs placebo.

Conclusions

This study did not meet the primary efficacy end point of post-exposure prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. However, analysis of participants who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative or missing an RT-PCR result at baseline support a role for AZD7442 in preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^1164vcwq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023. This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low-income countries and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed. We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in inpatient settings We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information. Subgroup analyses for equity For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity. For inpatients, the outcome 'all-cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age. No further equity-related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high-risk, unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Very low-certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all-cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes. No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects. There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

### COVID-19 pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and treatment strategy: urgent recommendations [^116wmTEH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not yet close to being over, more than 8 months after the first cases, but researchers are making great progress in fighting the disease. We have conducted a brief review of the geographic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19, the updated pathological findings, prognostic factors, and treatments for disease prevention and improvement of prognosis. Although hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have been recommended by some researchers, many clinical trials have failed to confirm any beneficial effect of these and other drugs on COVID-19, in terms of improved clinical status or reduced patient mortality. Currently, glucocorticoid is the only drug that reduces the mortality of COVID-19 in a randomized controlled trial; however, it is still necessary to establish the optimal timing of administration. It is also urgent to set up an international or national cohort to address the risk factors associated with infection, the natural history of COVID-19, including the disease type, surrogate markers for critically ill, long-term sequelae, and reinfection after exposure, identify responders to glucocorticoid, and establish optimal treatment strategies for disease control.

Pemivibart PrEP — conditional recommendation and research needs: The guideline panel issued a conditional recommendation for PrEP with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals, but due to limited clinical evidence the resulting net benefit remains unknown for adults and may be clarified when final randomized trial evidence is available, and it will remain unknown for patients aged 12 to 17 years since they were not included in the trial. Detailed data on the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis specifically in immunocompromised individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines are needed, and additional data regarding safety, serum neutralizing against emerging variants, clinical efficacy, and pharmacoeconomic analyses are needed.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — hospitalized severe COVID-19: The guideline panel suggests tofacitinib in addition to standard of care for patient hospitalized for severe COVID-19. Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with treatment with tofacitinib, patients should receive at least prophylactic doses of anticoagulants during their hospital stay. Patients who received JAK inhibitors should not receive tocilizumab or other immunomodulators as no adequate evidence is available for its combined use. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence was low due to concerns of imprecision, which recognized the limited number of events and concerns about fragility of the results in the group who likely would benefit the most (those requiring supplemental oxygen or oxygen through a high-flow device).

Hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis in contacts of those diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported HCQ versus placebo or no additional treatment with assessment for SARS-CoV-2 at day 14; two studies required a positive test and one allowed symptoms when a test was not completed, and outcomes included hospitalization, mortality, and serious adverse events. Hydroxychloroquine appears to have trivial or no effect on the development of symptomatic infection at day 14 compared to no HCQ (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.16). HCQ showed trivial or no effect on hospitalization (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.47, 2.12; three fewer to seven more hospitalizations in 1,000) and mortality (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.28; five fewer to two more deaths in 1,000). There was no difference in serious adverse events with HCQ rather than no HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.76), and additional side effects included QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal effects.

### Pemivibart (Pemgarda) [^115jBbo3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is PEMGARDA?

PEMGARDA is an investigational medicine that is used for pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg) who:

are not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who have not been known to be exposed to someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
have moderate-to-severe immune compromise because of a medical condition or because they receive medicines or treatments that suppress the immune system and they are unlikely to have an adequate response to COVID-19 vaccination.

PEMGARDA is investigational because it is still being studied. There is limited information about the safety and effectiveness of using PEMGARDA for prevention of COVID-19. The FDA has authorized the emergency use of PEMGARDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19 under an EUA. For more information on EUA, see the "What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? " section at the end of this Fact Sheet.

PEMGARDA is not authorized:

to treat COVID-19
to prevent COVID-19 after being around someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 (post-exposure prophylaxis)
when PEMGARDA is not expected to work against more than 90% of the SARS- CoV-2 variants in the US. Viruses can change over time (mutate) and develop into a slightly different form of the virus, called a variant.

### FDA authorizes REGEN-COV mAb for prevention for COVID-19… [^116ZMCiX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today revised the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV authorizing REGEN-COV for emergency use as post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in adults and pediatric individuals who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. REGEN-COV is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent COVID-19 before being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus — only after exposure to the virus. Health care providers should review the Fact Sheet for detailed information about the use of REGEN-COV for post-exposure prophylaxis.

REGEN-COV also remains authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, one of the most accurate laboratory methods for detecting, tracking, and studying COVID-19. An 81% reduction in confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases was observed with REGEN-COV compared to placebo at day 29 in cases who were RT-PCR negative and seronegative at baseline. In the overall trial population, there was a 62% reduction in RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the REGEN-COV group compared to placebo at day 29.

The authorized dose for REGEN-COV for both treatment and as post-exposure prophylaxis is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered together.
- For post-exposure prophylaxis, either intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection is appropriate. For individuals who remain at high risk of exposure to another individual with SARS-CoV-2 for longer than 4 weeks, and who are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to full SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, following an initial dose of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab, repeat doses of 300 mg of casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab once every 4 weeks are appropriate for the duration of ongoing exposure.

### Post-exposure lopinavir-ritonavir prophylaxis versus surveillance for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2: the COPEP pragmatic open-label, cluster randomized trial [^111ZmpMb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, no direct antiviral treatment is effective as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was repurposed as a potential PEP agent against COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic open-label, parallel, cluster-randomised superiority trial in four sites in Switzerland and Brazil between March 2020 to March 2021. Clusters were randomised to receive LPV/r PEP (400/100 mg) twice daily for 5 days or no PEP (surveillance). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a close contact of > 15 minutes in < 2 metres distance or having shared a closed space for ≥ 2 hours with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome is the occurrence of COVID-19 defined by a SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or a seroconversion) and ≥ 1 compatible symptom within 21 days post-enrolment. ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04364022); Swiss National Clinical Trial Portal: SNCTP 000003732.

Findings

Of 318 participants, 157 (49.4%) were women; median age was 39 (interquartile range, 28–50) years. A total of 209 (179 clusters) participants were randomised to LPV/r PEP and 109 (95 clusters) to surveillance. Baseline characteristics were similar, with the exception of baseline SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, which was 3-fold more frequent in the LPV/r arm (34/209 [16.3%] vs 6/109 [5.5%], respectively). During 21-day follow-up, 48/318 (15.1%) participants developed COVID-19: 35/209 (16.7%) in the LPV/r group and 13/109 (11.9%) in the surveillance group (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.44; 95% CI, 0.76–2.73). In the primary endpoint analysis, which was adjuted for baseline imbalance, the hazard ratio for developing COVID-19 in the LPV/r group vs surveillance was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.29–1.26; p = 0.18).

Interpretation

The role of LPV/r as PEP for COVID-19 remains unanswered. Although LPV/r over 5 days did not significantly reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in exposed individuals, we observed a change in the directionality of the effect in favour of LPV/r after adjusting for baseline imbalance. LPV/r for this indication merits further testing against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.

### COVID-19 drug discovery and treatment options [^115zAruS]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, and serious social and economic disruptions worldwide. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated older individuals with underlying diseases are especially prone to severe disease. In patients with non-fatal disease, long COVID affecting multiple body systems may persist for months. Unlike SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which have either been mitigated or remained geographically restricted, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated globally and is likely to continue circulating in humans with possible emergence of new variants that may render vaccines less effective. Thus, safe, effective and readily available COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. In this Review, we summarize the major drug discovery approaches, preclinical antiviral evaluation models, representative virus-targeting and host-targeting therapeutic options, and key therapeutics currently in clinical use for COVID-19. Preparedness against future coronavirus pandemics relies not only on effective vaccines but also on broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved viral components or universal host targets, and new therapeutics that can precisely modulate the immune response during infection.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^113tVwBm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment Approaches in COVID-19

Consistent with the "two-phase" framing of COVID-19 illness, it is anticipated that antiviral therapies will have their greatest benefit in early disease and that therapies targeting the host immune response will be beneficial later. That division is best expressed in terms of care setting (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care) and we follow this categorization in this update. We emphasize that among severely and critically ill patients, the most important therapy is high-quality, multidisciplinary supportive care.

The outpatient setting has proved difficult for generating evidence from clinical trials, largely because the large majority of those infected by SARS-CoV-2 have self-limited infection. Prior work suggests possible efficacy for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in preventing more severe illness among outpatients, although definitive trials have not been published to date. The combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, monoclonal antibodies that bind to overlapping epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, reduced viral load in nonhospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 compared with placebo. These antibodies target the receptor binding domain of the viral S protein, potentially blocking viral cell entry. Early hopes that such antibodies would limit hospitalizations and protect health systems have yet to be realized, although a recent study demonstrating a significant reduction in symptomatic infections after postexposure prophylaxis with bamlanivimab is encouraging. The large multinational COLCORONA trial suggested a modest decrease in hospitalization (number needed to treat, 71) with a prolonged course of colchicine, although the primary efficacy endpoint of death or hospitalization for COVID-19 was not met. To date, no other outpatient therapies have achieved even the modest evidential thresholds required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization.

### AZD7442 (tixagevimab / cilgavimab) for post-exposure prophylaxis of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 [^112n599h]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Participants were randomized 2:1 to a single 300-mg AZD7442 dose (one 1.5-mL injection of each mAb consecutively) or saline placebo (two 1.5-mL injections consecutively) intramuscularly on day 1 and monitored for safety for 1–4 hours post dosing. Participants were initially stratified into cohort 1 (aged ≥ 60 years living in LTCFs with occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in another resident or staff member) or cohort 2 (aged ≥ 18 years exposed to SARS-CoV-2 within a prespecified high exposure risk setting; Supplementary Material). A protocol amendment (v6.0, 12 March 2021) removed caps for cohorts 1 and 2 not to exceed 80% of the total participants, as recruitment of participants from LTCFs was judged no longer feasible with the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

Participants who received study intervention and became eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine could request to be unblinded (at any time) to consider COVID-19 vaccination and remain in the study (Supplementary Material).

Outcomes

The primary safety end point was safety and tolerability of a single intramuscular dose of AZD7442 vs placebo, assessed by adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), medically attended AEs (MAAEs), and AEs of special interest (AESIs). The primary efficacy end point was first incidence of post-dose SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR–positive symptomatic illness (hereafter referred to as symptomatic COVID-19) occurring before day 183, assessed 30 days after the 25th event had occurred. The day 183 time point was selected to coincide with the expected duration of the effect of AZD7442, based on modeling analyses.

Further details of end points and the analysis methods are provided in the Supplementary Material.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) prophylaxis — The guideline's rationale states there was no consistent evidence showing that 1 unit of high-titer CCP prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection among highly exposed persons; the CCP data are in contrast to data showing that monoclonal antibodies prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. It notes potential reasons for differences and limited data from only 1 CCP trial, and concludes that the AABB suggests against prophylactic CCP transfusion because there was no conclusive evidence showing the benefits of CCP in this setting.

Methods

Data sources

PROVENT (NCT04625725) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial that assessed the efficacy of a single intramuscular 300-mg dose of tixagevimab–cilgavimab compared with placebo (2:1 randomisation; N = 5197) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a reduction in incidence of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 with tixagevimab–cilgavimab compared with placebo in SARS-CoV-2–naive participants who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine. PROVENT recruited adults (≥ 18 years of age) with an increased risk of inadequate COVID-19 vaccination response or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Exclusion criteria included prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, receipt of a vaccine or biologic for prevention of COVID-19, or allergy to any component of tixagevimab–cilgavimab or placebo.

The SUPERNOVA main cohort study (NCT05648110) was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of sipavibart relative to comparator (1:1 randomisation; N = 3335) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. The study was ongoing at the time of this analysis. SUPERNOVA enrolled participants ≥ 12 years old who had a qualifying immunocompromising condition. Participants received a second dose of their original randomised study intervention (sipavibart or comparator) after 6 months. Originally the comparator arm comprised of only tixagevimab–cilgavimab; at the request of the regulatory authorities on June 14, 2023, the comparator was changed to placebo, leading to redosing in participants originally receiving tixagevimab–cilgavimab. The primary efficacy outcomes were symptomatic COVID-19 caused by any variant or by non-Phe456Leu–containing variants within 181 days of dosing. The primary analysis data cut was event driven, leading to longer follow-up for participants first receiving tixagevimab–cilgavimab (192.6 days) compared with those receiving placebo (146.2 days).

### Clinical considerations for special populations | COVID-19… [^1178YBgr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- There are additional considerations for specific people diagnosed with COVID-19. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Additional protection Pre-exposure prophylaxis medication is available for some people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Pre-exposure prophylaxis helps prevent COVID-19 but does not take the place of vaccination in people who are eligible to receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC recommends an updated COVID-19 vaccine for most adults ages 18 years and older. Parents of children ages 6 months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with a healthcare provider. Pemivibart is a monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis for people who:

- Are moderately or severely immunocompromised,
- Unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, and
- Meet the FDA-authorized conditions for use.

Pemivibart may provide another layer of protection against COVID-19 in addition to the protection provided through vaccination. It can be given at least 2 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Pemivibart is administered as a single intravenous infusion, over 60 minutes at a doctor's office or healthcare facility. If continued protection is needed, additional doses should be administered every 3 months. Pemivibart is still being studied and there is limited information about the safety and effectiveness of Pemivibart in preventing COVID-19. Treatment There are several therapeutics available, including:

- The oral antiviral medication ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir
- The intravenous antiviral remdesivir
- The oral antiviral molnupiravir These therapeutics are beneficial in this population for early treatment of COVID-19. Treatment is best initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 5 to 7 days after illness onset.

The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19. CP is recommended for patients with immunosuppressive disease or patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. CP may be administered in an outpatient or inpatient setting.

### A randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 [^113BjiSq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-19 PEP was published by David R Boulware and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the trial question was: what is the role of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19? In the COVID-19 PEP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the population was: 821 patients (424 female, 397 male). The inclusion criteria were adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19 at a distance of < 6 feet for > 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, current hospitalization, allergy to hydroxychloroquine, retinal eye disease, known glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, known CKD, structural or ischemic heart disease, personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome. In the COVID-19 PEP study, the interventions were: n = 414 hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days for a total course of 5 days) n = 407 placebo (matching folate tablet in an identical regimen). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or illness compatible with COVID-19 within 14 days (11.8% vs. 14.3%; ARD -2.4, 95% CI -7 to 2.2). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in hospitalization (0.2% vs. 0.2%;) Significant increase in symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (11.6% vs. 13.5%;) No significant difference in all new symptoms (13.8% vs. 14.5%; ARD -0.7, 95% CI -7.05 to 5.65). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in neurologic reaction (dizziness, irritability, vertigo), headache, skin reaction, fatigue, allergic reaction, dry mouth, or taste change. significant differences in side-effects (40.1% vs. 16.8%), nausea or upset stomach (22.9% vs. 7.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (23.2% vs. 4.3%). In the COVID-19 PEP study, the conclusion was: in adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19 at a distance of < 6 feet for > 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure), hydroxychloroquine was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or illness compatible with COVID-19 within 14 days.

### Efficacy and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LTrBu]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Some proportions of populations, such as immunocompromised patients and organ transplant recipients might have inadequate immune responses to the vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For these groups of populations, administering monoclonal antibodies might offer some additional protection. This review sought to analyze the effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab (Evusheld) as pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. We used specific keywords to comprehensively search for potential studies on PubMed, Scopus, Europe PMC, and ClinicalTrials.gov sources until 3 September 2022. We collected all published articles that analyzed tixagevimab-cilgavimab on the course of COVID-19. Review Manager 5.4 was utilized for statistical analysis. Six studies were included. Our pooled analysis revealed that tixagevimab-cilgavimab prophylaxis may decrease the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.15–0.40, p < 0.00001, I² = 75%), lower COVID-19 hospitalization rate (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07–0.24, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%), decrease the severity risk (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07–0.24, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and lower COVID-19 deaths (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.03–0.99, p = 0.05, I² = 72%). In the included studies, no major adverse events were reported. This study proposes that tixagevimab-cilgavimab was effective and safe for preventing COVID-19. Tixagevimab-cilgavimab may be offered to those who cannot be vaccinated or have inadequate immune response from the COVID-19 vaccine to give additional protection.

COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with pemivibart — ongoing trial and interim evidence: One ongoing randomized controlled trial is testing a single intravenous dose in adults at risk or with inadequate vaccine response, with results expected later in 2024; in the interim, indirect evidence sources were used including adintrevimab, prior anti–SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody studies, and immunobridging evidence. This is supported by the statements that a trial is evaluating "a single dose of 4,500 mg IV pemivibart" in "adults ≥ 18 years of age", that results are "expected later in 2024", and that the panel "relied on indirect evidence from an RCT of adintrevimab… previous studies evaluating other anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, and immunobridging evidence".

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent plasma for persons hospitalized with COVID-19. The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^1144iyCu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus Disease 2019

The prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections continues to be an important area of focus, particularly among high-risk populations, such as immunocompromised patients, who are less likely to derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccines. The results from an RCT of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir published in 2024 suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir does not have a role in postexposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. In that study, 2736 patients were randomized — within 96 hours of exposure to a household contact with COVID-19 — to receive placebo or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, with the incidences of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by day 14 being 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.4%, respectively, in the placebo group, the group receiving 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, and the group receiving 10 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. The baseline seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was > 90% in this study, which likely helps explain the low rates of household transmission seen and may have contributed to the lack of efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

### Chloroquine for COVID-19: rationale, facts, hopes [^115Wk6sE]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The tragedy of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to a desperate search for effective treatments. Chloroquine (CQ), an aminoquinoline used for many years for the prophylaxis and therapy of malaria and autoimmune diseases, has been put forward as a treatment option.

The fact that CQ is not patented and has been in clinical use for years is a major advantage. CQ has been shown to have antiviral effects in SARS, MERS, Ebola, and HIV infections, but without data showing clinical effectiveness. Does the current level of evidence suffice for prescribing CQ for COVID-19?

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111sDGw7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pemivibart pre-exposure prophylaxis rationale — monoclonal antibodies directed at the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been employed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for COVID-19, and animal models using the parent mAb adintrevimab have demonstrated the ability of these antibodies to inhibit viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, thereby reducing virus-induced pathology; an advantage of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb is its ability to provide protection for individuals who do not respond to vaccination, and this protection begins immediately after the infusion; the FDA previously issued an Emergency Use Authorization for tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) as pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19; however, as the pandemic progressed, new SARS CoV-2 variants emerged with reduced neutralizing susceptibility to various anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs in assays performed using infectious and pseudotyped viruses, and there is evidence that the results of in vitro neutralization assays can predict the efficacy of prophylactic or therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb activity.

### Pemivibart (Pemgarda) [^116QiCc7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of Authorized Use

PEMGARDA is not authorized for use:

-For treatment of COVID-19, or

-For post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in individuals who have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2.

PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, should receive COVID‑19 vaccination.
In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination.

PEMGARDA may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under State law to prescribe drugs.

PEMGARDA has been authorized by FDA for the emergency use described above. PEMGARDA is not FDA-approved for any use, including use for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.

### Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as pre-exposure prophylaxis [^115MTvqx]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs PrEP) prevents infection and reduces hospitalizations and the duration thereof for COVID-19 and death among high-risk individuals. However, reduced effectiveness due to a changing SARS-CoV-2 viral landscape and high drug prices remain substantial implementation barriers.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness of mAbs PrEP as COVID-19 PrEP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For this economic evaluation, a decision analytic model was developed and parameterized with health care outcome and utilization data from individuals with high risk for COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 infection probability, mAbs PrEP effectiveness, and drug pricing were varied. All costs were collected from a third-party payer perspective. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to December 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Health care outcomes including new SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalization, and deaths. The cost per death averted and cost-effectiveness ratios using a threshold for prevention interventions of $22 000 or less per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

Results

The clinical cohort consisted of 636 individuals with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age 63 [18] years; 341 [54%] male). Most individuals were at high risk for severe COVID-19, including 137 (21%) with a body mass index of 30 or higher, 60 (9.4%) with hematological malignant neoplasm, 108 (17%) post-transplantation, and 152 (23.9%) who used immunosuppressive medication before COVID-19. Within the context of a high (18%) SARS-CoV-2 infection probability and low (25%) effectiveness the model calculated a short-term reduction of 42% ward admissions, 31% intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and 34% deaths. Cost-saving scenarios were obtained with drug prices of $275 and 75% or higher effectiveness. With a 100% effectiveness mAbs PrEP can reduce ward admissions by 70%, ICU admissions by 97%, and deaths by 92%. Drug prices, however, need to reduce to $550 for cost-effectiveness ratios less than $22 000 per QALY gained per death averted and to $2200 for ratios between $22 000 and $88 000.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, use of mAbs PrEP for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections was cost-saving at the beginning of an epidemic wave (high infection probability) with 75% or higher effectiveness and drug price of $275. These results are timely and relevant for decision-makers involved in mAbs PrEP implementation. When newer mAbs PrEP combinations become available, guidance on implementation should be formulated ensuring a fast rollout. Nevertheless, advocacy for mAbs PrEP use and critical discussion on drug prices are necessary to ensuring cost-effectiveness for different epidemic settings.

### SARS-CoV-2-neutralising monoclonal antibodies for treatment of COVID-19 [^114FFigM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are laboratory-produced molecules derived from the B cells of an infected host. They are being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs for treating patients with COVID-19, compared to an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention. To maintain the currency of the evidence, we will use a living systematic review approach. A secondary objective is to track newly developed SARS-CoV-2-targeting mAbs from first tests in humans onwards. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and three other databases on 17 June 2021. We also checked references, searched citations, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Between submission and publication, we conducted a shortened randomised controlled trial (RCT)-only search on 30 July 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that evaluated SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs, alone or combined, compared to an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention, to treat people with COVID-19. We excluded studies on prophylactic use of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). Prioritised outcomes were all-cause mortality by days 30 and 60, clinical progression, quality of life, admission to hospital, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified six RCTs that provided results from 17,495 participants with planned completion dates between July 2021 and December 2031. Target sample sizes varied from 1020 to 10,000 participants. Average age was 42 to 53 years across four studies of non-hospitalised participants, and 61 years in two studies of hospitalised participants. Non-hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 Four studies evaluated single agents bamlanivimab (N = 465), sotrovimab (N = 868), regdanvimab (N = 307), and combinations of bamlanivimab/etesevimab (N = 1035), and casirivimab/imdevimab (N = 799). We did not identify data for mortality at 60 days or quality of life. Our certainty of the evidence is low for all outcomes due to too few events (very serious imprecision). Bamlanivimab compared to placebo No deaths occurred in the study by day 29. There were nine people admitted to hospital by day 29 out of 156 in the placebo group compared with one out of 101 in the group treated with 0.7 g bamlanivimab (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.33), 2 from 107 in the group treated with 2.8 g (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.47) and 2 from 101 in the group treated with 7.0 g (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.56). Treatment with 0.7 g, 2.8 g and 7.0 g bamlanivimab may have similar rates of AEs as placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.50; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.38; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.27). The effect on SAEs is uncertain. Clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Bamlanivimab/etesevimab compared to placebo There were 10 deaths in the placebo group and none in bamlanivimab/etesevimab group by day 30 (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81). Bamlanivimab/etesevimab may decrease hospital admission by day 29 (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), may result in a slight increase in any grade AEs (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.59) and may increase SAEs (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.37). Clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Casirivimab/imdevimab compared to placebo Casirivimab/imdevimab may reduce hospital admissions or death (2.4 g: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.19; 8.0 g: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79). We are uncertain of the effect on grades 3–4 AEs (2.4 g: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.37; 8.0 g: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.73) and SAEs (2.4 g: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.37; 8.0 g: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.65). Mortality by day 30 and clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Sotrovimab compared to placebo We are uncertain whether sotrovimab has an effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.18) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement or death (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.76). Treatment with sotrovimab may reduce the number of participants with oxygen requirement (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.45), hospital admission or death by day 30 (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.48), grades 3–4 AEs (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.60), SAEs (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63) and may have little or no effect on any grade AEs (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16). Regdanvimab compared to placebo Treatment with either dose (40 or 80 mg/kg) compared with placebo may decrease hospital admissions or death (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.42; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60, 206 participants), but may increase grades 3–4 AEs (RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 13.12; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.70). 80 mg/kg may reduce any grade AEs (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22) but 40 mg/kg may have little to no effect (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.43). There were too few events to allow meaningful judgment for the outcomes mortality by 30 days, IMV requirement, and SAEs. Hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 Two studies evaluating bamlanivimab as a single agent (N = 314) and casirivimab/imdevimab as a combination therapy (N = 9785) were included. Bamlanivimab compared to placebo We are uncertain whether bamlanivimab has an effect on mortality by day 30 (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) and SAEs by day 28 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.14). Bamlanivimab may have little to no effect on time to hospital discharge (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.20) and mortality by day 90 (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.43). The effect of bamlanivimab on the development of severe symptoms at day 5 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.85) is uncertain. Bamlanivimab may increase grades 3–4 AEs at day 28 (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.98). We assessed the evidence as low certainty for all outcomes due to serious imprecision, and very low certainty for severe symptoms because of additional concerns about indirectness. Casirivimab/imdevimab with usual care compared to usual care alone Treatment with casirivimab/imdevimab compared to usual care probably has little or no effect on mortality by day 30 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.02), IMV requirement or death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04), nor alive at hospital discharge by day 30 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04). We assessed the evidence as moderate certainty due to study limitations (lack of blinding). AEs and SAEs were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for each comparison is based on single studies. None of these measured quality of life. Our certainty in the evidence for all non-hospitalised individuals is low, and for hospitalised individuals is very low to moderate. We consider the current evidence insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions regarding treatment with SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs. Further studies and long-term data from the existing studies are needed to confirm or refute these initial findings, and to understand how the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may impact the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs. Publication of the 36 ongoing studies may resolve uncertainties about the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19 and possible subgroup differences.

Introduction

The pandemic triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 6.8 million people in the US, with more than 200 000 deaths to date. The illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread broadly with significant effects on elderly and minority individuals, those with significant comorbidities, and members of the health care workforce. Public health measures to prevent COVID-19 disease have largely depended on physical distancing, use of facial covers and personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand hygiene. Health care workers (HCWs) assigned to treating patients with COVID-19 have frequent potential exposures, raising the question of whether pharmacologic prophylaxis is warranted.

Medication-based prevention and treatment of COVID-19 have proven challenging. To our knowledge, to date, only 2 medications, dexamethasone and remdesivir, have been shown to improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 disease, and no treatment has proven effective in mild to moderate disease. Furthermore, no pharmacologic prophylaxis for COVID-19 has been established. Given the many HCWs with substantial COVID-19 exposure worldwide, there is great interest in finding an effective medication to prevent viral transmission.

Hydroxychloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline with antimalarial and antiautophagic properties, has been identified as a possible prophylactic medication for SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used since its US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1956 for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and is generally well tolerated, with few long-term adverse effects. A recent randomized trial for postexposure COVID-19 prophylaxis with a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine did not demonstrate clinical benefit. However, the composite primary outcome measure for this study included symptoms consistent with infection without laboratory confirmation; most patients did not have assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), raising concerns of type II error from asymptomatic participants. We sought to test the hypothesis that administering daily hydroxychloroquine would prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital-based HCWs over 8 weeks of exposure via RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and serologic antibody testing from participants at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of treatment.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU recommendations — remdesivir, antipyretics, immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma, and anticoagulation: For adults with severe COVID-19 who do not require mechanical ventilation, we suggest using IV remdesivir over not using it, with the remark that remdesivir should ideally be started within 72 hours of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing; for adults undergoing mechanical ventilation for critical COVID-19, we suggest against starting IV remdesivir; for critically ill adults with COVID-19 who develop fever, we suggest using acetaminophen/paracetamol for temperature control over no treatment; in critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of standard IV immunoglobulin; for adults with severe or critical COVID-19, we suggest against the use convalescent plasma outside clinical trials; for adults with severe or critical COVID-19, we recommend using pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis over not using prophylaxis; and for adults with severe or critical COVID-19 and no evidence of VTE, we suggest against the routine use of therapeutic anticoagulation outside of clinical trials.

COVID-19 ICU VTE prophylaxis evidence — Although no RCTs evaluated efficacy specifically in COVID-19, meta-analyses in critically ill patients show pharmacologic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis reduces deep venous thrombosis (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63) and pulmonary embolism (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97) without increasing major bleeding (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.21). Several international guidelines recommend pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients, and evidence comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) includes a meta-analysis of three RCTs (n = 5188) and another meta-analysis of eight RCTs indicating LMWH reduces VTE risk without increasing major bleeding compared to UFH.
