Diaper rash fungal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fungal diaper rash, specifically its diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and distinguishing it from irritant diaper dermatitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially when and how to confirm candidiasis. Next, I will review first-line management, including barrier strategies and antifungal selection. After that, I need to check safety considerations, particularly around corticosteroids and systemic absorption. Finally, I will consider special populations, prevention, and when to escalate care, and I will close with a concise, practical algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its distinguishing features. Fungal diaper rash, most commonly due to Candida albicans, typically presents as a beefy-red, confluent eruption involving the perianal region, buttocks, and often the deep folds, with satellite papules or pustules at the periphery; this contrasts with irritant contact dermatitis, which tends to spare the folds and is more sharply demarcated at the diaper margins [^116zAFEX] [^1168cD8Y]. Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology: Candida complicates a substantial proportion of diaper dermatitis cases, with one series showing Candida in 77.4% of infants with diaper dermatitis, underscoring the need to consider antifungal therapy when features suggest yeast involvement or when the rash persists beyond 72 hours despite conservative measures [^112Jz5CL] [^116zAFEX].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure I do not overcall colonization as infection; a KOH preparation demonstrating pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast is the key diagnostic test to document candidiasis and justify antifungal therapy, whereas a positive culture alone may reflect colonization rather than infection [^113sbrwj] [^1168cD8Y]. Wait, let me verify the practical steps: gently scrape the active border or satellite lesions, prepare a KOH slide, and look for characteristic yeast forms; this is fast, inexpensive, and guides targeted therapy, especially when the rash is severe, recurrent, or refractory to barrier-based care [^1168cD8Y].

> I will now examine first-line management principles. The foundation is barrier protection and moisture control: frequent diaper changes, gentle cleansing with water or mild cleanser, thorough drying, and liberal application of a barrier ointment such as zinc oxide or petrolatum-based products at every change; this addresses the underlying irritant dermatitis that predisposes to Candida overgrowth [^112wz9va] [^112wz9va]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when antifungals are indicated: yes, barrier care remains essential and should be continued in parallel with antifungal therapy to restore barrier function and prevent recurrence [^113sbrwj].

> Now, I need to select antifungal therapy and confirm dosing. For documented candidal diaper dermatitis, topical antifungals such as miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or ciclopirox are appropriate; miconazole nitrate 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base (Vusion) is FDA-indicated as adjunctive therapy when candidiasis is documented by microscopy in infants 4 weeks and older, applied at every diaper change for 7 days [^113sbrwj] [^115TzYZx]. Let me double-check safety data: systemic absorption of miconazole from this 0.25% formulation is minimal, with most infants having undetectable plasma levels, supporting its safety in young infants when used as directed [^113HZndC] [^116NKd9b]. Alternatives like ciclopirox 0.77% suspension have also shown efficacy in open-label pediatric studies, though higher-quality RCT data are limited [^114bWszB].

> But wait, what about corticosteroids? I initially thought a low-potency steroid might help with inflammation, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. High-potency or even medium-potency steroids should be avoided in the diaper area due to occlusion and increased absorption; combination antifungal–steroid products such as clotrimazole–betamethasone are contraindicated in the diaper area and in children under 12 years for tinea, given risks of HPA axis suppression, skin atrophy, and masking of infection [^113f4CGC] [^11468Y76]. I should confirm exceptions: if a low-potency nonfluorinated steroid is considered for severe irritant inflammation, it should be used sparingly, for the shortest duration, and not in combination with antifungals in the diaper area, with close follow-up; otherwise, avoid steroids in suspected fungal diaper rash [^113f4CGC] [^116zAFEX].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In infants under 4 weeks, Vusion is not FDA-approved; if candidiasis is suspected in neonates, nystatin cream is a reasonable alternative, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for systemic involvement in premature or very-low-birth-weight infants, where cutaneous candidiasis can herald invasive disease [^113sbrwj] [^113uTdyG]. In immunocompromised children, including those with HIV, candidal diaper dermatitis is common and may be more severe; management principles are similar, but persistent or atypical cases warrant broader evaluation for systemic disease and coordination with pediatric infectious disease specialists [^117VVxBW] [^113EA96K].

> I need to ensure prevention is addressed, because recurrence is common. Breathable, superabsorbent diapers reduce moisture and Candida burden and are associated with lower rates of moderate-to-severe diaper dermatitis, including candidal involvement; caregiver behaviors such as frequent diaper changes, gentle cleansing, and prophylactic barrier use further reduce risk [^112B5DQZ] [^115XTyjH]. Let me reconsider the role of wipes: mildly acidic, fragrance-free wipes or water with soft cloths are preferred to maintain skin pH and barrier integrity, and robust cleaning after stooling with attention to intertriginous and perianal areas is particularly important [^115XTyjH] [^117G83X7].

> I should confirm when to escalate or reconsider the diagnosis. If there is no improvement after 7 days of appropriate antifungal and barrier therapy, I need to check for alternative diagnoses such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or nutritional deficiencies like zinc deficiency or acrodermatitis enteropathica, and consider KOH repeat testing, culture, or biopsy as indicated [^117Sx7aY] [^117Jx1mf]. Persistent, treatment-refractory diaper dermatitis, especially when diffuse and involving the whole perineum, has been associated with food allergy; in such cases, dietary evaluation and elimination may be necessary to achieve clearance [^112QkcfZ].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and verify alignment with evidence. Suspect fungal involvement when the diaper rash is beefy-red, involves the folds, has satellite papules/pustules, or persists beyond 72 hours despite barrier care; confirm with KOH microscopy; implement aggressive barrier strategies and frequent diaper changes; if candidiasis is documented, add a topical antifungal such as miconazole 0.25% at every change for 7 days; avoid corticosteroids in the diaper area and avoid combination antifungal–steroid products; reassess at day 7 and escalate evaluation if there is no improvement, considering alternative diagnoses and special populations as above [^116zAFEX] [^113sbrwj] [^1143Tp1x]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach matches both pathophysiology and regulatory guidance: yes, it integrates barrier restoration, targeted antifungal therapy, and safety constraints consistent with pediatric labeling and best-practice reviews [^113sbrwj] [^112wz9va].

Fungal diaper rash is best identified by **beefy-red, confluent plaques with satellite pustules** and involvement of the deep folds, distinguishing it from irritant dermatitis [^116zAFEX] [^1168cD8Y]. Confirm with a **KOH prep** showing pseudohyphae or budding yeast [^113sbrwj] [^1168cD8Y]. First-line treatment is a **topical antifungal** (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or nystatin) for 7–10 days, plus barrier creams and frequent diaper changes [^113sbrwj] [^1151tFF5]. Avoid **corticosteroid monotherapy** and combination steroid–antifungal creams in the diaper area due to risks of atrophy and masked infection [^1143Tp1x] [^11468Y76]. If the rash persists or recurs, reassess for alternative diagnoses, bacterial coinfection, or immunocompromise [^115zKRec] [^117Jx1mf].

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Fungal diaper rash typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Beefy-red, confluent plaques**: Often involving the perianal region, buttocks, and groin, with extension into the deep folds [^116zAFEX].

- **Satellite lesions**: Small, erythematous papules or pustules surrounding the main plaque, characteristic of Candida infection [^1168cD8Y].

- **Involvement of deep folds**: Unlike irritant diaper dermatitis, fungal diaper rash often involves the intertriginous areas [^116zAFEX].

- **Pruritus and discomfort**: Infants may exhibit irritability, crying, and sleep disturbances due to itching and discomfort [^112wz9va].

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, but confirmation can be made by microscopic examination of skin scrapings using potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, which reveals pseudohyphae and budding yeast [^113sbrwj] [^1168cD8Y].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors predispose infants to **fungal diaper rash**:

- **Prolonged moisture exposure**: Infrequent diaper changes and prolonged contact with urine and feces create a moist environment conducive to fungal growth [^117G83X7].

- **Antibiotic use**: Recent antibiotic therapy disrupts normal bacterial flora, promoting Candida overgrowth [^116zAFEX].

- **Immunocompromised status**: Infants with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to fungal infections [^notfound].

- **Poor hygiene practices**: Inadequate cleansing and failure to keep the diaper area dry increase the risk of fungal infection [^117G83X7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Fungal diaper rash must be differentiated from other common diaper-area dermatoses, including:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Irritant contact dermatitis | Erythematous, scaly rash sparing the deep folds | No satellite lesions; improves with barrier creams [^116zAFEX] |
| Seborrheic dermatitis | Greasy, yellowish scales; often involves scalp and face | Chronic course; responds to antifungal shampoos [^notfound] |
| Psoriasis | Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales | Chronic course; family history of psoriasis [^notfound] |
| Bacterial infections (e.g. impetigo) | Honey-colored crusts, bullous lesions | Positive bacterial culture; responds to antibiotics [^notfound] |

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management of fungal diaper rash involves a **combination of antifungal therapy, barrier protection, and hygiene measures**:

- **Topical antifungal agents**: Miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or nystatin creams are first-line treatments. Apply at every diaper change for 7–10 days [^113sbrwj] [^114bWszB].

- **Barrier creams**: Zinc oxide or petrolatum-based ointments provide a protective barrier, reducing moisture and irritation [^116a4e6i] [^112wz9va].

- **Frequent diaper changes**: Keep the diaper area clean and dry, changing diapers promptly after soiling [^117G83X7].

- **Gentle cleansing**: Use mild cleansers or water; avoid harsh soaps and wipes containing alcohol or fragrances [^116a4e6i] [^116F9gVD].

- **Avoidance of corticosteroids**: Corticosteroid monotherapy is contraindicated as it may worsen fungal infections and cause skin atrophy [^notfound].

---

## Prevention

Preventive measures focus on **minimizing moisture exposure**, maintaining skin barrier integrity, and reducing risk factors:

- **Frequent diaper changes**: Change diapers promptly after soiling to keep the skin dry [^117G83X7].

- **Barrier creams**: Regular use of zinc oxide or petrolatum-based creams prevents irritation and reduces fungal overgrowth [^116a4e6i].

- **Proper hygiene**: Gentle cleansing and thorough drying of the diaper area after each change [^117G83X7].

- **Breathable diapers**: Use of superabsorbent, breathable diapers reduces moisture and irritation [^112B5DQZ].

- **Limit antibiotic use**: Avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy to prevent disruption of normal flora [^notfound].

---

## Complications

If untreated or improperly managed, fungal diaper rash can lead to **secondary bacterial infections**, characterized by impetiginization with honey-colored crusts and purulent discharge. Chronic or recurrent cases may cause significant discomfort, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes in infants. Persistent fungal diaper rash may indicate underlying immunodeficiency or systemic disease, necessitating further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Parents should consult a healthcare provider if:

- The rash persists or worsens despite appropriate antifungal therapy.

- Secondary bacterial infection is suspected (e.g. honey-colored crusts, purulent discharge).

- The infant exhibits signs of systemic illness (e.g. fever, lethargy, poor feeding).

- The rash recurs frequently, suggesting underlying immunodeficiency or systemic disease [^notfound].

---

Fungal diaper rash is a common, treatable condition characterized by beefy-red plaques with satellite lesions. Accurate diagnosis and **appropriate antifungal therapy**, combined with barrier protection and hygiene measures, are essential for effective management and prevention of recurrence.

### Diaper dermatitis: a therapeutic dilemma. results of a double-blind placebo controlled trial of miconazole nitrate 0.25% [^1151tFF5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area, is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial compared the efficacy and safety of miconazole nitrate 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base with that of the ointment base alone in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants and evaluated the role of Candida albicans in the response to treatment. Infants age 2–13 months with diaper rash were treated with either miconazole nitrate 0.25% (N = 101) or ointment base (N = 101) for 7 days. Although improvement in rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3, 5, and 7, patients receiving miconazole nitrate 0.25% had significantly fewer rash sites and lower mean total rash scores on days 5 and 7 (p < 0.001). In the miconazole nitrate 0.25% group, improvement was most marked among those with moderate or severe diaper dermatitis at baseline and among patients whose baseline rashes were positive for C. albicans. Treatment with miconazole nitrate 0.25% was as safe as with ointment base alone. Miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment is a safe and effective treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review and brief survey of eruptions of the diaper area [^112gM6Dm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Eruptions in the diaper area are the most common dermatologic problem in infancy. Such eruptions can be subdivided into primary diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area with an ill-defined and multifactorial etiology, and secondary diaper dermatitis, a term which encompasses eruptions in the diaper area with defined etiologies. The most important factors in the development of primary diaper dermatitis are: (i) water/moisture, (ii) friction, (iii) urine, (iv) feces, and (v) microorganisms (sometimes). Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use and using disposable diapers, barrier creams, mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.

### Prospective aetiological study of diaper dermatitis in the elderly [^117JWeNR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The different causes of diaper dermatitis (DD) in the elderly are not well known and the treatment is often empirical.

Objectives

To determine the causes of DD in the elderly and to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal treatments in this indication.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with DD were included. Clinical evaluation, skin swabs for bacterial and mycological cultures, patch testing and skin biopsy were performed at inclusion. This was followed by 1 month of topical antifungal cream and, if needed, by oral fluconazole for the second month.

Results

Forty-six patients were included (mean age 85 years). Causes of DD were established for 38 patients: 24 had candidiasis (63%), six irritant dermatitis (16%), four eczema (11%) and four psoriasis (11%). After 2 months of treatment, 27 of 37 (73%) patients were cured and five of 37 were improved.

Conclusions

Mycoses and irritant dermatitis are the main causes of DD in the elderly, and emollient skin care and topical antifungal treatment can be considered a first-line therapy for this indication.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate intervention at this time?
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen
E. Tissue culture
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants — Correct. The most appropriate intervention at this time is barrier cream and avoiding further irritation. GGI typically resolves spontaneously over weeks to months with conservative management aimed at preventing irritation in the region. Caretakers should also be counseled on frequent diaper changes.
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Caution should be used in applying class I topical steroids to the diaper area because of the high risk of adverse effects, especially in the setting of an occlusive diaper. In addition, because of the controversial relationship between topical steroids and GGI, their use is not recommended.
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week — Incorrect. Ketoconazole 2% cream may be beneficial in treating candidal diaper dermatitis if it coexists with GGI, but that is not the primary process in our patient.
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen — Incorrect. Given the tendency for GGI to resolve spontaneously, holding off on obtaining a biopsy specimen is reasonable at this time in this infant. If the lesions fail to improve or the patient develops systemic symptoms, obtaining a biopsy specimen should be considered to rule out a more serious pathology.
E. Tissue culture — Incorrect. GGI is not an infectious process and therefore tissue culture would not be helpful.

### An update on diaper dermatitis [^115KTNrM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis leads to approximately 20% of all childhood dermatology visits. There have been several technologic advances in diaper design the last several years; however, due to the unique environment of the diaper area, many children continue to suffer from a variety of dermatologic conditions of this region. Common causes include allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, infection, and psoriasis. Treatments include allergen avoidance, barrier protection, parent education, and topical therapies.

### Case report: diaper dermatitis presenting as pustules [^1168cD8Y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. Its cause can often be determined clinically based on the clinical presentation. Primary diaper dermatitis is associated with irritants and spares the deep skin folds. Secondary diaper dermatitis is most often caused by Candida yeast overgrowth and typically presents as a well-defined area of beefy red erythema covering the diaper area and including the deep folds of skin with hallmark satellite pustules. Other causes include seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and, in the setting of a primarily pustular eruption, bacterial folliculitis. A simple potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) can confirm the diagnosis of candida diaper dermatitis and guide proper treatment.

### Topical therapy for dermatophytoses: should corticosteroids be included? [^113f4CGC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses, commonly known as ringworm or tinea, represent superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, which are among the most common infections encountered in medicine. The use of corticosteroid-containing combinations in dermatophyte infections that are usually treated with topical medications is still a much-debated issue. The addition of a corticosteroid to local antifungal therapy may be of value in reducing local inflammatory reaction and thus carries the theoretical advantage of rapid symptom relief in acute dermatophyte infections associated with heavy inflammation. However, the use of such combinations requires caution as they have some potential risks, especially with long-term use under occlusive conditions. Corticosteroid-induced cutaneous adverse effects have been reported primarily in pediatric patients due to inappropriate application of these preparations on diaper areas. Additionally, the corticosteroid component may interfere with the therapeutic actions of the antifungal agent, or fungal growth may accelerate because of decreased local immunologic host reaction, such that underlying infection may persist, and dermatophytes may even acquire the ability to invade deeper tissues. Analysis of the literature documenting clinical study data and adverse reactions related to combination therapy, drew the following conclusions: (i) combination products containing a low potency nonfluorinated corticosteroid may initially be used for symptomatic inflamed lesions of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, in otherwise healthy adults with good compliance; (ii) therapy should be substituted by a pure antifungal agent once symptoms are relieved, and should never exceed 2 weeks for tinea cruris and 4 weeks for tinea pedis/corporis; and (iii) contraindications for the use of these combinations include application on diaper or other occluded areas and facial lesions, as well as in children < 12 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients for any reason.

### The importance of skincare for neonates and infants: an algorithm [^116a4e6i]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The skin of neonates and infants undergoes a maturation process from birth and is susceptible to barrier disruption. The current algorithm follows a US-based consensus paper on skincare approaches using gentle cleansers and moisturizers in neonatal and healthy infant skin. This summary provides clinical information for pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, and pediatric healthcare providers treating neonates and infants.

Methods

The project used a modified Delphi process comprising virtual discussions followed by an online follow-up replacing the use of a questionnaire. During the virtual meeting, the systematic literature review results and a draft algorithm addressing over-the-counter skincare for neonates and infants with healthy skin were discussed and adopted using evidence coupled with the expert opinion and experience of the panel.

Results

The algorithm addresses three clinical signs: xerosis, erythema, and erosion/bulla. A growing body of evidence recognizes the benefits of ongoing daily use of non-alkaline cleansers and ceramides containing moisturizers to reduce inflammation and maintain a healthy skin barrier function. Diaper rash is common in infants presenting as erythema or, in more severe cases, skin erosion. Skin protection with a barrier cream and frequent diaper changes using disposable diapers resolves most cases; however, if the rash continuous despite appropriate care, rule out a candida infection.

Conclusion

The current algorithm focuses on neonatal and infant healthy skin that can benefit from skincare. When applied from birth onwards, gentle cleansers and moisturizers containing barrier lipids help maintain the protective skin barrier. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11):1195–1205. doi:10.36849/JDD.6219.

### Incontinence-associated dermatitis: not just babies [^1155ZybN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD) is frequently observed in young children but can affect individuals throughout their lifespan. The broader term incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is used to describe inflammatory skin reactions from prolonged exposure to urine and/or feces. This review compares IAD and IDD in pediatric and geriatric populations, focusing on their pathogenesis, clinical considerations, and management. Both conditions involve prolonged bodily fluid exposure disrupting the skin barrier, making infants and older adults particularly susceptible due to their age-related skin characteristics. Factors such as fecal enzyme activity and diet in infants, and medications and comorbidities in older adults, also influence presentation. Particularly for IAD in the geriatric population, accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other conditions like pressure injuries and intertriginous dermatitis is crucial. Management prioritizes prevention, which includes frequent absorbent product changes and barrier creams. If the condition develops, treatment varies with severity, from barrier applications for mild cases to topical steroids for severe cases. Antifungals or antibiotics may be required for cases with superimposed infections. Future initiatives should concentrate on overcoming the difficulties related to IAD and IDD, such as alleviating physical discomfort, mitigating economic impact, and developing standardized terminology and research specifically tailored to geriatric care.

### Differential diagnoses of diaper dermatitis [^115zKRec]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common contact eczema present in early childhood. The main cause is an irritant reaction to urine and feces, which is facilitated by the occlusive conditions under the diaper, leading to hyperhydration of the stratum corneum (diaper dermatitis). In addition, diaper pressure and friction can increase the risk of skin inflammation, which also opens the skin up to other irritant agents, allergens, and infectious agents, such as candida albicans. However, a variety of diseases are associated with inflammation of the skin in the diaper region, therefore the term "diaper dermatitis" is merely descriptive and does not reflect anything about the etiopathogenesis. The term diaper dermatitis refers only to an inflammation in the diapering area and should not be automatically equated with reactions to diapers. Making the correct diagnosis requires a thorough examination of the skin in its entirety and a detailed report of the patient's medical and family history. Once a specific pattern is identified, a precise diagnosis, and an appropriate therapy, can be determined.

### A multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans [^114bWszB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent. This open-label study investigated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans (C. albicans). Forty-four male and female subjects aged 6 to 29 months were included in the study. Study medication was applied topically to the affected diaper area twice daily for 1 week. Subjects were clinically evaluated at baseline and days 3, 7, and 14 (7 days post-treatment). Safety and efficacy variables included adverse events, mycological culture studies, KOH tests, Severity Scores, and Global Evaluation of Clinical Response. All adverse events were mild to moderate and considered not related to the study medication. Treatment provided statistically significant improvement (P < .05) for both the rate of mycological cure and reduction of Severity Score at each time point compared with baseline. Ciclopirox was safe and effective in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to C. albicans.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^113uTdyG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

At 1 week of life, the candidal rash was much improved, but an erythematous rash persisted on the trunk, extremities, and face. In addition, the infant developed oral thrush and erythema with numerous pustules in the diaper region, presumed to be a candidal diaper rash. It was recommended that oral nystatin of 2 mL PO QID be started for thrush and continue to apply nystatin 100,000 unit/g nystatin cream twice daily to all the affected areas, including the diaper region. Subsequently, small white papules appeared on bilateral palms, and nystatin cream was applied twice daily with resolution of papules after 2 weeks (Figure 1C).

### Symmetric red-purple papules in the diaper region [^113RXQWx]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most likely cause of this eruption?
A. Atypical mycobacterial infection
B. Clonal proliferation of lymphocytes
C. Fluorinated steroids
D. Irritant diaper dermatitis
E. Staphylococcal infection
A. Atypical mycobacterial infection — Incorrect. Despite having "granuloma" in its name, GGI is not caused by an infectious agent.
B. Clonal proliferation of lymphocytes — Incorrect. GGI does not represent a lymphoproliferative disorder.
C. Fluorinated steroids — Incorrect. The relationship between topical steroids, especially fluorinated formulations, and GGI is controversial. There are cases reported in which GGI worsened when treated with topical steroids. However, GGI is typically seen in patients with previous diaper dermatitis for which topical steroids may be used. This confounds their independent association with development of GGI.
D. Irritant diaper dermatitis — Correct. GGI is thought to be a sequela of primary diaper dermatitis, including irritant dermatitis and diaper candidiasis. Patients may present with GGI and primary diaper dermatitis concomitantly.
E. Staphylococcal infection — Incorrect. Staphylococcal species do not play a role in GGI.

### Prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis [^114nXbzT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition.

### Intertrigo and common secondary skin infections [^111ARxYD]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is inflammation of skinfolds caused by skin-on-skin friction. It is a common skin condition affecting opposing cutaneous or mucocutaneous surfaces. Intertrigo may present as diaper rash in children. The condition appears in natural and obesity-created body folds. The friction in these folds can lead to a variety of complications such as secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The usual approach to managing intertrigo is to minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powders such as cornstarch or with barrier creams. Patients should wear light, nonconstricting, and absorbent clothing and avoid wool and synthetic fibers. Physicians should educate patients about precautions with regard to heat, humidity, and outside activities. Physical exercise usually is desirable, but patients should shower afterward and dry intertriginous areas thoroughly. Wearing open-toed shoes can be beneficial for toe web intertrigo. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections should be treated with antiseptics, antibiotics, or antifungals, depending on the pathogens.

### Diaper (napkin) dermatitis: a fold (intertriginous) dermatosis [^116F9gVD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Diaper (napkin) dermatitis is an acutely presenting inflammatory irritant contact dermatitis of the diaper region. It is one of the most common dermatologic diseases in infants and children. In the past, the disease was thought to be caused by ammonia; however, a number of factors, such as friction, wetness, inappropriate skin care, microorganisms, antibiotics, and nutritional defects, are important. Diaper dermatitis commonly affects the lower parts of the abdomen, thighs, and diaper area. Involvement of skin fold regions is typical with diaper dermatitis. At the early stages of the disease, only dryness is observed in the affected area. At later stages, erythematous maceration and edema can be seen. Secondary candidal and bacterial infections can complicate the dermatitis. In the differential diagnosis of the disease, allergic contact dermatitis, intertrigo, psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, and the other diseases should be considered. Causes of the disease should be determined and eliminated primarily. Families need to be informed about the importance of a clean, dry diaper area and the frequency of diaper changes. The use of superabsorbent disposable diapers has decreased the incidence of the disease. Soap and alcohol-containing products should be avoided in cleaning the area. In some cases, corticosteroids and antifungal agents can be administered. If necessary, antibacterial agents and calcineurin inhibitors can also be beneficial.

### Erythematous scaly plaques with erosions in a 4-month-old [^113rHkc1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

History

A 4-month-old previously healthy full-term, exclusively breastfed male infant presented with a rash on the face, arms, and diaper area for 4 weeks. The patient was previously treated by his pediatrician with nystatin cream, ketoconazole cream, hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, and oral clindamycin without significant improvement. The family history was unremarkable. There were well-demarcated erythematous crusted plaques with focal erosions of the perioral, genital, and acral skin and scattered scaly erythematous plaques on the extremities (Fig 1, A-C). There was relative sparing of the upper cutaneous lip (Fig 1, A). Appropriate treatment resulted in rapid resolution in 2 weeks.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation and rapid improvement with treatment, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica
B. Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis
C. Transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD)
D. Infantile psoriasis
E. Langerhans cell histiocytosis

### A prospective two-year assessment of miconazole resistance in Candida spp. with repeated treatment with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment in neonates and infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis [^114kwWfk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A petrolatum and zinc oxide-based ointment containing 0.25% miconazole nitrate is reported to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis (DDCC). This prospective, multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase IV study investigated the potential resistance of Candida spp. to repeated topical use of 0.25% miconazole nitrate in infants age 15 months and younger with moderate to severe DDCC. For initial and recurring episodes of DDCC over the 2-year study period, subjects were treated with a 7-day course of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment (active components: miconazole nitrate 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum 81.35%) with a 7-day follow-up. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were conducted before treatment (day 0) and 7 days after treatment (day 14). Potential resistance to miconazole was defined using an arbitrary breakpoint of minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL. There was no evidence of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. after single or repeated treatment courses of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment. For the initial episode of DDCC, 83 of 168 subjects (49.4%) achieved a clinical cure, 77 (45.8%) achieved a mycologic cure, and 49 (29.2%) achieved an overall cure (clinical and mycologic). The overall cure rate for recurrent episodes of DDCC was similar to or numerically greater than rates observed for the initial episode. Treatment of DDCC with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was effective and generally well tolerated. No evidence of the development of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. was observed.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review of 63 children [^112Jz5CL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is a common infantile dermatosis with a highly variable prevalence and incidence. This study aimed to present the demographic and clinical features of babies with DD.

Methods

Data, including demographic and clinical features, obtained from DD patient forms were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The study included 63 babies with DD (female: n = 35 [55.6%]; male: n = 28 [44.4%]; mean age 11.6 mos). Most of the patients (43.5%) were 0 to 6 months of age. In all, 76.3% were breastfed, of whom 31.7% were exclusively breastfed. The number of previous episodes of DD was significantly lower in breastfed babies. The most common diaper area cleansing method was wet wipes (54.1%). Diaper creams were used in 86.2% of patients. DD was severe in 22.2% of patients, moderate in 57.4%, and mild in 20.4%. Candida infection was noted in 77.4% of patients. The median number of previous episodes of DD was significantly higher in patients with Candida infection than in those without (p = 0.02). Treatment yielded greater than 50% improvement (complete and moderate response) in 59.4% of patients at the first follow-up visit (3–5 days) and 82.6% at the second follow-up visit (10 days).

Conclusion

Most babies with DD were 0 to 6 months of age. Breastfed babies had fewer previous episodes of DD, so mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies to reduce the incidence of DD. Candida infection was common; clinicians should be aware of its association with DD.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^116PyBEM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fungal Infections

Fungal infections are also common in patients with AD, especially those caused by the commensal yeast Malassezia. Malassezia colonisation drives inflammation particularly in patients with seborrheic dermatitis on their head, neck, upper chest and back. Repeated exposure to Malassezia antigens induces autoreactivity to human proteins via molecular mimicry, leading to sustained skin inflammation. In a Japanese study, increased age and AD severity were associated with a higher prevalence and degree of IgE sensitisation to Malassezia antigens; Malassezia -specific IgE levels were higher in adults with AD compared with children.

Candida species, particularly C. albicans, are important fungal colonisers in AD. They mostly colonise the skin and mucosal surfaces of the body, such as the genitourinary tract, oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, causing vulvovaginitis, oral thrush and skin and diaper rash. Candida spp. infections can also lead to serious illnesses in individuals with a compromised immune system. C. albicans colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract results in antigen sensitisation, which may potentially lead to chronic AD. Moreover, abnormalities in the production of antibodies against C. albicans may have a role in AD pathogenesis.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113sbrwj]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VUSION Ointment is indicated for adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and /or budding yeast) in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance. (1.2)

1.1 	Indication

VUSION Ointment is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis only when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast), in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. A positive fungal culture for Candida albicans is not adequate evidence of candidal infection since colonization with C. albicans can result in a positive culture. The presence of candidal infection should be established by microscopic evaluation prior to initiating treatment.

VUSION should be used as part of a treatment regimen that includes measures directed at the underlying diaper dermatitis, including gentle cleansing of the diaper area and frequent diaper changes. VUSION should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes.

1.2 	Limitations of Use

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients, or in infants less than 4 weeks of age (premature or term).

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been evaluated in incontinent adult patients. VUSION should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, such as in an adult institutional setting, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113cGFMQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Clinical approaches to skin cleansing of the diaper area: practice and challenges [^116MSLv8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Cleansing and care of the diaper area require special consideration to maintain barrier function of the skin in this area and repair the barrier when it is compromised. Diaper dermatitis occurs commonly; understanding and modification of predisposing factors are imperative for caregivers. In this paper, we review important factors in diaper area care, including skin pH, the local microbiome, irritant and allergic potential of contactants, and application of topical agents.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^115TzYZx]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Study 1 was a double-blind, multicenter study in which VUSION was compared to the zinc oxide and white petrolatum combination treatment and included 236 infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, complicated by candidiasis as documented by KOH tests that demonstrated pseudohyphae and/or budding yeasts. Study medication was applied at every diaper change for 7 days.

The primary endpoint was "Overall Cure" and required that subjects be both clinically cured (total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection) and microbiologically cured (eradication of candidiasis). Primary efficacy was assessed 1 week following the end of treatment, at Day 14.

Study results are shown in the following table.

Two additional studies provided supportive evidence of the clinical efficacy of VUSION in infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, some of whom cultured positive for C. albicans. However, candidal infection was not documented in the culture-positive subjects, as microscopic testing (e.g. KOH) was not done. Therefore, the positive culture results may have reflected colonization rather than infection.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^1159T5Pt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials:

In clinical trials using multiple doses of cefpodoxime proxetil granules for oral suspension, 2128 pediatric patients (93% of whom were less than 12 years of age) were treated with the recommended dosages of cefpodoxime (10 mg/kg/day Q 24 hours or divided Q 12 hours to a maximum equivalent adult dose). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities in any of the patients in these studies. Twenty-four patients (1.1%) discontinued medication due to adverse events thought possibly or probably related to study drug. Primarily, these discontinuations were for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea, vomiting, or rashes.

Adverse events thought possibly or probably related, or of unknown relationship to cefpodoxime proxetil for oral suspension in multiple dose clinical trials (N = 2128 patients treated with cefpodoxime) were:

Incidence Greater Than 1%:

Diarrhea 6%

The incidence of diarrhea in infants and toddlers (age 1 month to 2 years) was 12.8%.

Diaper rash/Fungal skin rash 2% (includes moniliasis)

The incidence of diaper rash in infants and toddlers was 8.5%.

Other skin rashes 1.8%

Vomiting 2.3%

Incidence Less Than 1%: Body: Localized abdominal pain, abdominal cramp, headache, monilia, generalized abdominal pain, asthenia, fever, fungal infection.

Digestive: Nausea, monilia, anorexia, dry mouth, stomatitis, pseudomembranous colitis.

Hemic & Lymphatic: Thrombocythemia, positive direct Coombs' test, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis [^113YyJ1D]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous infection with Candida in neonates ranges from such common conditions as thrush and diaper dermatitis to serious diseases with potential for systemic involvement, including congenital candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis. In premature infants, seemingly benign mucocutaneous involvement may precede systemic infection and thus warrants thoughtful attention. Skin involvement also may be seen as an expression of systemic disease. The physical appearance of these lesions is often characteristic, allowing easy diagnosis. The patients at risk differ by gestational age and postnatal age at presentation. Systemic candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis typically occur in premature infants, particularly those with extremely low birth weight (≤ 1,000 g), whereas thrush and diaper dermatitis may occur in infants of any gestational age or birth weight. Congenital candidiasis presents at birth, while invasive fungal dermatitis typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of life, and thrush, diaper dermatitis, and systemic candidiasis may occur at any time in infancy. Controversy exists concerning optimal therapy of mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Mometasone furoate (Elocon) [^113WtMBs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from
equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS — Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued and
appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids
is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a
clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing
corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate
diagnostic patch testing.

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does
not occur promptly, use of ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued until the
infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the
following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for
external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for
which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped
so as to be occlusive, unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse
reactions.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use ELOCON Cream 0.1%
in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. ELOCON Cream 0.1% should not be applied
in the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing
(see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION).
This medication should not be used on the face, underarms, or groin areas
unless directed by the physician.
As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control
is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the
physician.
Other corticosteroid-containing products should not be used with ELOCON
Cream 0.1% without first consulting with the physician.

### Diaper rash… [^116zAFEX]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Irritant contact dermatitis and candida are most common causes. Irritant contact dermatitis typically spares the creases, while Candidafungal infections involve the creases, are beefy red, and may have surrounding papules at the periphery. Consider adding antifungal treatment for ICD when the patient has completed recent antibiotic course or if the rash has persisted longer than 72 hours. Moderate ICD can be treated with low-potency steroids; avoid mid-potency steroids because of increased steroid absorption from diaper occlusion

### Absorption and efficacy of miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment in infants with diaper dermatitis [^116NKd9b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The potential for toxicity from systemic absorption of topical miconazole in infants is a concern.

Objective

To assess the relative safety of 0.25% miconazole based on the amount absorbed through the skin of infants with diaper dermatitis after multiple applications.

Methods

Of 24 infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis, 19 received 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment and 5 received 2% miconazole nitrate cream for 7 days at each diaper change and after bathing. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and after 7 days.

Results

In the 0.25% treatment group, blood concentrations of miconazole were nondetectable (< 1 ng/mL) in 83% (15/18) and minimal (3.0 to 3.8 ng/mL) in 17% (3/18). Samples were missing for one patient. For the 5 infants in the 2% treatment group, miconazole concentration was nondetectable in 20% (1/5) and less than 7.4 ng/mL in 4 infants. No adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

Systemic absorption of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was minimal, demonstrating its safety in the treatment of moderate to severe diaper dermatitis.

### Innovative uses for zinc in dermatology [^113vC5PT]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Severe zinc deficiency states, such as acrodermatitis enteropathica, are associated with a variety of skin manifestations, such as perioral, acral, and perineal dermatitis. These syndromes can be reversed with systemic zinc repletion. In addition to skin pathologies that are clearly zinc-dependent, many dermatologic conditions (eg, dandruff, acne, and diaper rash) have been associated and treated with zinc. Success rates for treatment with zinc vary greatly depending on the disease, mode of administration, and precise zinc preparation used. With the exception of systemic zinc deficiency states, there is little evidence that convincingly demonstrates the efficacy of zinc as a reliable first-line treatment for most dermatologic conditions. However, zinc may be considered as an adjunctive treatment modality. Further research is needed to establish the indications for zinc treatment in dermatology, optimal mode of zinc delivery, and best type of zinc compound to be used.

### Diaper dermatitis: clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis [^117Jx1mf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A diverse group of diseases can cause skin conditions in the diaper area including those which are directly caused by diapers or the diaper environment, some which are not directly due to, but are worsened by, the wearing of diapers, and those which are independent of the presence of the diaper or its resulting environment. Many of these conditions are limited to this area of the skin, but others extend to skin outside this area, and some are signs of systemic disease. We review many of the important causes of eruptions in the diaper area and emphasize key points in the differential diagnosis.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113HZndC]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The miconazole component of VUSION is an antifungal agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. The mechanism of action of white petrolatum and zinc oxide for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The human pharmacodynamics of Vusion is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) for fungal pharmacodynamics].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The topical absorption of miconazole from VUSION was studied in immunocompetent male and female infants and children (n = 17) with diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast) ranging in age from 1 month to 21 months. After multiple daily applications to the affected area at every diaper change (approximately 5–12 times per day) for 7 days, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were below the lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.5 ng/mL in 15 out of 17 (88%) subjects. In the other 2 remaining subjects, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were 0.57 and 0.58 ng/mL, respectively at a single timepoint (4 hours after the last application) on Day 7.

12.4 	Microbiology

The miconazole nitrate component in this product has been shown to have in vitro activity against Candida albicans, an organism that is associated with diaper dermatitis. The activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans is based on the inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis in the cell membrane. The accumulation of ergosterol precursors and toxic peroxides results in cytolysis of the cell. In vitro minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test results for C. albicans isolates obtained from treatment failures in Clinical Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] does not appear to indicate that resistance to miconazole nitrate was the reason for treatment failure. The clinical significance of the in vitro activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans in the setting of diaper dermatitis is unclear.

### Diaper dye dermatitis [^111tqEZd]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is a common problem in outpatient pediatric office settings. Although most diaper rashes represent a form of contact dermatitis in response to irritants in the diaper environment, other rashes may be the result of an allergen in the diaper. On the basis of clinical examination results for 5 patients and patch testing results for 2 patients, we suspect that the patients demonstrated allergic contact dermatitis in response to the various blue, pink, and green dyes in diapers. Although topically administered corticosteroids are useful in the treatment regimen, the preferred treatment for allergic contact dermatitis in the diaper area is the use of dye-free diapers for allergen avoidance. Patch testing may also be valuable in identifying the allergen, because allergen avoidance is the key to prevention of recurrent disease.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^111tzDo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

For the outcome 'clearance of symptoms', which was stated in the protocol, we used instead the number of persons not cleared of symptoms, id est 'Failure to achieve complete resolution', because this best represents the treatment effect or lack of such an effect; for clarity we labelled the analyses.

For dichotomous outcomes such as the proportion of participants with lack of clearance of symptoms, we expressed the estimate of effect as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (Cl) at both short-term follow-up (up to four weeks) and long-term follow-up (more than four weeks). Thus, RR < 1 indicates a beneficial effect of the treatment. We expressed summary estimates of dichotomous outcomes as number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for statistically significant findings, when appropriate with 95% CI. We used the median control group risk in the comparison for NNTB calculations.

For continuous outcomes such as symptom scores for erythema, scaling and pruritus, we used the mean difference (MD) in summarising results. When similar outcomes were measured on different scales, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with its 95% CI.

Unit of analysis issues

We intended to analyse cross-over trials using techniques appropriate for paired designs, but the studies did not report sufficient data to facilitate this (see Description of studies).

We analysed studies with multiple treatment groups using pair-wise comparisons. When some studies compared an antifungal agent versus more than one control treatment, we considered each arm as a separate study comparing one active treatment versus one control treatment.

We avoided double counting of treatment and control groups of multiple treatment studies by equally dividing the number of control participants over the number of comparisons in the same meta-analysis.

Dealing with missing data

When we encountered missing data, we corresponded with study authors to request additional information. When data were reported only in figures, we extracted the data from the figures.

When standard errors were presented in figures, we recalculated these into standard deviations (SDs) using the RevMan calculator (RevMan). For studies in which SDs were not given, we calculated these from P values.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic, and judged heterogeneity between studies as considerable when the I² statistic was greater than 50%.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117VVxBW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candida infections — epidemiology and localized candidiasis in children with HIV infection notes that the most common fungal infections in children with HIV infection are caused by Candida spp., and candidiasis is characterized as either localized or invasive. Oral thrush and diaper dermatitis occur in 50% to 85% of children with HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) continues to be one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in children with HIV infection during the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era (28% of children), with an incidence rate of 0.93 per 100 child-years.

### Effect on skin hydration of using baby wipes to clean the napkin area of newborn babies: assessor-blinded randomised controlled equivalence trial [^114LMSh7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Assessment of trial outcomes

All initial measurements were taken in the hospital and follow up measurements were taken in the home. Our primary outcome measure was change in stratum corneum hydration scores on the buttocks from first assessment (within 48 hours of birth) to 4 weeks post birth, using a Corneometer.

Secondary outcomes comprised change in erythema measurements using a Mexameter (® MX 18); change in Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) using an Aquaflux (AF200), and change in skin surface pH (using a pH meter). Measurements were taken on the babies' buttocks at first assessment (within 48 hours of birth) and 4 weeks post-birth. Anatomical markers were used to ensure assessments were consistent. Two measurements were taken at each site; mean scores were used in analysis. Women were encouraged to cleanse the babies' buttocks and replace the napkin 30 minutes before the assessments were conducted. If the baby soiled the napkin within the 30 minutes prior to proposed assessment, the assessment was delayed for a further 30 minutes. Swabs of the peri-anal area were also obtained at 4 weeks to observe for between-group differences in the presence of microbial skin contaminants and irritants (Coliform bacteria and Candida species). Skin measurement instruments were calibrated prior to recruitment, during the recruitment period and following the last follow-up assessment to prevent measurement error.

Clinical measures included napkin dermatitis observed at first assessment and 4 weeks post-birth by the research midwife, and napkin dermatitis observed by the mother daily from first assessment to 4 weeks post-birth. A semi-structured diary was provided to all mothers; this included a Diaper Area Rash grading scale to aid the process. A set of reference photographs depicting the various levels of diaper rash were used alongside the scale to ensure consistency in clinical observations. Nappy cream usage was also recorded and a rescue treatment was pre-specified (Natusan Nappy Cream). Creams were weighed at the outset of the study and following the last assessment as an accurate measure of usage.

### Effects of breathable disposable diapers: reduced prevalence of Candida and common diaper dermatitis [^112B5DQZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Infants wearing breathable disposable diapers experienced significantly less diaper dermatitis (DD) compared to infants wearing standard, nonbreathable disposable diapers in a series of double-blind clinical trials. Severe DD, including confirmed infection with Candida albicans, was reduced by 38–50% among infants wearing highly breathable (HB) diapers. The prevalence of DD was inversely related to the breathability of the garments. The inhibitory effect of breathable diapers on the survival of Candida was further confirmed in controlled experiments with adult volunteers. A suspension of C. albicans cells was applied to delineated sites on the volar forearm. Each site was then covered by a full-thickness patch from either an HB or a standard diaper. Survival of Candida colonies was reduced by almost two-thirds in the breathable diaper-covered sites compared to the control sites.

### Diaper dermatitis-frequency and contributory factors in hospital attending children [^116EcTbX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of diaper dermatitis varies widely between published studies. It is a condition which causes considerable parental anxiety. To better understand the frequency of diaper dermatitis, treatment practices, and the current importance of previously identified etiologic factors, a questionnaire survey of parents who had children wearing diapers (n = 532) attending a large United Kingdom district general hospital was undertaken. At the time of survey, only 16% of the study population had diaper dermatitis. Forty-eight percent of the study population had never had an episode of diaper dermatitis. In a multivariate analysis, current diaper dermatitis was independently associated with four factors: presence of oral thrush, number of previous episodes, frequency of diaper changes, and diarrhea. Recurrent episodes of diaper dermatitis were associated with increasing age, lack of barrier cream use, current diaper rash, and frequency of diaper changes. In the majority of children with diaper dermatitis at the time of survey, treatment had been instituted in the community. Diaper dermatitis usually presents and is treated successfully outside the hospital setting and is not a common clinical problem in secondary care.

WASP (wait-and-see prescription) and observation in acute otitis media (AOM) — In a randomized emergency department study, 283 patients were assigned to a WASP or standard prescription and the primary outcome was whether the prescription was filled within 3 days of diagnosis; prescriptions were not filled for 62% and 13% of the WASP and standard prescription patients, respectively (P < .001), with reasons for filling in the WASP group including fever (60%), ear pain (34%), or fussy behavior (6%), and no serious adverse events were reported; strategies to observe children with AOM who are likely to improve on their own without initial antibiotic therapy reduces common adverse effects of antibiotics; In 2 trials, antibiotic therapy significantly increased the absolute rates of diarrhea by 10% to 20% and of diaper rash or dermatitis by 6% to 16%.

### Interventions for pityriasis rosea [^1141ZovC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pityriasis rosea is a scaly, itchy rash that mainly affects young adults and lasts for 2 to 12 weeks. The effects of many available treatments are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the management of pityriasis rosea in any individual diagnosed by a medical practitioner.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched five trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies, contacted trial authors, scanned the abstracts from major dermatology conference proceedings, and searched the CAB Abstracts database. We searched PubMed for adverse effects to November 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions in pityriasis rosea. Treatment could be given in a single therapy or in combination. Eligible comparators were no treatment, placebo, vehicle only, another active compound, or placebo radiation treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane. Our key outcomes were good or excellent rash improvement within two weeks, rated separately by the participant and medical practitioner; serious adverse events; resolution of itch within two weeks (participant-rated); reduction in itch score within two weeks (participant-rated); and minor participant-reported adverse events not requiring withdrawal of the treatment.

Main Results

We included 14 trials (761 participants). In general, risk of selection bias was unclear or low, but risk of performance bias and reporting bias was high for 21% of the studies. Participant age ranged from 2 to 60 years, and sex ratio was similar. Disease severity was measured by various severity indices, which the included studies did not categorise. Six studies were conducted in India, three in Iran, two in the Philippines, and one each in Pakistan, the USA, and China. The included studies were conducted in dermatology departments and a paediatric clinic. Study duration ranged from 5 to 26 months. Three studies were funded by drug manufacturers; most studies did not report their funding source. The included studies assessed macrolide antibiotics, an antiviral agent, phototherapy, steroids and antihistamine, and Chinese medicine. None of the studies measured participant-rated good or excellent rash improvement. All reported outcomes were assessed within two weeks of treatment, except for adverse effects, which were measured throughout treatment. There is probably no difference between oral clarithromycin and placebo in itch resolution (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.52; 1 study, 28 participants) or rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.44; 1 study, 60 participants). For this comparison, there were no serious adverse events (1 study, 60 participants); minor adverse events and reduction in itch score were not measured; and all evidence was of moderate quality. When compared with placebo, erythromycin may lead to increased rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 4.02, 95% CI 0.28 to 56.61; 2 studies, 86 participants, low-quality evidence); however, the 95% CI indicates that the result may also be compatible with a benefit of placebo, and there may be little or no difference between treatments. Itch resolution was not measured, but one study measured reduction in itch score, which is probably larger with erythromycin (MD 3.95, 95% CI 3.37 to 4.53; 34 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In the same single, small trial, none of the participants had a serious adverse event, and there was no clear difference between groups in minor adverse events, which included gastrointestinal upset (RR 2.00, CI 0.20 to 20.04; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials compared oral azithromycin to placebo or vitamins. There is probably no difference between groups in itch resolution (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.48) or reduction in itch score (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43) (both outcomes based on one study; 70 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicates there may be no difference between groups in rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.00; 119 participants). In these same two studies, no serious adverse events were reported, and there was no clear difference between groups in minor adverse events, specifically mild abdominal pain (RR 5.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 47.10; moderate-quality evidence). Acyclovir was compared to placebo, vitamins, or no treatment in three trials (all moderate-quality evidence). Based on one trial (21 participants), itch resolution is probably higher with placebo than with acyclovir (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94); reduction in itch score was not measured. However, there is probably a significant difference between groups in rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) in favour of acyclovir versus all comparators (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.53; 3 studies, 141 participants). Based on the same three studies, there were no serious adverse events in either group, and there was probably no difference between groups in minor adverse events (only one participant in the placebo group experienced abdominal pain and diarrhoea). One trial compared acyclovir added to standard care (calamine lotion and oral cetirizine) versus standard care alone (24 participants). The addition of acyclovir may lead to increased itch resolution (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.22 to 16.62) and reduction in itch score (MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.78) compared to standard care alone. Rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) was not measured. The trial reported no serious adverse events in either group, and there may be no difference between groups in minor adverse events, such as headache (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44) (all results based on low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When compared with placebo or no treatment, oral acyclovir probably leads to increased good or excellent, medical practitioner-rated rash improvement. However, evidence for the effect of acyclovir on itch was inconclusive. We found low- to moderate-quality evidence that erythromycin probably reduces itch more than placebo. Small study sizes, heterogeneity, and bias in blinding and selective reporting limited our conclusions. Further research is needed to investigate different dose regimens of acyclovir and the effect of antivirals on pityriasis rosea.

### Comparison of the effect of human milk and topical hydrocortisone 1% on diaper dermatitis [^116fJvgt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin problems in infants and children, affecting between 7% and 35% of infants. This randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy of hydrocortisone 1% ointment with that of human breast milk in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants ages 0 to 24 months. Infants with diaper rash were treated with either hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 70) or human breast milk (n = 71) for 7 days. Improvement in the rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3 and 7; there was no significant difference in total rash scores on days 3 and 7. Treatment with human breast milk was as effective as hydrocortisone 1% ointment alone. Human breast milk is an effective and safe treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^111qunoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

We pooled risk ratios for studies with dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or, when appropriate, standardised mean differences for studies with continuous outcomes using their weighted average for treatment effect as implemented in the RevMan software (RevMan). When heterogeneity was greater than 50%, we used a random-effects model. When heterogeneity was severe - I² statistic greater than 80% - we did not perform a meta-analysis but reported individual study results separately.

Grade

We used the programme GRADEPro to assess the quality of evidence across studies and to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for the most important comparisons that included a relevant number of studies. We started at a high level of quality because we included only randomised studies. We then used limitations in study design, consistency of results, directness, precision and publication bias to determine whether this should be downgraded by one or more levels. We reported our reasons for doing so as footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table and in Table 1. We considered the study design to have limitations when most of the studies in a comparison had unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, unclear allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessment.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis among HIV-positive participants with seborrhoeic dermatitis, but only one study included patients with HIV.

We conducted subgroup analyses based on conflicts of interest, dose and mode of delivery. These subgroup analyses were not planned in the protocol. Trial results were not presented in such a way as to allow subgroup analysis based on age, sex or presence of co-morbidity (significant co-morbidity was an exclusion criterion in many trials), as we had intended to do. Study factors (i.e. quality, design) that we had proposed as a basis for subgroup analysis were used instead for sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We attempted to carry out a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that we judged to have high risk of bias based on inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment or absence of blinding. However, we found too few studies on subgroup categorisation to effectively perform this. We deemed exclusion on the basis of accuracy of diagnosis (as stated in the protocol) as not worthwhile because most trials did not explicitly state whether the diagnosis was made by a physician. We dropped other criteria as stated in the protocol because they were not feasible (see Differences between protocol and review).

### Clotrimazole-betamethasone dipropionate prescribing for nonfungal skin conditions [^111BRE1V]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Visual inspection cannot reliably distinguish fungal rashes from nonfungal inflammatory skin conditions (eg, dermatitis, eczema). Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary antifungal use for nonfungal conditions or topical corticosteroid use for fungal rashes, potentially worsening infections. When rash causes are uncertain, physicians may prescribe topical antifungal-corticosteroid combination products, which are often less effective and more expensive than monotherapy for fungal skin infections, and whose overuse is likely associated with the global emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant dermatophytosis.

In the US, clotrimazole-betamethasone dipropionate is the most commonly prescribed topical antifungal-corticosteroid medication and is indicated to treat inflammatory dermatophytosis (ringworm). It is not recommended for use in persons younger than 17 years or intravaginally because betamethasone dipropionate is a high-potency corticosteroid. Recent clotrimazole-betamethasone use data in adults are sparse, but a single-center study including children and adults found only 38.1% of clotrimazole-betamethasone prescriptions were written for fungal diagnoses. We characterized clotrimazole-betamethasone prescribing in a large commercial health insurance database to identify potential physician knowledge gaps and improve patient treatment.

### Desquamative erythematous rash in a young woman [^1122eXCe]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Incorrect – the overall suspicion of cutaneous fungal infection was not high in this patient, especially with the morphology of superficial erosions associated with hyperesthesia and the absence of fungal elements on the skin biopsy histology.
B. Incorrect – Some may mistake the neck and chest rashes for the scarf/shawl sign in dermatomyositis, but the rash was not photo-distributed and it does not show violaceous erythema or poikiloderma. There were no characteristic associated features, such as heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules, periungual erythema, or myopathy.
C. Correct – The key to the correct diagnosis, in this case, is the combination of the morphology of an eruption of erythematous patches and plaques on her neck and flexures with superficial erosions and desquamative scales, coupled with the histologic findings of granular parakeratosis with upper epidermal pallor and history of eating disorder – suggesting an underlying nutritional disorder.
D. Incorrect – There was no history of any new contactants in this patient, thus patch testing would likely be unyielding. Furthermore, this would not address the underlying condition of nutritional disorder.
E. Incorrect – Although oral steroids may temporarily improve the dermatitis of a nutritional deficiency, it would not address the underlying cause of her dermatitis, thus it is not the most appropriate therapy.

### Invasive fungal dermatitis in a 770 Gram neonate [^111aKQiA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

A 770 g birthweight, 25-weeks gestation infant girl was born from a bigeminal pregnancy. Six days later she developed erythematous "diaper dermatitis" and maceration of the flexural areas. Despite topical antifungal therapy, erythematous plaques appeared 2 days later on the back. Within less than 24 hours, skin erosions with crusting appeared and spread over the whole body. Candida albicans was found in cutaneous scales, and blood, umbilical catheter, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. In spite of intravenous fluconazole therapy, her general condition deteriorated and she died 2 days later. This premature neonate had a typical case of invasive fungal dermatitis, which is characterized by diffuse erosive and crusting cutaneous lesions appearing several days after birth and a high rate of systemic fungal infection (mainly but not exclusively) due to Candida sp. Mortality is high and prompt diagnosis and initiation of antifungal therapy appears to be the most important factor for survival.

### Myths on chemical burns in the diaper area [^116HHcn2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past several years, a number of articles and online posts have circulated on the Internet associating use of disposable and cloth diapers with chemical burns on babies' skin. Because both mild chemical burns and diaper dermatitis (diaper rash) can cause skin redness and peeling, it is not surprising that some confusion has arisen regarding the association between these two conditions. However, diapers cannot cause chemical burns because they are made of inert materials. Diaper rash and chemical burns are distinct conditions that require different evaluation and treatment, which is why it is important for pediatricians to help parents understand the difference.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^117G83X7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Diaper Care

Diaper dermatitis is common, affecting most infants at least once 31. The occlusive diaper environment plays host to a complex interplay of potentially damaging factors. Alkaline urine disrupts the pH balance of the epidermis, which encourages microbial overgrowth and activation of fecal lipases, endogenous and exogenous proteases and bile salts, all of which can lead to further injury 32, 33. New recommendations were developed to provide guidance on routine care of the diaper area (Table 7).

Table 7
New Recommendations on Diaper Care

To reduce the risk of diaper dermatitis and manage the condition should it occur, it was strongly recommended that the diaper area be kept clean and dry and that diapers should be changed as often as necessary. The need to keep the diaper area dry was highlighted, as prolonged and excessive humidity can increase friction, lead to skin maceration, increase permeability, and encourage microbial overgrowth 34. Because excessive scrubbing and rubbing of the diaper area may promote irritation and further damage the barrier properties of the skin surface 24, 35, 36, it was strongly recommended that drying should be achieved through air drying or gentle patting with a dry towel or dry cotton balls/squares.

### Prospective trial for the clinical efficacy of anogenital skin care with miconazole nitrate-containing soap for diaper candidiasis [^115YtNuq]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anogenital skin care for the elderly remains an umbrella term concerning protective and non-interventional regimens, particularly for ordinary diaper users. Our recent investigation has demonstrated the preventive effect of daily anogenital washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap to the development of diaper candidiasis. We extended this work to cover our hypothesis as to whether the miconazole soap has a therapeutic benefit in genital candidiasis. The study outline includes: (i) the enrollment of 21 bedridden inpatients (84 ± 9 years; eight men and 13 women) who were diagnosed clinically and mycologically with genital candidiasis, and who had never received topical and/or systemic antifungal agents; (ii) administration of anogenital washing with 0.75% miconazole-containing soap once daily for 4 weeks; and (iii) assessment of clinical symptoms and detection of Candida materials by culture and microscopic examination. As assessed by clinical symptom scoring for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), the ratio of patients with severe to moderate symptoms dramatically decreased by 2 weeks and 10 of 21 patients became symptom-free at 4 weeks. The IAD clinical severity score was significantly decreased at 4 weeks. Compared with the baseline positivity, both microscopic and cultured Candida-positive rates were significantly decreased at 4 weeks after washing. All culture-detected fungi were Candida albicans. Severe adverse events did not occur in all participants. Individual medical and risk factors had no significant correlation with clinical severity and duration of candidiasis on variance analysis. In conclusion, topical washing with miconazole soap is a safe and reliable non-medical approach for soothing diaper-associated genital candidiasis in bedridden inpatients in whom it is difficult to perform prompt medical examination.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^111rw9Nt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated that the RH under the diaper was significantly lower for infants from China and the USA (perianal) compared with Germany. Higher RH in the diapered area may increase the risk of skin overhydration and could also impact microbiome diversity. This is consistent with previous research showing that diapers that maintain a lower humidity environment were associated with lower Candida albicans infection, a common contributor to DD. 24

While other factors may explain differences in DD prevalence and severity across regions, caregiver behaviors are likely a contributor. The rank order of DD severity across geographies was associated with less time spent in the same diaper overnight, greater prophylactic topical product use, and a robust cleaning routine after a stooling event. While not measured here, it is noteworthy that Chinese caregivers commonly leave the infant undiapered for periods of time, which may prevent skin overhydration. Chinese infants may also have greater individualized care, due to the common practice of numerous family members providing care for a single child. This could explain why Chinese caregivers changed the diaper more frequently during the night, and coupled with higher prophylactic topical product use, would reduce skin exposure to fecal irritants. Reported bathing frequency did not follow the rash rank order, with more frequent bathing reported in the USA and least in China. However, it should be noted that a common practice in China involves robust cleaning after stooling events in a water basin or sink. This practice would account for 2 "baths" per day based on stooling patterns.

### Diaper dermatitis: etiology, manifestations, prevention, and management [^112wz9va]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatricians and parents report diaper dermatitis (DD) to be one of the most common skin diseases that affects almost every child at some point during the early months and years of life. Diapered skin is exposed to friction and excessive hydration, has a higher pH than nondiapered skin, and is repeatedly soiled with feces that contains enzymes with high irritation potential for the skin. The combination of these factors frequently results in skin damage, leading to visible erythematous lesions that can be irritating and painful to the child. Behavioral changes such as increased crying and agitation and changes in eating and sleeping patterns indicate emotional distress. Appropriate skin care can help to prevent the occurrence of DD and to speed up the healing of affected skin. This includes frequent diaper changes and aeration, gentle cleansing, and the use of a barrier cream. Mild to moderate cases usually resolve after a few days of following this routine, but the use of harsh cleaning products can exacerbate DD.

### Evaluation of the impact of 2 disposable diapers in the "Natural" diaper category on diapered skin condition [^116aFqiQ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Diaper Dermatitis

DD, or diaper rash, severity was assessed at 4 diaper grading sites: perianal (anal groove), intertriginous (leg folds), genitals, and buttocks. Diaper rash was graded on post-baseline days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 28. Diaper rash assessment was scored using the P&G Diaper Rash Grading Scale, developed and used by Procter & Gamble, which ranks skin condition on a 7-point scale (0–3.0). Scores are based on the presence and intensity of erythema, erythema area of coverage, and presence of papules and pustules.

Rash assessed at a severity of "mild-to-moderate" (equivalent to a score of ≥ 1.5 on the Diaper Rash Grading Scale) was chosen based on the size of the study and rash incidence and severity observed in this population. Rash was analyzed based on 3 endpoints: (1) the percent of subjects with at least one score ≥ 1.5; (2) the percent of assessments with scores ≥ 1.5; and (3) the percent of subject with consecutive scores ≥ 1.5 at the same site.

Data Analysis and Statistical Methods

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who were randomized and experienced at least one application of the assigned study product. The per protocol (PP) population included subjects in the ITT population who had no serious inclusion/exclusion violations, no serious continuance criteria violations, no serious concomitant medication violations, and high study product compliance. The PP population was used for the primary analysis and for all diaper rash comparisons. Analyses of the ITT population was done to confirm the PP results and as the main data source for adverse event (AE) evaluations and summaries.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study data. Endpoints having to do with the proportion of subjects were analyzed with a χ² test. Endpoints having to do with the proportion of grading sites were analyzed with analysis of variance, where the response is the proportion of graded sites with skin marking score ≥ 2.0 or rash score ≥ 1.5.

### Topical breast milk plus zinc oxide versus zinc oxide alone for diaper rash in infants under 1 year: a randomized clinical trial [^113ZkLMs]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Diaper dermatitis (DD) is a common inflammatory skin condition in infants, typically managed with supportive care and anti-inflammatory treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical breast milk combined with zinc oxide versus zinc oxide alone in treating DD in infants. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Bahrami Children's Hospital from 2022 to 2023. Forty-two infants with clinically diagnosed DD were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group received 25% zinc oxide ointment, while the case group received 25% zinc oxide combined with topical breast milk. Both treatments were applied for 7 consecutive days. The severity of DD was assessed daily using the Buckley Diaper Dermatitis Severity Scale, and lesion improvement was documented. Results: The mean age of the infants was 2.93 ± 7.41 months, and 52.4% were male. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in baseline characteristics. Complete and partial recovery rates in the case group were 61.9% and 38.1%, respectively, compared to 66.6% and 19.1% in the control group. Notably, no non-responders were found in the case group, while 14.3% in the control group showed no response to treatment. The case group experienced faster lesion resolution (2.52 ± 0.67 days vs. 3.28 ± 1.14 days, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Topical breast milk combined with zinc oxide may reduce recovery time in treating diaper dermatitis. This approach is safe, cost-effective, and accessible. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm these results and establish standardized treatment protocols.

### Interventions for prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection [^116yT39J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### Effect of diaper cream and wet wipes on skin barrier properties in infants: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^114Bxram]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of different diaper care procedures on skin barrier function in infants has been minimally investigated and may be assessed using objective methods. In a single-center, prospective trial, 89 healthy 9-month-old infants (± 8 wks) were randomly assigned to three diaper care regimens: group I used water-moistened washcloths at diaper changes (n = 30), group II additionally applied diaper cream twice daily (n = 28), and group III used wet wipes and diaper cream twice daily (n = 31). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SCH), skin pH, interleukin 1α (IL-1α) levels, and microbiologic colonization were measured in diapered skin (upper outer quadrant of the buttocks), nondiapered skin (upper leg), and if diaper dermatitis (DD) occurred, using the most affected skin area at day 1 and weeks 4 and 8. Skin condition was assessed utilizing a neonatal skin condition score and diaper rash grade. On diapered skin, SCH decreased in groups II and III, whereas TEWL values were reduced in group II only. Skin pH increased in groups II and III. In general, SCH, skin pH, and IL-1α levels were higher in healthy diapered skin than in nondiapered skin. The incidence and course of DD was comparable in all groups. Areas with DD had greater TEWL and skin pH than unaffected skin areas. Infants who received diaper cream had lower SCH and TEWL and higher pH levels in the diapered area than on nondiapered skin. No correlation with the occurrence of DD was found.

### The history of diapers and their environmental impact [^112znb44]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Diapers nowadays

For the time being, disposable diapers are essential for baby care almost all around the world. An average child wearing diapers for the first 2.5 years will use between 6000 and 7000 disposable diapers. There have been a number of issues associated with disposable diapers as they have become more prevalent.

Diaper dermatitis is still one of the most common skin disorders affecting between 7 and 35 percent of infants at least once, and it is caused by various factors (chemical, physical, enzymatic, microbiological), not solely diapers. Through good hygiene practices and regular diaper changes, diaper rashes can be reduced, but not eliminated.

At this point in time, diaper disposal has both health and environmental consequences. There is no doubt that disposable diapers contribute significantly to landfill waste. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that single-use diapers are the third most common consumer item in landfills in the USA, and they take 500 years to biodegrade. As a result of these issues, both scientists and diaper companies are working to produce more environmentally friendly diapers.

### Differential diagnosis of diaper dermatitis [^1131eJVM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Mild diaper dermatitis often occurs in children before toilet training is complete, particularly from 9 to 12 months of age, and the most common presentation is an irritant contact dermatitis. Diaper dermatitis may account for up to 25% of dermatology visits to health care providers during the first year of life. Fortunately, since the introduction of hypoallergenic, superabsorbent modern disposable diapers, the incidence and severity of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis has decreased dramatically. Diaper dermatitis broadly refers to skin disorders that occur in the diaper area, such as skin eruptions triggered by diapers, rashes exacerbated by the diaper, and other events that occur in the diaper area. A number of skin conditions that can occur anywhere on the skin may present with distinctive findings in the diaper area. The following discussion will review the most common triggers of diaper dermatitis and contact irritant dermatitis, while focusing on the skin conditions that may be associated or overlap clinically with contact dermatitis.

### Diaper dermatitis that does not quit [^117F8u9C]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants. The humid, moist environment under the diaper makes the skin more susceptible to injury from exposure to irritants particularly related to urine and feces. A gentle cleansing routine, frequent diaper changes, and a thick barrier cream help control this condition. Irritant diaper dermatitis should be distinguished from other skin conditions that may develop in this sensitive area.

### Disposable diaper absorbency: improvements via advanced designs [^112gmezZ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Absorbency effectiveness in diapers has improved significantly in recent years with the advent of new ingredient combinations and advanced design features. With these features, many leading products maintain their dryness performance overnight. Considering the importance of holding liquid away from the skin, ongoing research in diaper construction focuses on strategies to increase the effectiveness to capture liquid and help avoid rewetting of infant skin. The layout and design of a disposable diaper allows for distribution of absorbency features where they can provide the optimal benefit. Clinical evidence indicates materials can keep moisture away from the skin in the diapered area, helping maintain proper skin hydration, minimizing irritation, and contributing to reduced rates of diaper rash.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^1143Tp1x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Important Administration Instructions

Inform the patient of the following:

Use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream as directed by the physician. It is for external use only.
Avoid contact with the eyes, the mouth, or intravaginally.
Advise patients to report any visual symptoms to their healthcare providers.
Do not use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the face or underarms.
Do not use more than 45 grams of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream per week.
When using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the groin area, patients should use the medication for 2 weeks only, and apply the cream sparingly. Patients should wear loose-fitting clothing. Notify the physician if the condition persists after 2 weeks.
Do not use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
Do not bandage, cover or wrap the treatment area unless directed by the physician. Avoid use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing.
Report any signs of local adverse reactions to the physician. Advise patients that local reactions and skin atrophy are more likely to occur with occlusive use or prolonged use.
This medication is to be used for the full prescribed treatment time, even though the symptoms may have improved. Notify the physician if there is no improvement after 1 week of treatment for tinea cruris or tinea corporis, or after 2 weeks for tinea pedis.

### Evaluation of the impact of 2 disposable diapers in the "Natural" diaper category on diapered skin condition [^113UZaAg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Diaper performance was evaluated in a parallel, randomized, examiner-blinded clinical study. The study was reviewed and approved by an ethics committee and all parents/caregivers provided written informed consent for their child. The study randomized 131 infants with 116 completing the study. Participants were stratified by baseline genital diaper rash score, current diaper product used, and sex. Following screening and enrollment, all infants wore a third-party store brand diaper (Parent's Choice) for a 7-day "washout" period to acclimate the skin to the same conditions and were provided a standard, marketed baby wipe (Pampers Sensitive Wipes) to use throughout the study.

Following the washout period, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 diaper products (Diaper A, Honest; Diaper B, Pampers Pure Protection), which were used exclusively for the 4-week study duration. Diaper A was chosen because at the time of the study it was the market leader in the "natural" diaper segment in North America according to sales. Diaper B was a new diaper enhanced with cotton and containing other thoughtfully selected materials.

In-Use Diaper Questionnaire

An at-home diary was used to assess leakage, wear time, and topical product usage. Parents/caregivers were asked to record all diaper changes throughout the study, along with the type of soiling (urine, feces, or both), if there was leakage, and the time between diaper changes. Parents/caregivers were also asked to record and track usage of any topical products (cream, lotion, or powder) throughout the study.

### Is the hip prosthesis responsible for this rash? [^114ascVq]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to a topical product
B. Allergic dermatitis related to a metal implant
C. Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)
D. Superficial fungal infection
E. Psoriasis vulgaris
Answers:
A. ACD to a topical product – Incorrect. ACD classically presents as a pruritic, well-demarcated erythematous patch, linear streak, or plaque with vesicles corresponding to the area of allergen contact. There was no history suggesting a topical contacted this site.
B. Allergic dermatitis related to a metal implant – Incorrect. Systemic contact dermatitis is the term used to describe a cutaneous reaction resulting from a systemic allergen exposure. Between 1% and 5% of patients receiving orthopedic metal implants have a cutaneous reaction caused by metal sensitivity, often overlying the prosthesis. Rates of metal sensitivity are higher in failed implants. Other diagnoses must be excluded before accepting this as the presumptive diagnosis.
C. ICD – Incorrect. ICD is the most common type of contact dermatitis and is the result of localized chemical irritation that is toxic to the skin. Clinically, it may mimic ACD but is usually accompanied by complaints of burning and stinging rather than pruritus. This lesion's defined border would be unusual in ICD.
D. Superficial fungal infection – Correct. Tinea corporis is a superficial dermatophyte infection involving the skin on the trunk or extremities and is typically limited to the stratum corneum. Classically, dermatophyte infections spread outward causing an annular lesion with central clearing and a moderate amount of scale as seen here. Diagnosis was confirmed by KOH preparation of scale scrapings, which showed hyphal elements.
E. Psoriasis vulgaris – Incorrect. Psoriasis is characterized by sharply demarcated plaques with thick white, micaceous scaling. It classically involves the scalp and extensor surfaces of adult patients. Koebnerization can initiate psoriasis, but this plaque is distant from the incision.

### Clinical evaluation of a diaper containing a shea butter-based emollient and impact on diapered skin erythema [^116uecTB]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The present investigation provides new evidence that a diaper manufactured with a petrolatum‐ or shea butter‐based emollient helps ameliorate erythema compared to a non‐emollient diaper. The results renew the skin benefits demonstrated for the PBE diaper in the context of today's improved diaper technology and provide new evidence for the SBE diaper, in which more babies were erythema‐free at the perianal site (2.8‐fold) compared to a non‐emollient diaper. The clinical study design mirrored real‐world conditions where babies may transition between two diapers with an emollient or from an emollient diaper to a non‐emollient diaper. Results from babies transitioning from the PBE diaper to the SBE diaper suggest parity in skin benefits (parity results), whereas babies who no longer receive the emollient experienced a significant increase in diaper area erythema. These data provide further evidence on the protective effects of emollients on skin and provide relevant information to caregivers and physicians on strategies to reduce the risk of DDA and lower the risk of infection due to diaper skin compromise.

Diaper dermatitis remains a common occurrence and a significant concern for parents and professionals as it is associated with discomfort/pain for babies, disrupts sleep, and can negatively impact behavior/temperament. Topical products are a mainstay of treatment, with data revealing 70% of caregivers in China, Germany, and the USA use topical products at least some of the time, and perianal dermatitis being the highest site of rash (66%–90% of babies). Thus, while disposable diaper and wipes technologies have improved since the 1980s, more advancements are still needed to reduce diaper skin irritation and improve diaper‐area skin condition. Skin application of emollients (like PBE and SBE) is logical, given both provide protection from irritants (SLS) and wetness in adult forearm studies (Supporting Information), two key mechanisms underlying skin irritation in the diapered region.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Setting the record straight on diaper rash and disposable diapers [^113XwFmE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Skin in the diapered area is continuously threatened by exposure to changes in pH levels, overhydration, mechanical friction, and fecal enzymes, making diaper rash a common occurrence among babies. Up to one third of infants may exhibit clinical symptoms of diaper rash at any time, and more than half of babies between the ages of 4 and 15 months develop diaper rash at least once in a 2-month period. Despite misperceptions that disposable diapers are related to an increase in diaper rash, the incidence of diaper dermatitis is on the decline, largely due to significant improvements in disposable diaper construction and materials. Modern-day disposable diapers are specifically designed to limit exposure to irritants in the diaper area, reduce overhydration, inhibit skin barrier compromise, and help maintain normal skin pH levels and have been thoroughly evaluated for safety and skin compatibility.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117L7THS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis aims to do the following.

Achieve remission of rashes.
Eliminate itching and burning sensations.
Reduce the severity of rashes.
Prevent recurrence of rashes.

A variety of drug and non-drug treatments have been tried for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably the most widely applied (Naldi). Various preparations are available for topical and oral application. Behavioural modifications such as frequent skin cleansing with soap, resolute commitment to personal hygiene and frequent outdoor recreation, especially in summer, have been found to lessen the symptoms (Johnson). Other therapeutic modalities include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione and coal tar, which are applied topically and function to soften and remove the thick hardened crusts that sometimes occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis (Schwartz). Recalcitrant cases of this skin problem have been managed with phototherapy (i.e. ultraviolet B phototherapy) (Naldi), as well as with isotretinoin therapy, which reduces sebaceous gland size and consequently sebum secretion (Johnson).

In this review, we have focused on the more widespread topical application of topical antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole and ciclopirox, which are available as ointments, creams, gels and shampoos (Gupta; Shuster).

How the intervention might work

Based on the concept that Malassezia yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis, antifungals have long been proposed as treatment that confers the same benefits as steroids but lacks associated adverse effects (Gupta). Antifungals can lead to inhibition of fungal growth, mainly by interaction with the fungal cell membrane through inhibition of sterol synthesis or inhibition of the synthesis of cell walls (Kathiravan). In accordance with their chemical structure, antifungals are usually divided into azole-based antifungals such as ketoconazole, allylamines such as terbinafine, benzylamines such as butenafine and hydroxypyridones such as ciclopirox (Ghannoum). Other drugs such as selenium sulphide or herbal agents and natural products such as honey have also been shown to influence fungal growth, but their mechanism of action is not clear (Gupta). In this review, we have selectively included herbal extracts that have well-documented antifungal properties.

### Widespread hyperpigmented rash present for 1 year [^112tv9eB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and obesity presented to the clinic for evaluation of a hyperpigmented rash located in her axillae, groin, buttock, umbilicus, and inframammary region (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig 5, Fig 6) of 1 years' duration. She reported pruritus and occasional fissuring after scratching. She was treated previously with nystatin powder, clotrimazole cream, and oral fluconazole for 4 weeks with minimal improvement.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Inverse psoriasis
C. Dermatophytosis
D. Erythrasma
E. Candidiasis

Answers:
A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides classically appears as patches. It takes years to develop and most cases occur in whites (70%; Hispanics, 9%).
B. Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect. Inverse psoriasis presents with erythematous, shiny, moist plaques in intertriginous areas but with no scale.
C. Dermatophytosis – Incorrect. Dermatophytosis often occurs with onychomycosis; lack of response to antifungals makes this diagnosis less likely.
D. Erythrasma – Correct. Erythrasma presents with erythematous to tan, asymptomatic or pruritic scaly plaques in intertriginous areas and is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Risk factors include obesity, poor hygiene, warm climate, and diabetes mellitus.
E. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Candidiasis has satellite papules and would have improved with antifungals.

6.1 	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

A total of 835 infants and young children were evaluated in the clinical development program. Of 418 subjects in the VUSION group, 58 (14%) reported one or more adverse events. Of 417 subjects in the zinc oxide/white petrolatum control group, 85 (20%) reported one or more adverse events. Adverse events that occurred at a rate of ≥ 1% for subjects who were treated with VUSION were approximately the same in type and frequency as for subjects who were treated with zinc oxide/white petrolatum ointment.

6.2 	Post-marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of VUSION. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting

### AGA clinical practice update on management of ostomies: commentary [^112aCKYq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Dermatological problems around ostomies — presentations, initial therapy, and when to escalate — most commonly arise from leaking around the appliance; patients may also develop allergies to the ostomy appliance, fungal rash, and/or folliculitis; antifungal powder can be sprinkled onto the skin and sealed with sealant, and if there is no improvement after 2 weeks, patients should be evaluated further by a surgeon or enterostomal therapist; patients with painful ulcers surrounded by a purple halo should be assessed for possible peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum; a small amount of bleeding during appliance changes is normal, but if bleeding persists or becomes severe, a work-up for peristomal varices should be considered, typically characterized by a purplish, concentric discoloration around the ostomy.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^115XTyjH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical products are widely recommended for DD, and use was reported by > 70% of caregivers in this study. Prophylactic use was highest in China, but similar between the USA and Germany. While it is likely that prophylactic topical products were used to suppress rash, occasional use is difficult to interpret, since these products can also be used as medical treatments. The advantage of prophylactic cream/ointment use is supported by a reduction in DD in infants wearing diapers containing emollients with or without zinc oxide. 16, 17

Of the geographies studied, the USA and Germany had the most similar habits and practices. Lower DD observed in the USA compared with Germany was associated with higher packaged wipes usage, more frequent overnight diaper changes, and greater bathing frequency. These practices are consistent with current USA and European physician‐led organization recommendations: using superabsorbent breathable diapers, frequent diaper changes, and gentle, mildly acidic wipes or water for cleansing. 25, 26, 27

This study provides important insights on DD prevalence and severity and the impact of caregiver behaviors on DD. The finding that infants with more pigmented skin were scored as having less severe rash is an interesting finding and requires further investigation. Techniques to reduce DD include the use of barrier creams to help protect skin from overhydration and contact with fecal irritants. The association of a lower frequency of DD with lower skin pH supports the use of mildly acidic cleaning products (eg, specially formulated baby wipes and soaps) to help maintain the skin's acid mantle and reduce the risk of skin damage by fecal enzymes which are more active at neutral or alkaline pH. The finding that DD is more frequently located in the perianal and intertriginous areas indicates caregivers should pay particular attention to these areas. There may be less airflow through these areas resulting in a moister environment, and it may be more difficult to clean these areas; these sites may benefit the most from prophylactic topical product use. Collectively, these results provide important insights into approaches to reduce DD severity and improve babies' health and well‐being.

5.1 Effects on Endocrine
System

Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

Because of the potential for systemic corticosteroid effects, patients may need to be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.

In a small trial, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (twice a day) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing. In addition, 2 separate trials in pediatric subjects demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.2 Diaper Dermatitis

The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended.

1 INTRODUCTION

Disposable diapers represent an essential consumer product in modern life. Diaper technology has advanced considerably and can contribute to improved quality of life by imparting dryness, hygiene, leakage control, and comfort. 1 Diapers are worn in close contact with the skin and, as such, can play a key role in managing skin health. Modern‐day disposable diapers are constructed with absorbency features that lock moisture away from the skin. 2

The absorption and sequestering of fecal matter away from the skin are essential to protecting infant skin health. When in contact with skin, bile salts, fecal enzymes, and other irritants found in stool can begin to break down the protective top layers of skin, which can induce diaper dermatitis. Prolonged stool contact with an infant's skin may also further exacerbate irritation, especially when the outer layers of skin are already compromised. 3

Managing this microenvironment within the diaper by preventing exposure to elements that cause skin breakdowns is essential to reducing the risk of rash and irritation. 4 One of the most important features of a diaper is the topsheet, the part of the diaper in immediate contact with an infant. The topsheet plays a key role in mitigating stool contact with the skin and can play a key role in skin‐related conditions, like diaper dermatitis. Previous research has demonstrated the role that diaper materials have in reducing the incidence of diaper dermatitis. 5 In a retrospective evaluation of clinical trials, the frequency of moderate to severe diaper dermatitis declined by 50% with the introduction of new absorbent materials. 6

Exclusively breastfed infants have stool that is well known to be difficult to contain. 7 Because of the heterogeneous consistency of breastfed infant stool, the stool is often not sufficiently absorbed into the core of the diaper and may be in contact with the skin. Because the stool is not adequately contained, it can leak out of the diaper, where it can increase the risk of skin irritation and dermatitis outside of the diapered region. Compounding this issue, exclusively breastfed infants have a higher median stool frequency per day than infants who are fed formula. 8

### Betamethasone cream to treat diapers rash causing Cushing syndrome [^113oDTZ1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Betamethasone causing iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome (CS) in infants are rarely reported.

Case Presentation

In this case report, there were severe signs of CS, such as considerable weight acceleration and concurrent height deceleration, hirsutism and ecchymosis of the face, and buffalo pad, which are often found in adults. Clobetasol propionate, diflucortolone valerate, and dexamethasone nasal sprays were used in the majority of previously reported cases of corticosteroid abuse, whereas this is the first case of CS in an infant as a result of the use of betamethasone cream, also known as betnesol, which is frequently used by mothers in developing countries as a treatment for rashes. In this instance, a severe medication interaction caused by systemic betamethasone cream buildup led to the creation of CS. For the professionals, these patients are a challenge because of drug use without prescription.

Conclusions

Topical corticosteroid usage puts infants at risk for CS. Because of excessive betamethasone treatment in this child with diaper dermatitis, he acquired CS. It is said to draw attention to the risks of self-medication in developing nations.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^111oE9xi]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

By study design, there were differences in age, weight, race, ethnicity, and Fitzpatrick skin type between countries, but babies were otherwise similar in regard to sex, birthweight, and gestational age at birth. DD scoring across all study participants revealed the perianal region had the highest DD frequency and severity, followed by the intertriginous, genital, and buttock regions.

Comparisons across geographies were also conducted on a subgroup of baby age 2‐8 months (Figure 2; Table 1) (China: n = 591; Germany: n = 316; USA: n = 276). Geographical differences in DD prevalence and severity observed in the overall population were mirrored in the 2‐8 months of subgroup. All subsequent comparisons were restricted to babies 2‐8 months to eliminate the confounding factor of age. In babies 2‐8 months of age, DD scored as moderate or greater severity (eg, a score of ≥ 2.0) was relatively infrequent, occurring in just 1.3% of babies in China, 8.7% in the USA, and 14.9% in Germany. One instance of Candida was noted in a baby from Germany in the setting of mild DD. All babies age 2‐8 months old in China were on an exclusive milk diet compared to 29.5% in the USA and 26.3% in Germany. The predominant source of milk was of human origin (China: 75.7%; USA: 50.6%; Germany: 65.1%). An analysis of diaper rash by race and Fitzpatrick skin type indicated higher levels of rash in lighter skin individuals or Caucasians compared to darker skin babies or Blacks. When considering only Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV, the geographical differences in DD prevalence and severity noted in the overall population remained (data not shown).

P6: "I applied salt to prevent the baby from developing a smell when they grow up, as advised by my mother-in-law. Personally, I doubt its effectiveness. Being bedridden after giving birth, I couldn't argue with them. It's hard to refute their beliefs, especially when they claim, "We did it this way, and everything turned out fine". I feel powerless to oppose it".

H13: "The baby is salted to prevent odor and sweating".

Diaper rash: Mothers reported using baby powder and diaper rash cream to treat their babies' rashes, while healthcare professionals mentioned that mothers also use sifted, untouched sand heated in a pan (known as 'höllük') for diaper rash treatment.

P27: "If there is a rash, I use powder or cream. I leave it clean the rash area".

H14: "They cook sifted, untouched sand in a pan for diaper rash. They think of it like powder. They apply this to the area where there is a rash".

Swaddling: 23 pregnant women stated that they tightly swaddled their babies, including their arms and legs. The primary reason cited by both pregnant women and healthcare professionals for swaddling was the desire for the baby to be strong and healthy. Moreover, both groups mentioned that the swaddle was sometimes secured with a rope, reflecting a customary approach believed to enhance the tightness and effectiveness of the wrapping.

P6: "I swaddled my baby and tied it with rope based on advice from people around me. They told me that swaddling strengthens the baby as they grow up".

### Characteristics of persistent diaper dermatitis in children with food allergy [^112QkcfZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Diaper dermatitis is often caused by irritant contact occurring beneath the diaper of an infant, and it is aggravated by factors such as dampness, friction, urea, and feces. Food-allergic patients are known to exhibit various skin lesions ranging from urticaria to eczema. This study aims to determine the relationship between persistent diaper dermatitis and food allergy.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of persistent diaper dermatitis between August 2015 and November 2017.

Results

The study included 157 patients diagnosed with persistent diaper dermatitis (67 male, 72 female; median age: 13 months). Diaper dermatitis was more common and included the whole perineum in children who had multiple food allergies (P = 0.001). In children with multiple food allergies, the course of diaper dermatitis was more severe, and the condition did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025). A longer elimination diet was required for patients with Type I reactions and persistent diaper dermatitis (P = 0.018). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more diffuse and covered the whole perineum (P = 0.025). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more severe and did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025).

Conclusions

Persistent diaper dermatitis lasting longer than a month may be associated with food allergy. The diaper rash may also be the only indicator of the food allergy. Elimination of the responsible food may allow these patients to recover from persistent diaper dermatitis.
