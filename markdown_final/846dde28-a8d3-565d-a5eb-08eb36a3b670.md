## Question

levaquin for copd exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using Levaquin (levofloxacin) for COPD exacerbation, including when it is indicated, how to dose it, how it compares with alternatives, and what the safety and stewardship considerations are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of the COPD exacerbation. Then, I should verify the indications and timing for antibiotics in COPD exacerbations. Next, I will review levofloxacin's regulatory status and dosing. After that, I should compare levofloxacin with other antibiotics and consider resistance patterns. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus risks, including adverse effects and stewardship, and synthesize a practical recommendation with duration and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framing, because antibiotic decisions hinge on severity and cardinal symptoms. Most COPD exacerbations are managed as outpatients, but severity ranges from mild to life-threatening, and the benefit of antibiotics is greatest in severe cases and in those with increased sputum purulence plus volume and/or dyspnea, whereas benefit is smaller and uncertain in mild outpatient exacerbations, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^1121mfMb] [^116VjHs8] [^112f7miJ].

> Wait, let me verify the indications for antibiotics in COPD exacerbations before jumping to levofloxacin. Guidelines recommend antibiotics when there is increased sputum purulence together with increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or when mechanical ventilation is required, and they advise choosing agents based on local resistance patterns. Typical first-line options include amoxicillin/clavulanate, macrolides, or tetracyclines, with fluoroquinolones reserved for selected patients, so levofloxacin is not first-line for most outpatients [^116VjHs8] [^115KNG56].

> I should confirm levofloxacin's regulatory status and labeled dosing. The FDA labeling includes levofloxacin for acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis/COPD, with a standard regimen of 500 mg once daily for 7 days by mouth or intravenously, which establishes both indication and a reference duration for treatment [^113yiv3r] [^113MLwrM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration. I initially thought 7 days was the only labeled course, but wait, I should double-check whether shorter fluoroquinolone courses are acceptable. Contemporary guidance supports 5 days for many COPD exacerbations when antibiotics are indicated, and a meta-analysis suggests short-course fluoroquinolones are noninferior to longer courses with fewer adverse effects, so a 5-day levofloxacin course can be reasonable in selected patients, though the FDA label still reflects 7 days and clinicians should align with local policy and patient factors [^115KNG56] [^115Qki4q] [^1159Zckd].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and where levofloxacin fits. Randomized data show levofloxacin achieves clinical success rates comparable to clarithromycin and that shorter-course fluoroquinolones like gemifloxacin or moxifloxacin can match or approximate levofloxacin's outcomes, while head-to-head data suggest moxifloxacin 5 days and levofloxacin 7 days have similar clinical and bacteriologic success in acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, reinforcing that duration can be shortened in some regimens without loss of efficacy [^1114PoD2] [^111ScLDM] [^111ncFRP].

> I need to ensure I account for resistance and stewardship. Fluoroquinolones should generally be reserved for patients with risk factors for resistant pathogens, severe disease, treatment failure, or recent antibiotic exposure, and local antibiograms should guide selection. Overuse accelerates resistance, and case reports document pneumococcal failures with levofloxacin, so I should avoid reflexive fluoroquinolone use in low-risk outpatients [^112d2K2o] [^114fCEFT] [^115Qdjjo].

> Let me consider safety and patient-specific risks. Levofloxacin carries risks of QT prolongation, dysglycemia, CNS effects, and tendon injury, with higher event rates in older adults or those with renal impairment, so I should screen for interacting drugs, baseline QT risk, and renal function before prescribing, and I should counsel patients to stop therapy if they develop tendon pain or neuropsychiatric symptoms [^notfound] [^115DLQKj].

> But wait, what if the exacerbation is mild and nonpurulent. I should confirm that antibiotics may not help in that scenario. For mild to moderate outpatient exacerbations without the cardinal bacterial features, evidence for routine antibiotics is mixed and often small, and some guidelines conclude evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against antibiotics in this group, so I should individualize and consider withholding antibiotics when viral etiology is likely or symptoms are mild [^114qww8X] [^115c76RV] [^112f7miJ].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In severe exacerbations requiring ICU care or mechanical ventilation, antibiotics confer substantial benefit on treatment failure and mortality, and in such cases a respiratory fluoroquinolone like levofloxacin is a reasonable empiric option when local resistance patterns support it, ideally alongside sputum cultures to target therapy. In elderly patients with frequent exacerbations or bronchiectasis, risk for resistant organisms is higher, so broader coverage may be justified, but again, this must be balanced against resistance and toxicity risks [^115JxXYo] [^114fCEFT] [^112Bv8zM].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a patient with a COPD exacerbation and increased sputum purulence plus increased volume and/or dyspnea, antibiotics are indicated. If there are no risk factors for Pseudomonas or recent fluoroquinolone exposure, I would preferentially choose amoxicillin/clavulanate, a macrolide, or doxycycline based on local resistance data. If there are risk factors, treatment failure, or intolerance to first-line agents, levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 5 to 7 days is reasonable, with 5 days supported by contemporary guidance and 7 days by FDA labeling, and I should reassess at 48 to 72 hours for clinical response and adjust if there is no improvement [^116VjHs8] [^115KNG56] [^113yiv3r].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and prevention steps. After acute treatment, optimize inhaled bronchodilators, consider systemic corticosteroids for severe exacerbations, and evaluate for long-term prevention strategies in frequent exacerbators, recognizing that macrolide prophylaxis has the most consistent evidence while fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not recommended due to lack of benefit and higher harms, and I should document the rationale if I deviate from first-line antibiotic choices for stewardship audits [^116SWGkW] [^114C293u] [^116svfeL].

Levaquin (levofloxacin) is **indicated for acute bacterial exacerbations of COPD** [^115DLQKj] when patients have increased sputum purulence with increased volume and/or dyspnea, or when mechanical ventilation is required [^116VjHs8]. It is **not first-line** due to resistance risk and adverse effects; reserve it for patients with severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or beta-lactam allergy [^112d2K2o]. The standard dose is 500 mg orally or IV once daily for 7 days [^113yiv3r] [^113MLwrM]; shorter 5-day courses are supported by some guidelines and meta-analyses but are not FDA-labeled [^115KNG56] [^115Qki4q]. Monitor for QT prolongation, CNS effects, and C. difficile infection, and use local resistance data to guide therapy [^114fCEFT].

## Indications for levaquin in COPD exacerbation

Levaquin is indicated for **acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis/COPD** [^115DLQKj] in adults when the following clinical features are present:

- **Increased sputum purulence**: Change in sputum color suggesting bacterial infection [^116VjHs8].

- **Increased sputum volume**: Greater than usual sputum production [^115KNG56].

- **Increased dyspnea**: Worsening shortness of breath beyond baseline [^115yYBmE].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Invasive or noninvasive ventilation support [^115KNG56].

These criteria align with **GOLD 2025 guidelines** [^116VjHs8], which recommend antibiotics for exacerbations with increased sputum purulence plus increased volume and/or dyspnea, or for patients requiring mechanical ventilation [^115KNG56].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting levaquin use

Several studies and meta-analyses support the **effectiveness of levofloxacin** in treating COPD exacerbations:

- **Clinical success**: Levofloxacin achieves clinical success rates comparable to other antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate [^1114PoD2].

- **Short-course therapy**: Meta-analyses show that short-course fluoroquinolone therapy (≤ 5 days) is as effective as longer courses (7 days) and may reduce adverse effects [^115Qki4q].

- **Bacteriological eradication**: Levofloxacin demonstrates high bacteriological eradication rates against common COPD pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae [^1114PoD2].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

The **standard regimen** for levofloxacin in COPD exacerbation is:

| **Formulation** | **Dosage** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral tablets | 500 mg | Once daily | 7 days [^113yiv3r] |
| Intravenous (IV) | 500 mg | Once daily | 7 days [^113MLwrM] |

---

Some guidelines suggest that **shorter courses (≤ 5 days)** may be effective in selected patients [^115KNG56], but this is not currently reflected in the FDA labeling [^113yiv3r].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Levaquin is **generally reserved** for specific scenarios due to its broad spectrum and potential adverse effects. Compared with other antibiotics commonly used for COPD exacerbations:

- **Amoxicillin/clavulanate**: Preferred first-line agent for many patients due to efficacy and safety [^notfound].

- **Macrolides (azithromycin)**: Effective alternative, particularly in patients with frequent exacerbations or specific risk factors [^notfound].

- **Doxycycline**: Considered in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations or penicillin allergy [^notfound].

Levaquin is **particularly useful** in patients with severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or beta-lactam allergy, but its use should be balanced against the risk of adverse effects and resistance development [^112d2K2o].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Levaquin has a **well-characterized safety profile**, with potential adverse effects including:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia are common [^notfound].

- **Central nervous system**: Headache, insomnia, dizziness, and rarely seizures [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular**: QT prolongation, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^notfound].

- **Musculoskeletal**: Tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in elderly patients or those on corticosteroids [^notfound].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Risk of severe diarrhea and colitis [^notfound].

Patients should be monitored for these adverse effects, and therapy should be discontinued if significant adverse reactions occur [^notfound].

---

## Resistance considerations

Fluoroquinolone resistance among respiratory pathogens is a growing concern. Appropriate use of levaquin, guided by **local resistance patterns** and patient-specific factors, is essential to minimize resistance development [^114fCEFT]. Routine use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy is discouraged unless specific indications are present [^112d2K2o].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **stratified approach** to antibiotic selection in COPD exacerbations:

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin/clavulanate, macrolides, or tetracyclines are preferred for most patients [^114fCEFT].

- **Reserve levaquin**: For patients with severe disease, frequent exacerbations, beta-lactam allergy, or specific risk factors for resistant pathogens [^112d2K2o].

- **Duration**: Typically 5–7 days, with shorter courses considered in selected patients [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd].

---

Levaquin (levofloxacin) is effective for **acute bacterial exacerbations of COPD**, particularly in patients with severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or beta-lactam allergy. It is not first-line due to resistance risk and adverse effects; use should be guided by clinical features, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors. The standard dose is 500 mg once daily for 7 days, with shorter courses considered in selected patients.

### Moxifloxacin for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113yTf57]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

The significant impact of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is now recognized. This recognition has led to increased efforts to provide evidence-based, appropriate treatment of AECOPD, to minimize its negative impact. This article reviews the bacterial etiology of AECOPD and clinical trials (both placebo-controlled and antibiotic comparison trials) that support the use of antibiotics for AECOPD, with an emphasis on the role of newer fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with this condition. A discussion of patient stratification that permits identification of those who require initial aggressive antibiotic therapy is presented.

Main Findings

Among the treatment modalities for exacerbations, the role and choice of antibiotics is hotly debated. Current evidence supports the use of antibiotics in the treatment of AECOPD, because bacterial pathogens cause approximately half the exacerbations, and because empirical antibiotics have a significant benefit in most exacerbations. Several recent investigations have aided in the development of a rational antibiotic strategy for AECOPD. These include outcome studies that have identified patients who are likely to have a poor outcome of their exacerbation and, therefore, are candidates for aggressive initial antibiotic therapy. Studies of the new fluoroquinolone agents have shown superior short- and long-term clinical results among patients with AECOPD who are at risk of a poor outcome.

Conclusions

Theoretical concerns about the emergence of resistance to the fluoroquinolones dictate not only the appropriate use of these drugs but, also, the use of the most-potent agents available in this class, to sustain their usefulness over time. Such selected use of the new fluoroquinolones balances individual benefit with societal concerns regarding the use of these agents for the treatment of AECOPD.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, antibiotics, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotics for acute exacerbation of COPD in patients with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Choose antibiotics based on local resistance patterns, with empiric options including amoxicillin/clavulanate, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected cases, quinolone.

### Levofloxacin versus clarithromycin in COPD exacerbation: focus on exacerbation-free interval [^1114PoD2]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment of bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shows some immediate clinical benefits and may also minimise the frequency of further recurrences. Patients (n = 511) were enrolled into a randomised double-blind multicentric study comparing the exacerbation-free interval (EFI), efficacy and safety of 7-day levofloxacin versus 10-day clarithromycin in patients with COPD exacerbation. Patients were monitored over a 1-yr period. A total of 434 patients (per protocol population) received the medication for ≥ 5 days. The median EFI in the per protocol population was 300 days for levofloxacin and 350 days for clarithromycin. For patients with a new documented exacerbation during follow-up (n = 223), the median EFI was 100.5 days in the levofloxacin group and 95 days for clarithromycin. No significant differences in EFI between groups could be observed when stratifying the study population according to microbial aetiology and severity of bronchial obstruction. Levofloxacin and clarithromycin showed similar clinical success rates. The bacteriological success rate was significantly higher in the levofloxacin group. Both antibiotics were well tolerated. In summary, levofloxacin was associated with a significantly higher bacteriological eradication rate but similar exacerbation-free interval in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation compared to clarithromycin.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^112ajs61]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116e1ywh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fluoroquinolone prophylaxis with moxifloxacin has been evaluated using pulsed dosing with measurable effects on exacerbations. The fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has been used as a 5-day pulse every 8 weeks to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe COPD, and in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial it reduced exacerbations by 25% overall and by up to 45% in the subgroup of patients with purulent or mucopurulent sputum at baseline; results suggest particular effectiveness in patients likely colonized by bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while key determinants such as which patients benefit most, optimal dosage and duration, mode of action, other patient-centered outcomes, and between-fluoroquinolone differences remain unknown.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of short-versus standard-course fluoroquinolone treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of double-blind studies [^115Qki4q]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this meta-analysis is to determine whether a short course (≤ 5 days) of fluoroquinolone treatment is as effective as a long course (7 days) in the treatment of patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched to 2021. Studies considered eligible for inclusion were randomized trials of antibiotic intervention involving adult patients > 18 years of age with a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD, no antimicrobial at the time of the diagnosis and who received treatment with fluoroquinolones in 2 different course duration. The primary outcome analyzed was the clinical cure rate at early follow-up in an intention-to-treat.

Findings

Nine studies with a total of 3951 patients met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the study was high or very high with > 77% of the studies having a Jadad score of at least 4. At early (< 21 days) and late follow-up, there was no significant difference in clinical cure between the short course of fluoroquinolones therapy and the conventional course (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.04; P = 0.82). Similar results were found for both antibiotic regimens regarding bacteriologic clearance (OR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75–1.22; P = 0.73). Short course was not inferior to the long course when using the same quinolone (OR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95–1.04; P = 0.73) and it had significantly reduced adverse effects (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–0.89; P < 0.05).

Implications

A short course of fluoroquinolones proved to be as effective as and safer than conventional course in the treatment of patients diagnosed with acute exacerbation of COPD. Further research is encouraged to clarify the long-term outcomes in patients receiving short course of quinolones compared with the conventional course (NCT05380375).

### Antimicrobial therapies for prevention of recurrent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): beyond the guidelines [^111ELuxd]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Inhaled antibiotics (Table 2)

Table 2
Summary of inhaled antibiotic regimes in COPD

Studies on nebulised antibiotics have reported some controversial results and inconclusive data on their efficacy in other obstructive, suppurative lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Inhaled delivery of pharmacological therapy allows targeted drug delivery to the respiratory tract, thus reducing the systemic side effects of antimicrobial therapy and is potentially more suitable for prophylaxis. The most common side-effects are wheezing and local irritation, which can often be ameliorated with bronchodilator therapy prior to their use.

Despite these potential benefits, there are limited studies suggesting a benefit of inhaled antibiotics in the COPD population to date, which is summarised in Table 2. Most of these trials are small, single centre, uncontrolled studies and target those with Pa colonisation. Pa colonisation is an important prognostic factor in patients with COPD, as exacerbations in this setting are commonly challenging to treat, often requiring in-hospital management. Pa is notoriously difficult to eradicate and its presence can herald faster disease progression and higher mortality. Interestingly, there is huge variability in reported prevalence of Pa colonization rates in the above mentioned studies, 4.2% of over 22,000 outpatients and 40% of a much smaller cohort study of 18a outpatients, suggesting high variability within COPD populations. More severe exacerbator subgroups of patients will be associated with higher rates of Pa and other gram-negative organisms.

A randomised placebo controlled RCT by Sethi et al. evaluated the role of inhaled levofloxacin in COPD patients, irrespective of sputum pathogens. Levofloxacin has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and atypical bacteria, but limited activity against most anaerobic bacteria. This theoretically would be a reasonable choice for inhaled prophylaxis as the majority of pathogenic organisms in COPD would be covered. Compared with inhaled eradication strategies for resistant organism such as Pa that rotate four weeks of antibiotics, the authors feel that the 5 day regime each month, adopted in this study may have been inadequate to show a definitive benefit and trials of longer duration of therapy would be welcomed to clarify this limitation.

### Patient stratification in the management of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: the role of levofloxacin 750 mg [^112FQDdA]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective clinical trial in which patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis have been stratified by degree of underlying illness. Uncomplicated patients were randomised to levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days or azithromycin q.d. for 5 days. Complicated patients were randomised to levofloxacin 750 mg q.d. for 5 days or amoxicillin 875 mg/clavulanate 125 mg twice daily for 10 days. Regardless of therapy, complicated patients demonstrated lower clinical and microbiological success than uncomplicated patients. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was similar for levofloxacin and azithromycin (93.0 versus 90.1%, respectively), and levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate (79.2 versus 81.7%, respectively). For microbiologically evaluable patients, clinical response to levofloxacin for 3 days was superior to azithromycin for 5 days (96.3 versus 87.4%, respectively), and levofloxacin for 5 days was similar to amoxicillin/clavulanate for 10 days (81.4 versus 80.9%, respectively). Microbiological eradication was superior for levofloxacin for 3 days compared with azithromycin for 5 days (93.8 versus 82.8%, respectively), and similar for levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate for 10 days (81.4 versus 79.8%, respectively). In conclusion, levofloxacin 750 mg for 3 days was comparable to azithromycin for 5 days for uncomplicated patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, while 5 days of 750 mg levofloxacin was comparable to 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate for complicated acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.

Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.

3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. 3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed.

27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms. 27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies.

### Antibiotics for treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^115r2MZM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study indicated that dirithromycin has a high clinical cure rate with a low rate of adverse effects. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also have high clinical cure rates with median rates of adverse effects. However, caution should still be exercised when using antibiotics to treat acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Once daily oral ofloxacin in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115JxXYo]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

The role of antibiotics in treatment of patients with moderate exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is uncertain, but such treatment might be useful in very severe episodes. Our objective was to assess the effects of ofloxacin in patients with exacerbations of COPD who required mechanical ventilation.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 93 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD who required mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral ofloxacin 400 mg once daily (n = 47) or placebo (46) for 10 days. Primary endpoints were death in hospital and need for an additional course of antibiotics, both separately and in combination. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Three patients dropped out of the study. Two (4%) patients receiving ofloxacin died in hospital and ten (22%) did so in the placebo group (absolute risk reduction 17.5%, 95% CI 4.3–30.7, p = 0.01). Treatment with ofloxacin significantly reduced the need for additional courses of antibiotics (28.4%, 12.9–43.9, p = 0.0006). The combined frequency of death in hospital and need for additional antibiotics was significantly lower in patients assigned to ofloxacin than in those receiving placebo (45.9%, 29.1–62.7, p < 0.0001). The duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ofloxacin group than in the placebo group (absolute difference 4.2 days, 95% CI 2.5–5.9; and 9.6 days, 3.4–12.8, respectively).

Interpretation

New fluoroquinolones, such as ofloxacin, are beneficial in the treatment of COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114fCEFT]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic selection for COPD exacerbations — empiric choices, cultures, and route: The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern, and initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline or, in selected patients, quinolone. For patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction, and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other lung materials should be performed because gram-negative bacteria or resistant pathogens may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to eat and antibiotic pharmacokinetics, although it is preferable that antibiotics be given orally, and improvements in dyspnea and sputum purulence suggest clinical success.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^115JN8fZ]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our historical analysis showed that the evaluation of antibiotics for mild to moderate COPD exacerbations has been far from optimal. Head-to-head trials have been conducted without any supporting evidence from placebo-controlled trials. This phenomenon raises important scientific and ethical concerns and more studies are warranted to find out its prevalence, mechanisms and consequences in medicine. In the meantime, public funding bodies and ethical committees in particular should encourage the careful conduct or study of pertinent systematic reviews before supporting the conduct of new trials.

### Appropriate outpatient treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [^113cw2Qg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), which are characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), contribute to morbidity and decreased quality of life for patients with COPD. A significant proportion of these exacerbations are due to bacterial infections. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria provide guidance for choosing the optimal drug at its optimal dose and duration for antimicrobial treatment of AECB due to bacterial infection. Evidence-based guidelines recommend stratifying patients according to risk factors to improve selection of targeted antimicrobial therapy. With increasing rates of resistance to some antimicrobials, resistance is also an important consideration for reducing treatment failures and decreasing the need for further pharmacologic treatment. Fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with chronic bronchitis who have risk factors; gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and levofloxacin are highly active against commonly encountered pathogens. Safety profiles are an important consideration because adverse events and poor tolerability can reduce patient adherence rates, which in turn can lead to poorer outcomes. Safety profiles also become an important consideration as shorter-course, higher-dose therapies become more prevalent. First-line therapy with a well-tolerated antibiotic that is active against the predominant pathogens, combined with low resistance rates and a convenient once-a-day dosing regimen, may reduce overall costs. Fluoroquinolones exhibit low resistance, good activity levels, and high respiratory penetration, and they are particularly well suited for shorter-course, higher-dose regimens in selected patients. Shorter-course, higher dose regimens, in turn, may be more effective, cost-efficient, and appropriate for controlling the rise of resistance than standard regimens.

Results

Literature search

In our study, 478 articles were identified after duplications were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 421 of these articles were excluded. The full-text of the remaining 57 articles were assessed and the following articles were excluded: secondary research studies (9), studies of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (6), studies with no desired outcome (6), studies that included other types of patients (5), studies where the type of antibiotic is unclear (4), studies that included comparison of medication strategies (3), studies without an RCT design (2), conference abstracts (2), and protocols (1). Ultimately, 19 articles, published between 1996 and 2016, that assessed 5906 patients were collected for our systematic review (Fig. 1, Table 1). One of the included trials contained four intervention arms.

Study characteristics

In the included studies, the most common research region was Europe. Studies were also conducted in Asia, North America, and Africa. There were more men than women in the study population, although one study did not mention the ratio of men to women. The following 17 antibiotics were included in our analysis: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, prulifloxacin, sparfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and zabofloxacin. The shortest follow-up time was 10 days and the longest was 1 year 3 months. All the included studies were RCTs and 4 studies were open-label. Overall, the quality of the studies was ideal (Fig. 2).

### Pulsed moxifloxacin for the prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114toP6w]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This proof-of-concept study evaluates whether intermittent pulsed moxifloxacin treatment could reduce the frequency of these exacerbations.

Methods

Stable patients with COPD were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to receive moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (N = 573) or placebo (N = 584) once a day for 5 days. Treatment was repeated every 8 weeks for a total of six courses. Patients were repeatedly assessed clinically and microbiologically during the 48-week treatment period, and for a further 24 weeks' follow-up.

Results

At 48 weeks the odds ratio (OR) for suffering an exacerbation favoured moxifloxacin: per-protocol (PP) population (N = 738, OR 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.565–0.994, p = 0.046), intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N = 1149, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.645–1.008, p = 0.059), and a post-hoc analysis of per-protocol (PP) patients with purulent/mucopurulent sputum production at baseline (N = 323, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.84, p = 0.006). There were no significant differences between moxifloxacin and placebo in any pre-specified efficacy subgroup analyses or in hospitalization rates, mortality rates, lung function or changes in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total scores. There was, however, a significant difference in favour of moxifloxacin in the SGRQ symptom domain (ITT: -8.2 vs -3.8, p = 0.009; PP: -8.8 vs -4.4, p = 0.006). Moxifloxacin treatment was not associated with consistent changes in moxifloxacin susceptibility. There were more treatment-emergent, drug related adverse events with moxifloxacin vs placebo (p < 0.001) largely due to gastrointestinal events (4.7% vs 0.7%).

Conclusions

Intermittent pulsed therapy with moxifloxacin reduced the odds of exacerbation by 20% in the ITT population, by 25% among the PP population and by 45% in PP patients with purulent/mucopurulent sputum at baseline. There were no unexpected adverse events and there was no evidence of resistance development.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112f7miJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain, as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess effects of antibiotics on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) for management of acute COPD exacerbations, as well as their effects on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other electronically available databases up to 26 September 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo and providing follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients, and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised as a single group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation, and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. When authors of primary studies did not report outcomes or study details, we contacted them to request missing data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (ORs) for rare events (mortality and adverse events), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes using random-effects models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation.

Main Results

We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients). For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain. In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate-quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 565 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254). Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate-quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD -9.60 days, 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36; low-quality evidence). Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate-quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay). Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients. Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health-related quality of life or on other patient-reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) should be avoided.

### Short-course fluoroquinolone therapy in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD [^113cgW3y]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant healthcare costs and contribute to the progress of the disease. Although a number of factors may trigger these episodes, between 40% and 60% are bacterial in nature. Antimicrobial therapy can be effective in treating exacerbations, leading to improved peak expiratory flow rates, fewer hospitalizations, lower relapse rates, and greater clinical success. Evidence suggests that short-course antimicrobial therapy can be as effective as standard duration therapy (> 7 days) in treating exacerbations. Randomized trials have shown that clinical and bacteriological success rates are comparable with both 5-day and standard antibiotic courses. Furthermore, 5-day fluoroquinolone therapy is associated with faster recovery, fewer relapses, prolonged duration between episodes, and less hospitalization when compared with standard therapy. Both moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin have received FDA-approval for 5-day therapy in AECB.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111ECBZt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) and on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other electronically available databases up to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo with a follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised in one group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. Where outcomes or study details were not reported we requested missing data from the authors of the primary studies. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (OR) for rare events (mortality and adverse events) and weighted mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes using fixed-effect models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Sixteen trials with 2068 participants were included. In outpatients (mild to moderate exacerbations), there was evidence of low quality that antibiotics did statistically significantly reduce the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94; I(2) = 35%) but they did not significantly reduce the risk when the meta-analysis was restricted to currently available drugs (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I(2) = 33%). Evidence of high quality showed that antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure in inpatients with severe exacerbations (ICU not included) (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; I(2) = 47%) regardless of whether restricted to current drugs. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; high-quality evidence). Evidence of low-quality from four trials in inpatients showed no effect of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.79). High-quality evidence from one trial showed a statistically significant effect on mortality in ICU patients (Peto OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in the antibiotics and placebo groups except for the ICU study where antibiotics statistically significantly reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference -9.60 days; 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36 days). One trial showed no effect of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group. Evidence of moderate quality showed that the overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the antibiotics groups (Peto OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27). Patients treated with antibiotics experienced statistically significantly more diarrhoea based on three trials (Peto OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.11 to 6.17; high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU. However, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111Koq5T]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review informs the debate about appropriate prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. As long as exacerbations remain an ill-defined event, the distinction between in- and outpatient treatment may serve as simple guidance to decide for or against antibiotics. Patients with severe exacerbations requiring hospital admission benefit substantially from antibiotics. In outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics appear to offer no benefits in general. Further research will show how the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, who might benefit from antibiotics, can be identified.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: what studies are still needed? [^114k3YFH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains the subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. First, the contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. In addition, several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. Secondly, it is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs. In particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations in AECBs to be drawn up. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as the community, and the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### COPD: management of acute exacerbations and chronic stable… [^1144nr3F]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of COPD can be caused by many factors, including environmental irritants, heart failure or noncompliance with medication use. Pharmacologic Management of Exacerbations Because no curative therapy is available, management of severe exacerbations of COPD should be directed at relieving symptoms and restoring functional capacity. 5 Patients with COPD often have poor baseline functional status with few respiratory reserves. Infections can worsen their condition and lead to a quick decline in pulmonary function. The ATS has recommended strategies for managing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. 5 These strategies include beta 2 agonists, the addition of anticholinergics, the intravenous administration of corticosteroids, antibiotic therapy when indicated, and the intravenous administration of methylxanthines such as aminophylline.

11 Hospitalization of patients with COPD may be necessary to provide antibiotic therapy, appropriate supportive care and monitoring of oxygen status. Oxygen supplementation via external devices or mechanical ventilation may be indicated to maintain oxygen delivery to vital tissues. CORTICOSTEROIDS Short courses of systemic corticosteroids may provide important benefits in patients with exacerbations of COPD. A recent clinical trial 32 involving 271 patients in Veterans Affairs hospitals showed that steroid therapy resulted in moderate improvement of clinical outcomes, with shorter hospital stays and increases in FEV 1. The fact that there were no significant differences between patients treated for two weeks and those treated for eight weeks justifies the use of a shorter course of corticosteroids to reduce the occurrence of adverse effects. Adverse effects can include hyperglycemia, secondary infection and behavioral changes.
33.

For severe exacerbations of COPD requiring inpatient therapy, methylprednisolone sodium succinate is commonly used initially. The steroid is administered intravenously in a dosage of 1 to 2 mg per kg every six to 12 hours. After two to three days of intravenous therapy, the patient can be switched to orally administered prednisone in a starting dosage of 60 mg daily for a total of two weeks of therapy. Tapering doses of prednisone should then be given over a two-week period to avoid adverse effects from sudden withdrawal. One set of investigators 43 found significant decreases in hospital admissions and length of hospital stays for acute exacerbations of COPD in patients treated with CPAP and LTOT. Home health care services and nursing care are essential to assist patients in the proper use of these measures.

Identification of studies

Figure 1 summarises the process of identifying eligible clinical trials. We identified 765 citations from electronic databases and selected 35 of them for full text assessment. Together with 30 additional citations from hand-searching we studied 65 publications in detail. We included 13 trials with 1557 COPD patients in the analyses. We excluded most trials because they compared different antibiotics without having a placebo control group. From trial registers, we identified four randomised trials that are still ongoing. The pharmaceutical industry did not provide any unpublished data.

### Revisiting the use of antibiotics to prevent COPD exacerbation: is doxycycline the answer? [^116vBePB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease and a leading contributor to global disease burden as one of the top three causes of death worldwide. In 2019, COPD led to 3.28 million deaths and 74.43 million disability-adjusted life-years. Exacerbations complicate the clinical course of COPD and have been related to poor quality of life, decline in lung function, and increased mortality. It is estimated that 30–50% patients with COPD experience at least one exacerbation every year. Prevention of COPD exacerbation is a major goal of COPD management, with multiple modalities of interventions available. The prophylactic use of antibiotics in select patients with COPD has been suggested as one strategy to prevent COPD exacerbation. In a recent Cochrane review, prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with stable COPD decreased the odds of exacerbation by 43% (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.78), with the number needed to treat to prevent one person with exacerbation being eight. This benefit was demonstrated across studies examining continuous or intermittent antibiotic regimens. A subsequent Cochrane review compared the use of different classes of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with COPD and found that macrolides were the only class of drugs whose use increased the time to a subsequent exacerbation and was associated with improved quality of life. Use of quinolones and tetracyclines was not associated with any clear benefit. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy recommends considering the addition of macrolides, specifically azithromycin, in non–current smokers with COPD who continue to experience exacerbations despite treatment with a combination therapy of a long-acting β-agonist, a long-acting muscarinic agent, and an inhaled corticosteroid or in those with a baseline blood eosinophil count < 100 cells/μl. It is noteworthy that data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of azithromycin use to prevent COPD exacerbations beyond 1 year are lacking.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^116Dxw2f]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis [^112Bv8zM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components — emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111gEY5L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

The studies available to date used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations, such as those involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, current smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

Question 3: In Patients with COPD Who Are Receiving Triple Therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), Should the ICS Be Withdrawn?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA, we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done for the exacerbation outcome based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with no exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, all-cause death, ICU admissions, dyspnea, health-related QOL, and physical activity as critical outcomes.

### Antibiotics for acute and chronic respiratory infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113MuBN6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prevention and effective treatment of exacerbations are major objectives in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics are mainstay treatment for patients with severe COPD with an acute exacerbation that includes increased sputum purulence and worsening shortness of breath. Although such treatment is associated with clinical benefit, treatment failure and relapse rates may be high, particularly in cases of inadequate antibiotic therapy through incomplete resolution of the initial exacerbation and persistent bacterial infection. These aspects have led to recommendations for a stratified approach to antibiotic therapy based on patient characteristics associated with increased risk factors for failure. Patients at greatest risk for poor outcome (i.e., those with severe COPD) are likely to derive greatest benefit from early treatment with antibiotics. Long-term or intermittent antibiotic treatment has been shown to prevent COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations. These effects may be achieved by reducing bacterial load in the airways in stable state and/or bronchial inflammation. Although systemic antibiotics are likely to remain the core treatment for patients with moderate to severe exacerbated COPD, inhaled antibiotics may represent a more optimal approach for the treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations in the future. Regardless of the route of administration, further studies are required to evaluate the potential long-term adverse events of antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^113DWkzL]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of antibiotics in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. It is unclear which patients should receive antibiotics. The uncertainty arises from a complex clinical situation where the cause of the exacerbation is often unidentifiable. Around 40–50% of exacerbations may be attributed to bacteria while other causes include viral infections or environmental irritants. Even if bacteria are identified, it is uncertain whether they actually caused the exacerbation or whether they were present as part of the flora before the exacerbation.

Diagnostic tests cannot reliably distinguish between bacterial, viral or other origins of exacerbations. As a consequence, many physicians decide to be on the "safe" side and prescribe antibiotics. The uncertain role of antibiotics is reflected by current guidelines that insufficiently inform physicians about adequate prescription of antibiotics. Guidelines suggest adding an antibiotic if sputum is purulent, if sputum volume is increased and/or if fever is present. However, evidence supporting this suggestion is not based on randomised trials. There are no randomised trials where prescription of antibiotics was guided by purulence of sputum or other criteria. In addition, the extent of symptom worsening is difficult to standardise and utility of sputum assessment is controversial.

A systematic review of randomised, placebo-controlled trials could inform the debate about the role of antibiotics substantially. Eleven years ago, a meta-analysis suggested a small improvement of lung function by antibiotics in COPD patients with an exacerbation, but the review was limited by the restriction to articles in English and its focus on lung function. A recent systematic review considered patient-important outcomes but missed some studies and included a non-randomised trial. Inclusion of all available trials is, however, crucial to avoid selection bias and to study factors modifying the effects of antibiotics such as severity of exacerbation. Therefore, our aim was to review all randomised placebo-controlled trials that assessed the effects of antibiotics on patient-important outcomes in COPD patients suffering from exacerbations.

### Targeted retreatment of incompletely recovered chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with ciprofloxacin. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III clinical trial [^1148P3fH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are prone to nonrecovery, but there are no data about the effectiveness of retreatment for these prolonged events. We examined whether further therapy with ciprofloxacin for incompletely resolved COPD exacerbations prolonged the time until the next event. Objectives: To assess whether incompletely recovered COPD exacerbations benefit from additional treatment with ciprofloxacin, at Day 14. Methods: In a multicenter, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we studied retreatment with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg or matched placebo twice daily for 7 days in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage II-IV COPD and persistent symptoms and/or serum C-reactive protein ≥ 8 mg/L initiated 14 (± 3) days after an index COPD exacerbation. The primary outcome was the time to the next exacerbation within a 90-day period. Measurements and Main Results: Among 826 patients screened at four centers, 144 eligible participants with incomplete recovery were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (n = 72) or placebo (n = 72). Within 90 days of randomization, 57% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 53% in the placebo group experienced one or more exacerbations. The median time to the next exacerbation was 32.5 days (interquartile range 13–50) in the placebo arm and 34 days (interquartile range 17–62) in the ciprofloxacin arm, which was not significantly different (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.68; P = 0.76). No significant differences were seen in quality-of-life scores or lung function between the treatment groups. Conclusions: In patients with persistent symptoms and/or raised C-reactive protein 14 days after a COPD exacerbation, an additional course of ciprofloxacin resulted in no additional benefit compared with placebo. This suggests that nonrecovered exacerbations are not driven by ongoing bacterial infection and may potentially be targeted with antiinflammatory therapy.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Antibiotics for treatment and prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VuTEe]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations (AE) can be recurrent problems for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that ≥ 50% of acute exacerbations involve bacteria requiring treatment with an antibiotic which should have high activity against the causative pathogens. However, sputum analysis is not a pre-requisite for antibiotic prescription in outpatients as results are delayed and patients are likely to be colonised with bacteria in the stable state. Clinicians rely on the clinical symptoms, sputum appearance and the patient's medical history to decide if an AE-COPD should be treated with antibiotics. This article reviews the available data of antibiotic trials in AE-COPD. Management of frequent exacerbators is particularly challenging for physicians. This may include antibiotic prophylaxis, especially macrolides because of anti-inflammatory properties; though successful in reducing exacerbations, concerns about resistance development remain. Inhalation of antibiotics achieves high local concentrations and minimal systemic exposure; therefore, it may represent an attractive alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in certain COPD patients. Inhaled antibiotic prophylaxis has been successfully used in other respiratory conditions such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis which itself might be present in COPD patients who have chronic bacterial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^116svfeL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There has been renewal of interest in the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objectives

To determine whether or not regular treatment of COPD patients with prophylactic antibiotics reduces exacerbations or affects quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was August 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration. Data were extracted and analysed by two independent review authors.

Main Results

Seven RCTs involving 3170 patients were included in this systematic review. All studies were published between 2001 and 2011. Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis (termed 'pulsed' for this review). The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin. Azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin are macrolides while moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. The study duration varied from three months to 36 months and all used intention-to-treat analysis. Most of the results were of moderate quality. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low, and we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of bias. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 66 years and with at least a moderate severity of COPD. Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen. The primary outcomes for this review were the number of exacerbations and quality of life. With use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics the number of patients experiencing an exacerbation was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77, 3 studies, 1262 participants, high quality). This represented a reduction from 69% of participants in the control group compared to 54% in the treatment group (95% CI 46% to 63%) and the number needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation (NNTb) was therefore 8 (95% CI 5 to 18). The frequency of exacerbations was also reduced with continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment (rate ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91). Use of pulsed antibiotic treatment showed a non-significant reduction in the number of people with exacerbations (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.09, 1 study, 1149 participants, moderate quality) and the test for interaction showed that this result was significantly different from the effect on exacerbations with continuous antibiotics. There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life with both continuous and pulsed antibiotic treatment but this was smaller than the four unit improvement that is regarded as being clinically significant (MD -1.78; 95% CI -2.95 to -0.61, 2 studies, 1962 participants, moderate quality). Neither pulsed nor continuous antibiotics showed a significant effect on the secondary outcomes of frequency of hospital admissions, change in lung function, serious adverse events or all-cause mortality (moderate quality evidence). The adverse events that were recorded varied among the trials depending on the different antibiotics used. Azithromycin was associated with a significant hearing loss in the treatment group. The moxifloxacin pulsed study reported a significantly higher number of adverse events in the treatment arm due to the marked increase in gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.001). Some adverse events that led to drug discontinuation, such as development of long QTc or tinnitus, were not significantly more frequent in the treatment group than the placebo group but pose important considerations in clinical practice. The development of antibiotic resistance in the community is of major concern. One study found newly colonised patients to have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. Patients colonised with moxifloxacin-sensitive pseudomonas at initiation of therapy rapidly became resistant with the quinolone treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics results in a clinically significant benefit in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients. All trials of continuous antibiotics used macrolides hence the noted benefit applies only to the use of continuous macrolide antibiotics. The impact of pulsed antibiotics remains uncertain and requires further research. The trials in this review included patients who were frequent exacerbators and needed treatment with antibiotics or systemic steroids, or who were on supplemental oxygen. There were also older individuals with a mean age of 66 years. The results of these trials apply only to the group of patients who were studied in these trials and may not be generalisable to other groups. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^113fABeG]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

All antibiotics are not the same

An additional consideration is the spectrum of the different antibiotics used to treat COPD. In this study, the authors tended to treat all antibiotics as equivalent when used to treat exacerbations of COPD. Antibiotics do differ in their antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and ability to penetrate respiratory tissues. Recent studies indeed show differences in clinical outcomes among antibiotics used in exacerbations. A recent meta-analysis of antibiotic comparison trials, which were quite homogenous, demonstrated that amoxicillin results in suboptimal outcomes with increased risk of clinical failures in COPD. This has been seen particularly since the early 1990s, when resistance emerged to this agent. Interestingly, two trials (Sachs et al and Jorgensen et al) included in the analysis by Puhan et al, both not showing a significant benefit of antibiotics, used amoxicillin and were conducted in the 1990s. Two trials comparing fluoroquinolones with non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics, the GLOBE and MOSAIC trials, showed more complete clinical resolution of exacerbations and a prolonged time to the next exacerbation.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114XHeFW]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. In this section, we review (1) the epidemiology of this condition; (2) the etiology — many patients with AECOPD are thought to have a combination of viral and bacterial infections, which contribute to their exacerbation. Bacterial organisms are isolated more commonly after viral infections in patients with COPD. The role that bacterial infections play in AECOPD remains a very controversial topic; (3) the use of diagnostic procedures; (4) efficacy of antibiotics; (5) clinical parameters to stratify patients' severity; (6) different groups of antibiotics that can be used; and (7) other therapies, including bronchodilators. We summarize the current literature, with special emphasis on the assessment of the long-term impact of this condition.

Antimicrobial therapies

Pulsed fluroquinolones

The double blind, placebo-controlled RCT ' PULSE study' included over 1000 patients with COPD and a history of ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations in the previous year without colonisation with pathogens resistant to moxifloxacin. Participants were randomised to either moxifloxacin 400 mg given once daily for 5 days and repeated every 8 weeks for a total of six courses, or placebo. Patients were followed up for 6 months post end of treatment. In the intention-to-treat analysis, pulsed therapy with moxifloxacin reduced the odds of an exacerbation by 19% in patients with moderate to severe COPD, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.059). However, a post-hoc subgroup of analysis of those with mucopurulent/purulent sputum there was 15.2% absolute risk reduction in exacerbations and an NNT of 7 (p = 0.004). The safety outcomes reported no increase in rates of bacterial resistances to antibiotics, and no serious adverse events due to the treatment particularly, cardiac or Clostridium difficile infection.

### Moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin against acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the latin American cohort [^111ncFRP]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We compared the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) using a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel-group clinical trial design. A total of 563 patients with AECB were enrolled (437 efficacy-valid) at 34 centers in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Patients were randomized to oral therapy with either moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 5 days or levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 7 days. Clinical success was achieved in 201 out of 221 (91.0%) patients in the moxifloxacin group, and in 203 out of 216 (94.0%) in the levofloxacin group, indicating that moxifloxacin is equivalently effective to levofloxacin. Bacteriologic eradication or presumed eradication was also similar in the two treatment groups: 92.8% in the moxifloxacin group and 93.8% in the levofloxacin group. Nausea was the most common drug-related adverse event in each treatment group. The rate of discontinuation because of adverse events was very low (2%). In conclusion, a 5-day course of moxifloxacin is clinically and bacteriologically equivalent to a 7-day course of levofloxacin in the treatment of patients with AECB. The short treatment duration with moxifloxacin may have compliance advantages over other currently used therapies in the 'real-life' clinical setting.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Pharmacologic management of COPD exacerbations… [^115UED8i]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1, 2 Chronic lower respiratory tract diseases, including COPD, are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the third leading cause of death worldwide. 3, 4 Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations of symptoms resulting in the need for additional treatment. Acute exacerbations of COPD are generally characterized by increased dyspnea, increased frequency and severity of cough, and potentially increased sputum. 5 Patients experiencing acute exacerbations of COPD are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity, lower quality of life, increased hospital admissions, and a progressive decline in lung function. 6–13. The goals for management of acute exacerbations of COPD include symptom resolution and recovery from the exacerbation episode via improving airflow and gas exchange in addition to reducing lung inflammation. Prevention or reduction of severity of subsequent exacerbation episodes is also a goal for many management and prevention strategies.

Typical interventions used for the management of COPD exacerbations include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. Surprisingly, there is limited evidence for many of these treatments in this population. 25–27 The pooled effect size showed increased rates of clinical cure at the end of the intervention compared with placebo. This benefit was observed independently of the level of severity of the exacerbation episode and of treatment setting.
14. 25 At the end of 10 days, patients receiving doxycycline showed higher rates of clinical cure compared with those receiving placebo. A second study randomized 100 patients to receive 500 mg of a quinolone or 500 mg of amoxicillin compared with placebo for 10 days. 27 No significant differences were observed between the treatment and placebo groups.

The third trial was conducted in Spain and randomized 310 patients to receive amoxicillin or placebo. 26 Patients treated with amoxicillin had a significantly longer time to subsequent exacerbations than those receiving placebo, which was considered a measure of clinical cure. 37, 38, 40 The AAFP recommendations for managing acute exacerbations of COPD are consistent with guidance from others. 37, 38 Both systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids were observed to significantly improve symptom resolution in this population as measured by increased clinical cure rates. Treatment with antibiotics also decreased clinical failure rate. Treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment and patient preferences and values, and involve shared decision-making by the patient and clinician.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^111xu8Fw]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The risk of treatment failure without antibiotics needs to be balanced with antimicrobial resistance, contributed to by inappropriate and non-evidence based prescribing, and adverse drug effects, including Clostridium difficile infection. Primary care is an optimal environment to improve antibiotic use since 74% of all UK antibiotics are prescribed here and around three-quarters of patients presenting in primary care with an acute COPD exacerbation receive antibiotics. Moreover, a European-wide COPD audit of hospitalised patients demonstrated that antibiotics were more likely to be continued during admissions and after discharge if they had already been received in primary care.

Guidelines on antibiotics for COPD exacerbations are not specific and based only on moderate evidence. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the study period suggest using an aminopenicillin, macrolide or tetracycline but give no indication on duration. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease advises 5–7 days duration but no antibiotic class. A recent meta-analysis presented dirithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin as having the best cure and side-effect profiles, yet these are not used routinely in clinical practice.

In this study, we characterised patterns of antibiotic prescribing for COPD exacerbations via a retrospective observational analysis of primary care data from 2010 to 2015. We explored the factors associated with the risk of further antibiotic prescription, which may form the basis for future comparative interventional studies, such as clinical trials comparing different antibiotic durations, or first-line drugs in specific patient groups.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116GP5tm]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbations can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacteria involved in 50% of exacerbations. Consequently, current management of exacerbations frequently involves the use of antibiotics. The paper by Puhan et al published this month in BMC Medicine examines the benefit of antibiotics in placebo-controlled trials in mild to moderate outpatient exacerbations. The authors use a meta-analytic approach and rightly conclude that more trials are needed in this area. However, the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and exacerbations and the limited end-points in past trials do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about antibiotic use in outpatient exacerbations based on this meta-analysis. Future trials need to take into account this heterogeneity as well as incorporate novel end-points to address this important issue.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^115y9TMN]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbation diagnosis and treatment

Exacerbations of COPD remain a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and it is necessary to consider (and, where appropriate, rule out) other causes of increased breathlessness in patients with COPD presenting with symptom deteriorations. Conditions mimicking exacerbations include pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus and cardiac failure. Diagnosis of exacerbation therefore requires appropriate clinical assessment and may need further investigation with, for example, chest radiography.

The principles of exacerbation therapy have not changed greatly since the widespread introduction in the 1990s of non-invasive ventilation in preference to doxapram for the treatment of hypercapnoea at exacerbation of COPD. Therapies at exacerbation may be divided into those thought to have a disease-modifying effect, and those aiming to support respiratory function until disease-modifying therapies have had sufficient time to act.

Exacerbation therapy is administered stepwise according to the clinical severity of presentation, and a general scheme is presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that disentangling the concept of exacerbation severity from the severity of the underlying COPD is almost impossible: a patient needing intubation and ventilation at exacerbation may have milder disease with a greater acute deterioration, or more severe underlying disease and a trivial insult.

Figure 1
General scheme for management of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Therapy is added stepwise according to the severity of the presentation. Mild exacerbations may respond to an increase in the dose and/or frequency of inhaled bronchodilators alone. Exacerbations not responding to this require systemic corticosteroids, with the addition of antibiotics if there has been a change in the character of expectorated sputum. Additional interventions such as theophylline may be required where the clinical response is still incomplete. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary at any stage in the presence of new or established respiratory failure. Exacerbation management should also include an assessment and management of comorbidities, and the opportunity should be taken to optimise long-term therapies to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116SWGkW]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Variability of antibiotic prescribing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a cohort study [^1143skUq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition characterised by an obstructive pattern of expiratory airflow limitation which can't be fully reversed. An estimated 3 million people have COPD in the UK with associated annual healthcare costs of £800 million. COPD patients frequently suffer acute exacerbations of the disease, characterised by an increase in dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence. Exacerbations are often bacterial in origin and antibiotic therapy is appropriate. However, exacerbations may also be due to viral infections of the upper respiratory tract or may be non-infective. The role of antibiotics in treating mild or moderate acute exacerbation is unclear. Most randomised trials evaluating antibiotics for COPD were restricted to patients hospitalised for acute exacerbations. Of the 11 studies included in a recent review only 2 included patients from a GP setting, despite much healthcare for COPD patients being administered in this environment. Also, few of the studies provided details on resource utilisation associated with exacerbations or the effect of prescribing antibiotics on this utilisation.

Databases of electronic health records (EHR), such as those managed by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), provide the opportunity to conduct a large pragmatic randomised trial evaluating effects of antibiotics in patients with mild or moderate acute COPD exacerbations. Participants can be recruited at the point of care and followed using routinely collected EHR. A key requirement for pragmatic trials is that 'usual conditions' apply to the research setting. The selection and monitoring of patients should ideally mimic the 'real world'. The only difference should be the random allocation of the interventions rather than the investigators deciding how to treat patients. Such a trial is currently being conducted within CPRD, and the present study was initiated in order to provide background information about current medical practice and outcomes of COPD exacerbations. The objectives were to: (i) describe the patient characteristics associated with acute exacerbations amongst a representative COPD population, (ii) explore the relationship between COPD severity and outcomes amongst patients with exacerbations, and (iii) quantify variability by practice in prescribing of antibiotics for exacerbations.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^115Qdjjo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Consequences of Inappropriate Fluoroquinolone Use

Inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents has been associated with adverse consequences, including therapeutic failure, development of resistance, and increased health-care costs. One example of a mismatch between pharmacodynamics and clinical infection was in the use of ciprofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. The pharmacodynamics of the dose typically prescribed in these cases (ciprofloxacin 250 mg b.i.d.) are inappropriate for treating pneumococcal pneumonia, especially in seriously ill patients. By 1994, approximately 15 cases of S. pneumoniae infections that did not respond to ciprofloxacin had been reported, primarily in seriously ill patients and associated with contraindicated medications and other important medical issues. These events prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to modify the package insert to warn against empiric use of ciprofloxacin for respiratory infections in which S. pneumoniae would be a primary pathogen. Consequently, ciprofloxacin has been used less frequently in these types of infections.

By contrast, > 50% of levofloxacin use has been for the treatment of respiratory infections. Since 1999, at least 20 case reports of pulmonary infections that did not respond to levofloxacin therapy have been published (, –). Three of the patients died due to fulminant pneumococcal infections that were unresponsive to levofloxacin therapy at approved dosage. Very few of these cases were in immunosuppressed patients. Reports of pneumococcal failures on the standard dosage of levofloxacin, 500 mg every 24 h, have also been described in two clinical trials, one in a patient with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and the other in a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (Table 4). In some of the 21 case reports, the treatment failed, and the pathogen developed levofloxacin resistance during therapy.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^112eeWn5]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory condition projected to become the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2060, accounting for an estimated 5.4 million deaths annually. COPD imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems and is associated with high rates of early mortality. Patients who experience frequent exacerbations suffer from reduced quality of life, accelerated decline in lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and increased mortality. A history of previous exacerbations remains the strongest predictor of future episodes.

Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are often complicated by respiratory infections, which can intensify inflammation and contribute to progressive airway damage. A systematic review indicated that bacterial infections are present in approximately 50% of exacerbation cases. However, current preventive strategies outlined in the GOLD guidelines are limited to one antibiotic, azithromycin, and two vaccines, leaving a significant gap in effective prophylactic therapies. The complex interplay of factors that trigger exacerbations suggests that more comprehensive management strategies are needed.

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^114ziMd3]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the out-patient and in-patient settings.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114jFyVs]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^115hpsKm]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115tzrmC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, we suggest the use of triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA rather than dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, ICU admissions, dyspnea, and health-related QOL as critical outcomes.

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with zero to less than one exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 1,482 citations in MEDLINE (n = 668), Embase (n = 768), and the Cochrane Library (n = 46), with deduplication resulting in n = 1,102 warranting screening. An additional two studies were identified through other means. The majority (99.5%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, and this resulted in screeners identifying four studies for final review inclusion. The four identified studies were multicenter RCTs (,–). The total sample size for the four RCTs was 9,313 participants; 5,700 (61.2%) of these participants were in the treatment/intervention arms and 3,613 (38.8%) were in the control (comparator) arms. Three of the four studies enrolled patients with a history of one or more exacerbations per year. In one study, patients were not required to have had an exacerbation in the past year.

### Head-to-head oral prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115mKXrM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.

Main Results

We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.

Exacerbations are a characteristic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contribute significantly to associated morbidity and mortality. Renewed interest in this common clinical problem and research using new investigative tools has enhanced substantially the understanding of the pathogenesis of exacerbations. Results of recent clinical trials and observational studies have allowed refinements in treatment of exacerbations that should im-prove patient outcomes. This article discusses a rational, stratified approach to the use of antibiotics for this condition based on these recent studies.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

### Standard versus newer antibacterial agents in the treatment of severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus ciprofloxacin [^112EWEoy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND. Although the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is largely accepted, controversy remains regarding whether the choice of antibiotic has any impact on outcome. Our aim was to compare the effects of the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin in patients treated for severe COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, we included 170 patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation. Enrolled patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 85) or ciprofloxacin (n = 85) for 10 days. Main outcomes were hospital death and need for an additional course of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and exacerbation-free interval. RESULTS. Combined hospital death and additional antibiotic prescription rates were similar in the 2 groups (16.4% vs 15.3% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs ciprofloxacin group; difference, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.8% to 12.0%; P = 0.832). Hospital death occurred in 7 patients (8.2%) receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 8 patients (9.4%) receiving ciprofloxacin (difference, -1.2%; 95% CI, -9.7 to 7.3; P = 0.90). The need for an additional antibiotic course was observed in 8 patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 5 patients in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -5.4 to 10.0; P = 0.549). The mean exacerbation-free interval (± standard deviation) was similar in both treatment groups (83 ± 25 vs 79 ± 22 for the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs ciprofloxacin group; difference, 4 days; 95% CI, -15 to 19 days; P = 0.41). Duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with acute exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation, efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not inferior to ciprofloxacin. Trial registration.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1174DZsj]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) theophylline — efficacy, safety, and interactions are summarized as follows: Theophylline is metabolized by cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidases, and clearance declines with age. There is evidence for a modest bronchodilator effect compared with placebo in stable COPD, and addition of theophylline to salmeterol produces a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and breathlessness than salmeterol alone; however, adding low‑dose theophylline to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients at increased risk of exacerbation showed no difference versus placebo in COPD exacerbations over a one‑year period, and a large placebo‑controlled trial showed no effect of oral theophylline alone or combined with prednisolone 5 mg daily on exacerbations of severe COPD. Toxicity is dose‑related because the therapeutic ratio is small and most benefit occurs only when near‑toxic doses are given; problems include atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (which can prove fatal) and grand mal convulsions, and other side effects such as headaches, insomnia, nausea, and heartburn may occur within the therapeutic range; significant interactions occur with erythromycin (but not azithromycin), ciprofloxacin (but not ofloxacin), allopurinol, cimetidine (but not ranitidine), fluvoxamine, and the 5‑lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton.

### Managing acute respiratory failure during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116hiooU]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major health problem, causing more than half a million hospital admissions per year in the United States. Although overall mortality is low, it is substantially higher with severe exacerbations that require intensive care and mechanical ventilation. The majority of COPD exacerbations result from infection, with typical bacterial organisms most commonly identified. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have documented the benefits of antibiotics, low-flow oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids, and the therapeutic equivalency of the major classes of bronchodilators (short-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergics). Randomized controlled trials also demonstrate that noninvasive ventilation can decrease the incidence of intubation, shorten stay, reduce infectious complications, and improve survival. Although patients who require intubation have the worst prognosis, the vast majority of them can be successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. For invasively ventilated patients the clinical emphasis should be on improving patient-ventilator interaction and avoiding dynamic hyperinflation (intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure).

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116LdoMD]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Severity of exacerbations

Puhan et al have grouped together mild and moderate exacerbations based on the site of treatment, that is, outpatient treatment. This classification is clearly very broad as the site of care will vary among countries and healthcare systems as well as with patient and physician preferences. Furthermore, over time, changes in healthcare delivery and results of outcome studies can change the site of care for the same severity of exacerbation. A 40-year-old smoker without underlying airway obstruction, infrequent exacerbations and free of comorbid conditions would have been included as a 'mild to moderate' exacerbation. On the other hand, a patient with severe COPD, frequent exacerbations and comorbid conditions who does not require hospitalization would also be classified as a 'mild to moderate exacerbation'. In the former patient, it is possible that host immunity can adequately deal with the infection and the exacerbation will spontaneously resolve. In the latter patient, such resolution is less likely and complications are more frequent. Grouping these patients together can lead to confusing and contradictory results.

The severity of an exacerbation is a complicated concept, constituted by at least two factors, the severity of the underlying COPD and the acute change induced by the exacerbation itself. Therefore, a patient with severe underlying COPD will have significant clinical consequences from a relatively small change from the baseline state, while a patient with mild COPD will tolerate a much larger change in symptoms and lung function. It is evident that we need more objective measures of severity of exacerbations. Ongoing developmental efforts in patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers should provide us with such tools in the future, and allow for trials to be pooled as attempted by Puhan et al here.

Outpatients ≥ 45 years old with stable chronic bronchitis, smoking history of ≥ 20 pack-years, two or more AECBs in the previous year, and FEV(1) < 85% of predicted value. Patients were enrolled when in a stable condition, and patients with exacerbations within 12 months of enrollment were randomized.

Interventions

Randomization (stratified on steroid use) between moxifloxacin (400 mg qd for 5 days) and standard therapy (amoxicillin [500 mg tid for 7 days], clarithromycin [500 mg bid for 7 days], or cefuroxime-axetil [250 mg bid for 7 days]).

Measurements

Assessment at enrollment, randomization (Anthonisen type 1 exacerbation), 7 to 10 days after treatment, and monthly until next AECB or up to 9 months. The primary efficacy variable was clinical success (sufficient improvement, no alternative antimicrobial therapy required) 7 to 10 days after therapy. Secondary predefined end points were clinical cure (return to pre-exacerbation status), further antimicrobial use, time to next AECB, and bacteriologic success.

Results

Three hundred fifty-four patients received moxifloxacin, and 376 patients received standard therapy. At 7 to 10 days after therapy, clinical success rates were similar in intention-to-treat (ITT) patients (95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.7 to 9.5) and per-protocol (PP) patients (95% CI, - 3.0 to 8.5). Moxifloxacin showed superior clinical cure rates over standard therapy in both ITT patients (95% CI, 1.4 to 14.9) and PP patients (95% CI, 0.3 to 15.6), and higher bacteriologic success in microbiologically valid patients (95% CI, 0.4 to 22.1). Fewer ITT patients required antimicrobials after treatment with moxifloxacin than standard therapy (p < 0.01). Time to next exacerbation was longer with moxifloxacin; median and mean times to new AECBs in ITT patients who did not require any further antibiotics were 131.0 days and 132.8 days in moxifloxacin, and 103.5 days and 118.0 days in standard therapy, respectively (p = 0.03). The occurrence of failure, new exacerbation, or any further antibiotic was less frequent in moxifloxacin-treated patients for up to 5 months of follow-up (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Moxifloxacin was equivalent to standard therapy for clinical success and showed superiority over standard therapy in clinical cure, bacteriologic eradication, and long-term outcomes.

### A randomized, double-blind study comparing 5 days oral gemifloxacin with 7 days oral levofloxacin in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis [^111ScLDM]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate that 5 days of treatment with a new fluoroquinolone, gemifloxacin, is at least as effective as 7 days of treatment with levofloxacin in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, double dummy, multicentre, parallel group study

Setting

Sixty different medical centers in US, UK and Germany.

Material and Methods

A total of 360 adults (> 40 years of age) with AECB were randomly assigned to receive gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily for 5 days or levofloxacin 500mg once daily for 7 days. The primary efficacy parameter was a clinical response at follow-up (Days 14–21).

Results

In total, 335/360 patients completed the study (93.1%). Seven patients receiving gemifloxacin withdrew from the study compared to 18 patients receiving levofloxacin; this difference was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test: p = 0.02). In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the clinical success rate at follow-up (Days 14–21) was 85.2% (155/182) with gemifloxacin and 78.1% (139/178) with levofloxacin. Clinical success rate in the per-protocol (PP) population was 88.2% (134/152) with gemifloxacin and 85.1% (126/148) with levofloxacin. At long-term follow-up (Days 28–35), the clinical success rates in the PP population were 83.7% (123/147) with gemifloxacin and 78.4% (109/139) with levofloxacin. The difference in success rates was 5.26% (95% CI: -3.83, 14.34).

Conclusion

The clinical efficacy of gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily for 5 days in AECB was at least as good as levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 7 days. Fewer withdrawals and superior clinical efficacy at long-term follow-up were also seen with gemifloxacin.

### Antibiotic retreatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116ZrQip]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies that have examined the symptomatic resolution of exacerbations with validated patient-reported outcome tools have shown that the median time to symptomatic resolution ranges from 9 to 16.5 days. However, there is considerable variation around this time frame, and some patients who are destined to recover have not yet reached their baseline level of symptoms 14 days after the initial onset of their exacerbation. These slow resolvers appear to be a significant proportion of the patients included in this study, as evidenced by the fact that the median time to full resolution of symptoms following randomization to retreatment was only 3 days in those treated with antibiotics and 4 days in the group treated with placebo. If these patients were indeed experiencing a persistent or superimposed bacterial infection, spontaneous resolution in 3 to 4 days would be highly unusual.

Understanding the value of an antibiotic treatment is enhanced by corresponding bacteriological data. If exacerbations are suspected to be bacterial, sputum yields potential pathogens in about half the instances. If bacterial persistence or superinfection are mechanisms of exacerbation nonresolution, then antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Moraxella catarrhalis should be prevalent. In fact, the recognition of M. catarrhalis as an important cause of COPD exacerbations came from several reports of patients failing treatment with a β-lactam antibiotic who were infected with a β-lactamase–producing strain of this pathogen. In this study, only 32% of patients could provide a sputum sample for bacteriology and only 15% of randomized patients had sputum that yielded a positive bacterial culture. This is not surprising given that most patients had very mild symptoms and did not display clinical characteristics suggesting they had a bacterial infection.

B

Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing Pa CO 2. The GOLD 2023 report recommends continuing treatments with long-acting bronchodilators during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects.

G

Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, and risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration. Nebulized budesonide may be a suitable alternative to systemic corticosteroids in some patients. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat COPD exacerbations in patients with lower blood eosinophil levels.

A

Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days. The choice of antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. Usually, initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected patients, quinolone. In patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other materials from the lung should be performed, as gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above-mentioned antibiotics may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to ingest medications and the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic.

A

Additional therapies may be indicated to maintain appropriate fluid balance, treat the comorbidities, and monitor nutritional aspects. Hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. At all times, healthcare providers should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.
