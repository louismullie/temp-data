## Question

What are the common symptoms of trichomoniasis in male patients who do exhibit symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of trichomoniasis in male patients who actually exhibit symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and how often men are asymptomatic. Then, I should verify which male syndromes are most commonly linked to symptomatic trichomoniasis. Next, I will enumerate the specific symptoms and signs that tend to appear, and I should double-check whether discharge characteristics differ from other urethritis etiologies. After that, I need to consider less common but clinically relevant sequelae like epididymitis and prostatitis. Finally, I will integrate prevalence context and diagnostic implications to frame how "common" these symptoms are when men are symptomatic, and I will cite high-quality guidelines and studies to anchor each point.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: most men with Trichomonas vaginalis are asymptomatic, so when we talk about "common symptoms", we are describing the subset who actually have clinical manifestations. The CDC notes that 70–85% of persons with trichomoniasis have minimal or no genital symptoms, and men are frequently asymptomatic carriers, which means symptomatic presentations are the minority and often underrecognized [^79a06aa0] [^9b44fa09].

> I will now examine the primary symptomatic syndrome in men, which is urethritis. Wait, let me verify the specific manifestations: men with symptomatic trichomoniasis typically present with urethral discharge, dysuria, and urethral irritation or itching, aligning with nongonococcal urethritis features. Importantly, discharge may be clear, white, or mucopurulent, and symptoms can be mild to moderate, which can overlap with other NGU etiologies and delay recognition of T. vaginalis as the cause [^79a06aa0] [^0c74b851] [^e8689ad3].

> Hold on, I should verify whether discharge characteristics help distinguish trichomonas urethritis from other causes. In a retrospective ED cohort of 2137 men undergoing STI testing, those who were TV-positive were significantly more likely to have clear penile discharge on examination, which supports the clinical observation that clear discharge can be a clue to trichomonas in the right epidemiologic context, though overlap remains substantial and diagnosis should be confirmed by testing [^26661cb6].

> Next, I should review less common but clinically important sequelae. Let me consider epididymitis and prostatitis: guidelines and reviews note that T. vaginalis can occasionally cause epididymitis or prostatitis, typically presenting with scrotal pain, swelling, or perineal and pelvic discomfort, and sometimes with ejaculatory pain. These presentations are less frequent than urethritis but should be kept in mind, especially when standard bacterial etiologies are not identified or symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy [^79a06aa0] [^9b44fa09] [^5da54300].

> I need to ensure I contextualize how "common" these symptoms are when men are actually symptomatic. In partner studies, roughly 70–77% of infected men are asymptomatic, so symptomatic men represent a minority; among those who are symptomatic, urethritis predominates, with discharge and dysuria being the most frequent complaints, whereas epididymitis and prostatitis are less common but recognized complications. This pattern fits with broader urethritis frameworks where trichomonas is an established, albeit variable, contributor to NGU depending on population and diagnostics [^71a2b899] [^79a06aa0] [^0c74b851].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or recur after treatment? I should double-check guidance on persistent or recurrent urethritis. The CDC advises that if symptoms persist or recur after appropriate therapy, clinicians should re-evaluate and test for Mycoplasma genitalium and T. vaginalis, underscoring that trichomonas can be a culprit in treatment failure or persistent NGU and should be actively considered in the differential when initial management fails [^5da54300] [^7adaeef1].

> Let me synthesize the clinical picture succinctly: in men who are symptomatic from Trichomonas vaginalis, the most common presentation is urethritis with urethral discharge (often clear but can be white or mucopurulent), dysuria, and urethral itching or burning. Less commonly, men may develop epididymitis with scrotal pain and swelling, or prostatitis with perineal or pelvic pain and ejaculatory discomfort. Given the high proportion of asymptomatic infections, any of these findings in the right context should prompt targeted testing rather than presumptive exclusion of trichomonas [^79a06aa0] [^26661cb6] [^5da54300].

---

In symptomatic men, trichomoniasis most often presents as **urethritis** with clear or mucopurulent discharge, dysuria, and urethral irritation or itching [^79a06aa0] [^26661cb6]. Less commonly, it causes **epididymitis** (scrotal pain, swelling, and tenderness) [^79a06aa0] or **prostatitis** (perineal or pelvic pain, frequency, urgency, and pain with ejaculation) [^9b44fa09]. Symptoms are typically mild to moderate and may be intermittent, which contributes to underdiagnosis [^9b44fa09]. Because most men are asymptomatic, any of these findings should prompt testing and treatment, with partner management to prevent reinfection [^71a2b899] [^5d60904f].

## Common symptoms in symptomatic males

### Urethritis

Urethritis is the **most frequent manifestation** in symptomatic men, characterized by:

- **Urethral discharge**: Typically clear or mucopurulent; less purulent than gonorrhea and often subtle or intermittent [^26661cb6].

- **Dysuria**: Burning or discomfort during urination, usually mild to moderate [^notfound].

- **Urethral irritation or itching**: Persistent or intermittent discomfort localized to the urethra [^0c74b851].

These symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with other causes of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, so **diagnostic confirmation is essential** [^0c74b851].

---

### Epididymitis

Trichomonas vaginalis can ascend to the epididymis, causing **epididymitis** with the following features:

- **Scrotal pain**: Gradual onset, typically unilateral, and may radiate to the groin or lower abdomen [^notfound].

- **Swelling and tenderness**: Localized to the posterior aspect of the testis, with possible erythema and edema of the scrotum [^notfound].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever and malaise are uncommon but may occur in severe cases [^notfound].

---

### Prostatitis

Involvement of the prostate gland is less common but may present with **chronic pelvic or perineal pain**, urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria, as well as pain during or after ejaculation and discomfort with ejaculation or hematospermia. These features are consistent with chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome and may persist beyond 3 months if untreated [^5da54300].

---

## Frequency and severity of symptoms

Symptomatic trichomoniasis in men is generally **mild to moderate** and may be intermittent, leading to underrecognition and delayed care [^9b44fa09]. The severity and persistence of symptoms can vary with host factors such as age, immune status, and coinfections (e.g. HIV), with HIV-positive men more often experiencing severe or persistent symptoms [^b94cbf18].

---

## Comparison with other sexually transmitted infections

Trichomoniasis symptoms in men are less specific and often milder than those of gonorrhea or chlamydia, contributing to underdiagnosis. Unlike gonorrhea, which typically presents with **purulent discharge and marked dysuria**, trichomoniasis usually causes a clear or mucopurulent discharge with milder dysuria [^notfound]. Compared with chlamydia, trichomoniasis is more often associated with **urethral irritation and itching** than with overt discharge [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Given the nonspecific nature of symptoms, **diagnostic confirmation is critical**:

- **Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)**: Highly sensitive and specific for T. vaginalis in urine or urethral swabs [^6d4d897d].

- **Wet mount microscopy**: Rapid but less sensitive; motile trichomonads may be seen in urethral discharge or urine sediment [^c28e851e].

- **Culture**: More sensitive than wet mount but slower and less practical for routine use [^52d9aa3f].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Symptomatic trichomoniasis in men is important because it:

- **Facilitates HIV transmission**: Increases risk of HIV acquisition and transmission [^79a06aa0].

- **Causes reproductive morbidity**: Linked to epididymitis, prostatitis, and possible infertility [^9b44fa09].

- **Perpetuates transmission**: Infected men often remain untreated, serving as reservoirs for reinfection of partners [^71a2b899].

Treatment with **metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose** is recommended for symptomatic men, with concurrent treatment of sexual partners to prevent reinfection [^6d5ffb43] [^5d60904f].

---

In symptomatic men, trichomoniasis most often presents as **urethritis** with discharge, dysuria, and urethral irritation; less commonly, it causes epididymitis or prostatitis. Symptoms are typically mild to moderate and nonspecific, so **testing and partner treatment are essential** to reduce transmission and complications [^79a06aa0] [^5d60904f].

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infections [^f0196e26]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals. This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection. Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common human parasitic infections in the United States, as well as the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection. However, it has long received much less consideration than other parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases. Much of this inattention can be attributed to a poor understanding of the public health impact of trichomoniasis. Increasing recognition of the sequelae of infection, including increased risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, has led to increased interest in T. vaginalis. Recent innovations include development of diagnostic tests that could improve detection of the parasite. A number of important questions, such as the epidemiology among men and women, the true public health burden of symptomatic and asymptomatic T. vaginalis infections, and whether current treatments will be adequate to reduce the substantial health disparities and costs associated with trichomoniasis, need consideration to remedy neglect of this important disease.

### Prevalence of trichomonas vaginalis infection among US males, 2013–2016 [^44a733a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichomoniasis results from adhesion of Trichomonas vaginalis to the mucous membrane of the urethra or vagina. It has been estimated to have a higher incidence rate than both gonorrhea and chlamydia combined. Although females can experience both clinical symptoms and obstetrical complications, male infections are largely asymptomatic and often unreported. We aim to estimate the prevalence of trichomoniasis in US males using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database.

Methods

The NHANES database was queried for all men aged 18–59 years during the years 2013–2016. During these years, the survey included urine testing for trichomoniasis using transcription-mediated amplification. Information was also obtained regarding patient demographics and other sexually transmitted infections.

Results

Overall, 0.49% of men aged 18–59 years tested positive for trichomoniasis. The highest rate was seen in black men (3.6%). There was no significant association with trichomoniasis and age. Higher rates of infection were seen in smokers, those with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, men who had sex at an early age, those with less condom usage, and those with more lifetime sexual partners.

Conclusion

The rates of trichomonas infection in US males are lower than in women. Infections are strongly associated with black males, HSV-2 infection, and other factors known to increase rates of sexually transmitted infection. This information may be helpful for counseling, screening, and management of patients.

INTRODUCTION

is considered one of the most common curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating 156 million cases in 2016, a higher prevalence than, or syphilis.is currently not a reportable disease and the true estimation of disease prevalence is not currently known. Some of the factors contributing to this are a lack of routine testing and nonspecific symptomatology, and infected men being predominantly asymptomatic.

A large proportion ofinfections are asymptomatic; however, symptoms can include urethral discharge, primarily in males, and abnormal vaginal discharge, dysuria, itching, irritation, and abdominal pain in females. The consequences of untreatedinfection may include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and adverse outcomes of pregnancy.infection has also been shown to increase the risk of HIV by 50% via several mechanisms, including damage to the vaginal epithelial membrane by the protozoa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that women presenting with symptoms are tested for, but do not recommend generalized screening of asymptomatic women. However, screening is recommended for women living in areas with higher than average prevalence or those who report behaviors that may have resulted in exposure to STIs, or who are HIV positive. Coinfection ofwithand/orin women has been previously reported and symptoms can overlap between infections. Therefore, infections may be missed and left untreated ifand/orpositivity is presumed to be the cause. In populations with high levels of STI exposure, the inclusion oftesting alongside/testing is likely to dramatically increase case finding. A study by Sena et al. looked at the prevalence ofinfections in the male partners of women with trichomoniasis and observed that 71.7% of the men were also infected, of which 77.3% were asymptomatic. Men are seldom tested forat the time of testing for/due to a lack of recommendations and testing methodologies, which is further complicated by the largely asymptomatic nature ofinfections. Reliable testing platforms and more data are needed to understand the true prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, particularly in male populations.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^48537dba]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis — epidemiology, prevalence, transmission, prevention, and morbidity in U.S. populations: Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States, and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis. Population-based prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among males, with highest rates among Black females (9.6%) and Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%). In STD clinics, prevalence was 14.6% among women, and among Birmingham, Alabama, STD clinic attendees it was 27% among women and 9.8% among men. Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%), and rates are high in incarcerated populations at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3.2%–8% of incarcerated men. The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis (70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, transmission is readily passed during penile-vaginal sex and can occur through infected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex with women, and prevention is best through consistent and correct use of condoms (external or internal). Douching is not recommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal infections, including trichomoniasis, and reported morbidities include a 1.4-times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age and a 2.1-fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis; another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of trichomonas vaginalis in men [^9b44fa09]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

Model Structure and Probability of Key Clinical Outcomes

We used probability trees to model clinical outcomes of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, adapted from a model framework described in Li et al. We assumed a similar set of secondary outcomes for all 3 STIs examined using the same probability-tree structures, but as relevant allowed model input values (ie, probabilities, durations, and utility) to vary across the 3 STIs. Separate trees were specified for men and women (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

Figure 1.
Probability tree for sequelae of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis among women (Panel A), with complications of PID shown in Panel B. Abbreviations: CPP, chronic pelvic pain; EP, ectopic pregnancy; PID, pelvic inflammatory disease; TFI, tubal factor infertility.

Figure 2.
Probability tree for sequelae of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis among men. Abbreviation: EDS, epididymitis.

For women, each STI was categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic with different durations of infections, which determined the probability of developing PID and subsequent complications (Figure 1). Although treatment for infections is not explicitly distinguished as a separate branch in Figure 1, the estimated durations of infections accounted for the fraction of cases treated. Possible complications following PID were CPP, EP, and TFI (Figure 1 B). The probability that an infection would be symptomatic was derived from estimates from Kreisel et al and Lewis et al. Proportions of treated symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, and durations of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (distinct for treated or untreated) were estimated based on the parameters in these studies (Supplementary Material Section 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Probabilities of PID and sequelae (CPP, EP, and TFI) were estimated based on synthesizing evidence (Supplementary Material Section 3).

For men, infections were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic urethral infections (Figure 2). We assumed that urethritis was present in all symptomatic infections for the duration from symptom onset to testing due to symptoms (Supplementary Table 1), and that urethritis was not present in asymptomatic infections. There is sparse evidence on the relationship between duration of infection and sequelae development for men, and EDS was modeled using a probability that was independent of duration (Supplementary Material Section 3).

Methods

Search strategy

We systematically searched Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), PubMed, and African Index Medicus from 1 January 2000 to 17 September 2024 for studies assessing the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis in sub-Saharan Africa. Search term domains included relevant terms and synonyms for "sexually transmitted infections" and "sub-Saharan Africa" (Supplementary Table S1). We also searched citations from relevant published systematic reviews.,

Eligibility criteria and study selection

We included studies reporting sex-stratified empirical data on the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or trichomoniasis among adults from the general population in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2024. We considered studies to represent the general population if they enrolled participants from antenatal care (ANC), family planning, or gynaecology clinics; primary healthcare or other outpatient services; educational institutions; or community venues (e.g. social spaces or places of worship); or recruited participants for HIV or STI prevention trials (baseline data only) or population-representative surveys. Studies were eligible regardless of participants' symptom status, though we excluded those that exclusively enrolled symptomatic individuals or individuals seeking treatment for STIs or infertility. We excluded studies with participants enrolled exclusively from populations living with HIV or key populations.

We included studies with participants aged 12 years or older who were tested using internationally recognised aetiologic diagnostic tests with urogenital specimens (urine, urethral, or cervicovaginal samples), and excluded studies that only collected pharyngeal or rectal samples. We also excluded case reports, commentaries, longitudinal and randomised controlled studies reporting only post-baseline outcomes, and studies with fewer than 15 participants. We used the UN M49 standard to define sub-Saharan Africa and its sub-regions (Supplementary Table S2).

Search results were managed and de-duplicated using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Researchers (DMR, EM, JM, JWI-E, JK, LH, MKW, OE, OS, QH, RLA, SK) independently double-screened title and abstract records for eligibility and assessed full text articles for inclusion. A third reviewer resolved discrepancies.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States. Although trichomoniasis is common, it has been considered a "neglected" sexually transmitted disease, due to limited knowledge of its sequelae and associated costs. This article reviews current epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, clinical management recommendations and special considerations, research on associated conditions and costs, prevention strategies, and controversies regarding trichomoniasis.

Sensitivity Analysis

We performed multivariate sensitivity analyses accounting for uncertainty in (1) incidence in each subpopulation (sex and age group), (2) probabilities that infections are symptomatic, (3) probabilities of infected persons receiving treatment by each subpopulation and symptom status, (4) durations of infections by subpopulation and symptom status, (5) sequelae probabilities, (6) durations of sequelae, and (7) utility values associated with each health outcome. Input parameters were drawn from the distributions estimated by studies in Supplementary Table 7.

We conducted additional sensitivity analyses on the discount rate and our quality-of-life assumptions. First, we present undiscounted estimates in addition to the base case estimates that used a 3% discount rate. Second, we conducted 2 sensitivity analyses around the choice of utility values and sequelae durations to represent extreme cases, including (1) using utility estimates from the GBD Disability Weights study with duration of chronic sequelae fixed at 5 years (Supplementary Table 4a) for a lower extreme on QALYs; and (2) using utility estimates from the IOM with lifetime duration of chronic sequelae (Supplementary Table 4c) for an upper extreme.

We sampled parameters 1000 times independently from the parameters' distributions reported in Table 1. We ran the probability-tree models with the sampled parameter sets for the main and sensitivity analyses separately. We calculated mean and 95% uncertainty intervals values for each study outcome.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^1eed8247]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

### Epidemiology of chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States – 2005 [^2d82a629]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence and incidence of chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis are unacceptably high in the United States. The prevalence of gonorrhea is substantially lower than chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis; in part, this is presumably due to the greater frequency of symptomatic disease. The disparity between racial/ethnic groups is considerable for each of these infections. Greater effort must be devoted to reducing this disparity and to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease persistence in the United States.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^6b4bdf3e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis treatment — recommended regimens for women and men: For women, the recommended regimen is Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days; for men, the recommended regimen is Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^4e684d4b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission. Treatment recommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly symptomatic women without HIV infection. The study demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of women retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, compared with women who received the 2-g single dose. No published randomized trials are available that compare these doses among men.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Men
Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose
Alternative Regimen for Women and Men
Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. Tinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution.

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.

Other Management Considerations

Providers should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections to abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e. when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons with T. vaginalis.

Follow-Up

Because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated for trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended for all sexually active women < 3 months after initial treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient to support retesting men after treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^79a06aa0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis (70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, and untreated infections might last from months to years. Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have symptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women with trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which can be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without vulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, which is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical examination. Although many persons might be unaware of their infection, it is readily passed between sex partners during penile-vaginal sex or through transmission of infected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex with women.

Among persons who are sexually active, the best way to prevent genital trichomoniasis is through consistent and correct use of condoms (external or internal). Partners of men who have been circumcised might have a somewhat reduced risk for T. vaginalis infection. Douching is not recommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal infections, including trichomoniasis.

T. vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been reported to be associated with a 1.4-times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age. T. vaginalis was also determined to be associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis. Another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer.

T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and is associated with an increase in HIV vaginal shedding, which is reduced with T. vaginalis treatment among women without viral suppression. Among women with HIV infection, T. vaginalis infection is associated with increased risk for PID.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^0e3e5cf0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis in nonpregnant patients — caused by Trichomonas vaginalis — is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with approximately 3–5 million cases annually; African American women are ten times more commonly affected compared with non-Hispanic white women; More than 50% of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, whereas symptomatic patients may report abnormal vaginal discharge, itching, burning, or postcoital bleeding; because asymptomatic carriage can occur for prolonged periods in men and women, a recent diagnosis does not necessarily establish recent acquisition unless prior negative Trichomonas testing is documented.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection.

### Trichomoniasis: under control or undercontrolled? [^ecd177a3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Aside from human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, yet it has long been regarded as a sexually transmitted infection of minor importance. Medical opinion has traditionally held that it plays little role in health complications in women, and it is rarely seen in men. However, evidence has recently accumulated implicating Trichomonas vaginalis as a contributor to a variety of adverse outcomes among both sexes. Among both women and men, the association of T vaginalis with human immunodeficiency acquisition and transmission has been shown in multiple studies. Among women, trichomoniasis may play a role in development of cervical neoplasia, postoperative infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes and as a factor in atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Among men, trichomoniasis has emerged as a cause of nongonoccocal urethritis and as contributing to male factor infertility. As evidence continues to accumulate, the time has come to increase diagnostic efforts beyond traditional sexually transmitted disease clinic settings.

### The estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost due to Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States in 2018 [^3f202267]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Substantial uncertainty around the probability of developing PID from trichomoniasis limited the estimate's reliability. We varied this probability from 0 to 0.79 (relative to the probability of PID due to chlamydia), in line with high variability across previous studies. The large uncertainty in estimates of QALYs lost from trichomoniasis reflects the data gaps in the natural history of trichomoniasis. We relied on estimates of incidence, probabilities of symptoms, and natural clearance rate from 2 modeling studies, which used similar methodology across the infections, and represent the most up-to-date evidence of the epidemiology of these infections. Reliance on one source per STI for infection epidemiology is a limitation and reflects data gaps in the field.

We did not include QALYs lost associated with STI-associated HIV infections, or pregnancy-related adverse outcomes due to the STIs, given relatively limited evidence base on the proportion of these outcomes that are attributable to the 3 STIs compared to the direct consequences emphasized in our study. Rigorous epidemiological studies are needed to improve our understanding of the role of specific STIs and the many confounding factors present. The restriction of the analysis to a small number of selected sequelae reflects current evidence on the burden of STIs and results in conservative estimates. Like any mathematical modelling study, our estimation relied on a number of simplifying assumptions. For example, we assumed that the probability of PID for women with gonorrhea was the same as for chlamydia, and we did not consider the increasing risk of PID among women with repeated chlamydial infection. Gonorrhea may be associated with higher probability of PID than chlamydia and repeated infections may increase the risk of PID and sequelae, and our estimates of QALYs lost due to chlamydia and gonorrhea for women could be underestimated.

Our study provides comprehensive estimates of the lifetime QALYs lost per incident infection and overall population health burden of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis acquired in 2018. Estimates of lifetime QALYs lost for incident STIs in the United States are valuable for informing cost-effectiveness analyses of STIs prevention interventions and prioritizing prevention policies. Our detailed documentation of methodology allows future studies to adjust relevant parameters and select appropriate estimates for their research question. We hope our findings from sensitivity analyses promote more research into these important but poorly estimated parameters in the future.

### Trichomoniasis: clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management [^c28e851e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis was originally considered a commensal organism until the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) began to evolve. Trichomoniasis has been associated with vaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and adverse birth outcomes. Infection with T vaginalis could have an important role in transmission and acquisition of HIV. T vaginalis is site specific for the genitourinary tract and has been isolated from virtually all genitourinary structures. Asymptomatic disease is common in both men and women, thus screening for disease is important. Various sociodemographic factors have been correlated with presence of T vaginalis, and may be used to predict infection. Diagnosis is usually made from wet mount microscopy and direct visualisation, which are insensitive. DNA amplification techniques perform with good sensitivity, but are not yet approved for diagnostic purposes. In areas where diagnostic methods are limited, management of trichomoniasis is usually as part of a clinical syndrome; vaginal discharge for women and urethral discharge for men. A single dose of metronidazole is effective in the majority of cases. Outside of the United States, other nitroimidazoles may be used and are as effective as metronidazole. Metronidazole resistance is an emerging problem, but its clinical importance is not yet clear. Concomitant treatment of sexual partners is recommended.

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis, and symptoms alone without objective signs are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men with pain or voiding symptoms lasting for > 3 months, and men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

### Trichomoniasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^b4cc28af]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women. Rates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3. 2%–8% of incarcerated men. Women with BV are at higher risk for T. vaginalis. Male partners of women with trichomoniasis are likely to have infection, although the prevalence of trichomoniasis among MSM is low. The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis either have minimal or no genital symptoms, and untreated infections might last from months to years.

Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have symptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women with trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which can be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without vulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, which is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical examination. Extragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon compared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San Francisco, California, reported a 0. 6% rate of rectal T. vaginalis; however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis DNA and not necessarily active infection. Neither the Osom assay nor the Affirm VP III test is FDA cleared for use with specimens from men. Culture, such as the InPouch system, was considered the most sensitive method for diagnosing.

Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against.

### Advances and challenges in sexually transmitted infections prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia [^6fdabf7e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, there are over 30 known pathogens (i.e. bacteria, viruses, or parasites), which are exclusively or predominantly transmitted through sexual contact or transmissible during sexual contact. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), > 1 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired every day worldwide, the majority of which are asymptomatic. Each year, there are an estimated 374 million new infections with one of four STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) is a population with high risk of SITs. For example, WHO reported that syphilis is highly prevalent among MSM worldwide. Recently, studies have also shown that the MSM is the high-risk group attracted by STIs. For example, a study in England showed that the most common route of STI transmission in England changed from heterosexual men (40.4%) in 2014 to MSM (36.7%) in 2019, with a 76% increase during this period among MSM. Another research reported that the prevalence of syphilis was higher among people with HIV (7.1% among MSM with HIV and 3.4% without HIV). Other major STIs were prevalent among MSM as well. In a study conducted in West Africa, of all participants (816 MSM), 24.3% had at least one STI symptom during the 4 follow-up years, and the overall STI symptoms incidence was 20.4 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.4–22.6). Between 2010 and 2017, overall diagnoses with gonorrhea/chlamydia increased by 76% across 46 European countries, and the increases were more pronounced for asymptomatic (142%) compared to symptomatic (31%) infections.

Trichomoniasis — management of sex partners: Concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for preventing reinfections, and current partners should be referred for presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated and any symptoms have resolved. Expedited partner therapy (EPT) might have a role and can be used in states where permissible by law; however, no partner management intervention has been demonstrated to be superior in reducing reinfection rates.

### Trichomoniasis in men and HIV infection: data from 2 outpatient clinics at lilongwe central hospital, Malawi [^b94cbf18]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the epidemiologic profile of trichomoniasis in men and its relationship to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Among men presenting for care for symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Malawi, trichomoniasis is not considered for first-line treatment.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1187 men attending either a dermatology or STI outpatient clinic in the capital of Malawi. Men were interviewed, and the etiologies of the STIs were determined.

Results

At the STI clinic (n = 756 men), we identified 150 men (20%) with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, 358 men (47%) with HIV infection, and 335 men (44%) with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. At the dermatology clinic (n = 431 men), we identified 54 (13%), 118 (27%), and 2 (0.5%) men, respectively. At both clinics, a lower education level and reporting never having used a condom were predictive of T. vaginalis infection. Only at the dermatology clinic was older age associated with infection, and only at the STI clinic were marital, genital ulcer disease, and HIV-infection status associated with T. vaginalis infection. At the STI clinic, urethral symptoms attributable to trichomoniasis were more severe among HIV-positive men than among HIV-negative men.

Conclusions

Given its high prevalence and the increased risk for HIV transmission, T. vaginalis infection should be reconsidered for inclusion in the Malawi STI-treatment regimen for men.

Composition of Lifetime Discounted QALYs Lost

Among men the main contributor to the total QALYs lost was urethritis, which contributed 74% (95% UI, 25%–99%) of QALYs lost for chlamydia, 85% (95% UI, 44%–99%) for gonorrhea, and 92% (95% UI, 22%–100%) for trichomoniasis (Figure 6). Symptomatic urethral infections were more common for gonorrhea than for chlamydia (Table 1).

Figure 6.
Decomposition of total discounted lifetime QALYs lost by infections and sequelae of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis by sex in the United States in 2018. The QALYs lost decomposed in this figure are the discounted lifetime QALYs lost per infection reported in Figure 3. The first bar for each of the 3 STIs for women represents the QALYs lost from the symptomatic infection itself. Bars 2 through 5 represent the QALYs lost due to each sequela (arising from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection), and the sum of the proportions of QALYs lost from infection and sequelae for each infection is 100%. Means are indentified as historgrams and 95% UIs are indentified as error bars. Abbreviations: CPP, chronic pelvic pain; CT, chlamydia; EDS, epididymitis; EP, ectopic pregnancy; GC, gonorrhea; PID, pelvic inflammatory disease; TFI, tubal factor infertility; TV, trichomoniasis; UTS, urethritis.

QALYs lost were higher in women than in men for all 3 STIs and across all age groups. The duration of chronic sequelae in women was estimated to be substantially longer than the duration of sequelae in men. For chlamydia in women, the composition of total QALYs lost was estimated to be 75% (95% UI, 48%–91%) due to CPP and 20% (95% UI, 6%–40%) due to TFI (Figure 6). The composition of total QALYs lost among women with gonorrhea was similar to that for chlamydia (Figure 6). The composition of total QALYs lost among women with trichomoniasis was estimated to be 78% (95% UI, 1%–100%) from symptomatic trichomoniasis and 17% (95% UI, 0%–83%) from CPP, primarily due to the assumed lower risk of PID for trichomoniasis. We report QALYs lost per case of PID in Supplementary Table 13.

HIV Infection

BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection. Women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral STI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States. Because trichomoniasis is not a reportable disease, and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and clinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based T. vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among males, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) and Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%). Unlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T. vaginalis prevalence rates are as high among women aged > 24 years as they are for women aged < 24 years. Among persons attending nine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas prevalence was 14.6% among women, and a study of STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified a prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men. Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%). Rates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3.2%–8% of incarcerated men. Women with a history of incarceration are two to five times more likely to have T. vaginalis. Other risk factors for T. vaginalis include having two or more sex partners during the previous year, having less than a high school education, and living below the national poverty level. Women with BV are at higher risk for T. vaginalis. Male partners of women with trichomoniasis are likely to have infection, although the prevalence of trichomoniasis among MSM is low.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^17a0c880]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — assessment, condom counseling and provision, presumptive treatment, and scope — are detailed as follows: Assessment of behavioral and biologic risk factors is recommended at initial and subsequent visits in clinical settings providing continuing care, and in clinical or nonclinical settings that provide one-time or episodic STD services, assessment is recommended at initial encounter and when clients seek follow-up services; recalling clients specifically for risk assessment may not be feasible. In this section, the term "assess" means eliciting information about behavioral and biologic risk factors for HIV transmission, including history of STD and STD symptoms, and the term "screen" means testing for STD pathogens in persons without symptoms. This section does not address screening persons with HIV for other conditions that have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis and human papillomavirus infection. All source guidance advises providing information or counseling about condom use; guidance from the Health Resources and Services Administration advises providing condoms to patients in publicly funded clinics. According to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, immediate presumptive treatment (or immediate linkage to such treatment) is recommended for persons who report sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or have STD syndromes in order to reduce the risk of onward STD transmission; STD syndromes are conditions that can be caused by sexually transmitted pathogens and cause symptoms or abnormal findings (signs) on physical examination, such as genital ulcer disease, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and proctitis. The cited source guidance describes the rationale for retesting for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection; the Evidence topic describes the rationale for retesting for trichomoniasis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections: a review [^6d4d897d]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 2018. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes.

Observations

From 2015 to 2019, the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis increased in the US; from 1999 to 2016, while the rates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 declined. Populations with higher rates of STIs include people younger than 25 years, sexual and gender minorities such as men and transgender women who have sex with men, and racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx people. Approximately 70% of infections with HSV and trichomoniasis and 53% to 100% of extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are asymptomatic or associated with few symptoms. STIs are associated with HIV acquisition and transmission and are the leading cause of tubal factor infertility in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests have high sensitivities (86.1%-100%) and specificities (97.1%-100%) for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, M genitalium, trichomoniasis, and symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2. Serology remains the recommended method to diagnose syphilis, typically using sequential testing to detect treponemal and nontreponemal (antiphospholipid) antibodies. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole, are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, M genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral treatment options for gonorrhea and M genitalium. No cure is available for genital herpes. Effective STI prevention interventions include screening, contact tracing of sexual partners, and promoting effective barrier contraception.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had an STI in 2018. Rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in the US have increased, while rates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have declined. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral therapies for gonorrhea and Mycoplasma genitalium, and no cure is available for genital herpes.

METHODS

Analytic Overview

We used probability-tree models to represent clinical outcomes of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis among men and women. We estimated health losses associated with the health outcomes along each distinct path of the probability tree and aggregated these into the total numbers of expected discounted lifetime QALYs lost per incident infection. Together with incidence estimates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in 2018 we estimated the overall population-level discounted lifetime QALYs lost by age and sex. Model inputs and parameter values were derived from a variety of sources (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 7). We conducted multivariate sensitivity analyses accounting for uncertainties in input parameters. All analyses were undertaken in R version 3.5.2.

Recommendations — sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services at follow-up HIV care visits provide all persons with HIV the following services: review of sexual, alcohol, and substance use histories since last visit to determine if behavioral risk-reduction interventions are warranted; review of STD symptoms since last visit and recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment to determine if STD testing, physical examination, or treatment is warranted; STD screening at least annually or more often if indicated by sexual risk behaviors; and review of sex partners who were not notified of possible HIV or STD exposure to determine if offering HIV partner services is warranted. For persons with a positive STD test; STD symptoms or signs; or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or experiencing STD symptoms, provide oral or injectable treatment onsite according to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines (including presumptive treatment [while awaiting STD test results] if indicated because of STD symptoms, or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment), advise to return 3 months after treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to obtain retesting for the relevant infection at the anatomic site of infection, advise persons diagnosed with syphilis to return for follow up serologic testing according to latest CDC recommendations, provide or refer to brief or intensive behavioral risk-reduction interventions, refer to voluntary HIV/STD partner services at health department or other trained partner services provider, and report cases of STD according to jurisdiction requirements and inform persons diagnosed with STD that case reporting may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential partner services in some jurisdictions.

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Follow-Up

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-onset premature ejaculation lasting for > 3 months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

Management of Sex Partners

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

Persistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis

The objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU should be made before considering additional antimicrobial therapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might be caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful treatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after treatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the value of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been demonstrated. Treatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has been estimated at 6%–12%. The most common cause of persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially after doxycycline therapy. Treatment failure for M. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men achieve clinical cure (i.e. resolution of symptoms) but can still have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens.

The initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance with treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex partner. If the patient did not comply with the treatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, retreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If therapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure occurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment regimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent or persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, chlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to guide further management decisions.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^71a2b899]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from 3 public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

Results

We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.0%-77.3%), of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

Conclusions

The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI, necessitating vastly improved partner management, application of sensitive nucleic-acid based testing, and better clinical recognition.

### Infection is uncommon in the British general population: implications for clinical testing and public health screening [^a382ef7b]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted protozoan, which adheres to mucous membranes of the vagina and male urethra to cause trichomoniasis. Globally, T. vaginalis is the single most prevalent non-viral STI. Indeed, the WHO estimated that more than 270 million cases occurred in 2008, greater than the combined total for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. However, T. vaginalis diagnosis is relatively rare in the UK, with around 6000 cases reported each year, compared with over 200 000 chlamydia cases.

National STI surveillance data in England show that over 90% of diagnosed T. vaginalis cases occur in women, a gender disparity attributed to more rapid spontaneous clearance of infection in men. Between 2009 and 2011, just under half of T. vaginalis diagnoses were in women of white ethnicity (in whom the rate was 10.7/100 000 population), but the rate of T. vaginalis diagnoses was much higher in black Caribbean women (329.6/100 000) and women of other black ethnicities (498.4/100 000), and much lower in men (33.9/100 000 in black Caribbean men and 0.6/100 000 in white men). However, diagnosis data are limited for a number of reasons, including that asymptomatic individuals may not seek healthcare, so the extent to which there might be a pool of undiagnosed infection in the wider population is unknown.

The BASHH 2014 guidelines recommend testing women according to clinical signs and symptoms, and men with persistent urethritis and/or who are contacts of individuals diagnosed with T. vaginalis. Widespread screening for T. vaginalis was previously limited because of a reliance on diagnostic assays, such as culture or wet mounts, which lack sensitivity and are time consuming. However, molecular assays with enhanced sensitivity are now readily available, either commercially or in-house, raising important questions about deployment of such tests for diagnostic and screening purposes.

The third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) is a probability sample survey, which included urine testing and reported history of diagnoses to estimate the prevalence for a range of STIs. Natsal-3 used molecular assays for T. vaginalis to enable description of the age-specific and gender-specific prevalence of T. vaginalis within the sexually active British general population to inform clinical practice and public health policy.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^90ecaaae]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts. This article describes advances in TV diagnostics which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of recurrent TV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis among male and female general populations in sub-saharan Africa from 2000 to 2024: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^338c6bec]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a substantial global health burden through acute urogenital conditions, complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility, and increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established targets to reduce STI incidence by 2030, which requires ambitious scale-up of national prevention and control programmes, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where STI prevalence is highest globally. However, monitoring and optimising these programmes is challenging due to high rates of asymptomatic infection, variable health-seeking behaviour, limited diagnostic capacity necessitating syndromic management, and weak surveillance systems.STI prevalence estimates are crucial for evaluating progress toward WHO targets but are hindered by infrequent population-representative studies, especially among men.

Estimates of curable STI prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. WHO publishes global and regional prevalence and incidence estimates for curable STIs, including chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis, CT), gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, NG), and trichomoniasis (Trichomonas vaginalis, TV), approximately every four years. These focus on global geographic regions and do not report sub-regional variation or temporal trends. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study generates global, regional, and national prevalence and incidence trends for several STIs. Both estimation approaches depend heavily on available data and underlying model assumptions. Due to limited data among men, WHO and GBD have derived male-to-female prevalence ratios from global data and applied these in most regions to support male prevalence estimates. Although WHO reviews its global ratios prior to each estimation round, values have not been updated since 1999 for trichomoniasis and 2005 for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Additionally, several systematic reviews have assessed the prevalence of curable STIs in sub-Saharan Africa among pregnant women, women participating in HIV prevention trials, or women living with HIV, but their generalisability beyond the specified populations is limited and these reviews have not examined changes in STI prevalence over time.

### Sexually transmitted infections: challenges ahead [^2dc065b2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

WHO estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritised five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control. Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence to support a shift from the current focus on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and of chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognised. We review current and potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder in women, but current treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence that suggests sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, which has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches. STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving STI control. Lastly, STIs in men who have sex with men have increased since the late 1990s. We discuss the contribution of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies and risk compensation. Overall, this Commission aims to enhance the understanding of some of the key challenges facing the field of STIs, and outlines new approaches to improve the clinical management of STIs and public health.

14.2 Trichomoniasis

The efficacy of a single 2-gram oral dose of SOLOSEC for the treatment of trichomoniasis was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, delayed treatment, double-blind, trial (Trial 5, NCT03935217). A total of 147 female patients from the United States aged 15 to 65 years were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either SOLOSEC or placebo. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all randomized patients who were culture positive for T. vaginalis and negative for other sexually transmitted infections. Of the 131 female patients in the mITT population, the median age was 36 years, and 90.8% were African American. Baseline clinical symptoms of vaginal itching, discharge, or odor were reported in 111 (84.7%) patients. Following initial dosing, the test of cure (TOC) visit occurred 6 to 12 days later. At the TOC visit, patients received the opposite treatment (placebo patients received SOLOSEC and vice versa) with a return visit 7 to 12 days later.

Results for microbiological cure, defined as testing negative for T. vaginalis, for the mITT population are presented in Table 5. The microbiological cure rate at the TOC visit was significantly higher in the SOLOSEC treatment group compared to the placebo group.

The single oral 2 g secnidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in males (one comparative study with metronidazole and ornidazole in males only1and three single-arm studies in males and females2,3,4). Parasitological evaluation was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 91.7% (165/180) to 100% (30/30) at time points ranging from 2 to 20 days (n = 437, 211 males and 226 females). In addition, the natural history of trichomoniasis in men was evaluated in one study.5The spontaneous resolution during a mean follow-up of 16 ± 12 days was noted in 36% (5/14) (95% CI: 12.8%, 64.9%) of untreated men.

### Noncandidal vaginitis: a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management [^98d8b6d5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is one of the most common causes of patient visits to gynecologists, primary care providers, and urgent care centers. However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.

### Are a speculum examination and wet mount always necessary for patients with vaginal symptoms? A pilot randomized controlled trial [^5e7a466c]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The suggested evaluation of vaginal symptoms is based on the wet mount diagnosis of candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis. We wondered if patients with vaginal symptoms could be managed initially based solely on symptoms.

Methods

This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 urban family practice clinics and enrolled 46 premenopausal, nonpregnant women with acute vaginal symptoms. In the control arm, women were managed based on a speculum examination and wet mount. In the intervention arm, women were managed based on symptoms. Women were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis and called 2 weeks later to assess symptom resolution, adverse medication effects, need for revisit, and satisfaction with care.

Results

Forty-one of 44 women (93%) felt better 2 weeks after the visit; 28 (64%) had complete resolution of symptoms. The intervention arm had slightly better resolution of symptoms (P = 0.046); there were other no differences between the 2 arms. Three women were diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases (trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea).

Conclusions

Our pilot study suggests that in selected women it may be reasonable to initially manage vaginal complaints based on symptoms. These results should be confirmed in other larger trials. Testing for sexually transmitted diseases is important in our population.

Other Sexually Transmitted Infections

YMSM and pregnant females should be routinely screened for syphilis (see Pregnant Women; Men Who Have Sex with Men). Local disease prevalence can help guide decision-making regarding screening for T. vaginalis, especially among adolescent females in certain areas. Routine screening of adolescents and young adults who are asymptomatic for certain STIs (e.g. syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV, HSV, HAV, and HBV) is not typically recommended.

Primary Prevention Recommendations

Primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for recognizing symptoms and behaviors associated with STIs are strategies that should be incorporated into all types of health care visits for adolescents and young adults. The following recommendations for primary prevention of STIs (i.e. vaccination and counseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for sexually active adolescents and young adults from federal agencies and medical professional organizations.

HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of 11 or 12 years.
The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents and young adults who have not previously received the universal HBV vaccine series during childhood.
The HAV vaccination series should be offered to adolescents and young adults as well as those who have not previously received the universal HAV vaccine series during childhood.
Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, and implications of infection should be regarded as an essential component of the anticipatory guidance provided to all adolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.
CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg and adults who are HIV negative and at substantial risk for HIV infection. YMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings with tailored adherence support (e.g. text messaging and visits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP, initial and follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing recommendations are the same for adolescents and adults.
Medical providers who care for adolescents and young adults should integrate sexuality education into clinical practice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents about the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for acquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding evidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a discussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction behaviors (e.g. consistent and correct condom use and reduction in the number of sex partners including concurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches (e.g. patient-centered counseling and motivational interviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention strategies and are recommended by USPSTF. Educational materials (e.g. handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can reinforce office-based educational efforts.

HIV Infection

Up to 53% of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection. T. vaginalis infection among these women is substantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Among women who are not virally suppressed, treatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in genital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding; however, no difference might occur among women who are virally suppressed. Because of the high prevalence of T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential for adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and possibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and prompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV infection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at least annually thereafter.

A randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV and T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. Factors that might interfere with standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among women with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV infection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired immunity. Thus, to improve cure rates, women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at the first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are recommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for vertical transmission of HIV.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV infection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

If a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the protocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). Other management considerations, follow-up, and management of sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV infection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow the same guidelines as for men without HIV.

For women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; NAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these tests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with trichomonas and HIV infection.

### The estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost due to Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States in 2018 [^02aa1223]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, there were 1 758 668 diagnoses of Chlamydia trachomatis infections and 583 405 diagnoses of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections reported in 2018, making chlamydia and gonorrhea the 2 most common notifiable infections in that year. Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis) is a common sexually transmitted protozoal infection. Trichomoniasis is not a notifiable disease in the United States, and over 80% of cases are estimated to be asymptomatic. In 2016, there were 222 000 initial physician office visits for trichomoniasis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), chronic pelvic pain (CPP), tubal factor infertility (TFI), and ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women and epididymitis (EDS) in men. The risk of reproductive health outcomes following trichomoniasis is less understood, but it is associated with increased risk of PID. In addition, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis are associated with an increased risk of acquisition and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in observational studies.

Estimates of the quality of life impacts of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis are needed to quantify the long-term health burden of these 3 sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The estimates can be used to inform cost-effectiveness analyses of STI prevention interventions. For example, gonorrhea vaccines are under development, and estimating the health burden caused by the infection is necessary to quantify the potential benefits from a vaccine.

Use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) enables comparison across a wide range of conditions and outcomes. Although health state utility values and QALYs lost associated with complications such as PID and/or TFI attributable to chlamydia and gonorrhea infections have been estimated in several primary studies, comprehensive evaluations of QALYs lost associated with infections and downstream health consequences secondary to infections have not been documented, particularly for trichomoniasis, and for all 3 infections in men. We estimated the QALYs lost per incident infection with C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis, and quantify the population-level QALYs lost attributable to each of the 3 STIs in 2018 by sex and age group.

Recurrent trichomoniasis — evaluation and retesting: A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure, lack of adherence, or reinfection, and the origin of the repeat infection should be assessed because most recurrent infections likely result from reinfection; retesting can be considered with culture, the preferred test, and if NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before 3 weeks after treatment completion. For partners of persons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among whom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners might benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment.

### Clinical evaluation of the cepheid xpert TV assay for detection of trichomonas vaginalis with prospectively collected specimens from men and women [^53d62c03]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This multicenter study evaluated test performance in prospectively collected first-catch urine (UR) samples from both women and men, endocervical swab (ES) specimens, clinician-collected vaginal swab (CC-VS) specimens, and patient-collected vaginal swab (PC-VS) specimens in a clinical setting. The sites participating in this study were academic medical centers, STD clinics, family planning clinics, public health departments, and clinical trial offices. The sites were located across the United States, including the West Coast, the Midwest, Southern states, and the East Coast. Subjects were eligible for enrollment regardless of the presence or absence of genital symptoms. Seventeen diverse geographic sites participated in collection of the specimens. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for each of the collection sites.

To be eligible for study enrollment, participants needed to be sexually active, ≥ 14 years of age, and provide informed consent and minor assent if needed. Subjects were excluded if they had been previously enrolled in the study, had received antimicrobial therapy within 21 days prior to enrollment, had undergone a hysterectomy, or had urinated less than 1 h prior to specimen collection. Female study participants were classified as symptomatic if they reported any of the following symptoms: itching, burning, redness, soreness, or irritation of the genitals, unusual odor, abnormal vaginal discharge, coital pain, and/or dysuria. Males were classified as symptomatic if they reported any of the following signs and/or symptoms: urethral discharge, dysuria, or urethral itching or burning, burning after ejaculation, and/or dysuria. Study participants not reporting any of the above symptoms were classified as asymptomatic.

### Epidemiology and laboratory characteristics of trichomonas vaginalis infection in Croatian men with and without urethritis syndrome: a case-control study [^52d9aa3f]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of trichomoniasis in men with and without symptoms of urethritis, with concomitant analysis of sociodemographic and behavioural specificities of both groups. Also, the objective is to evaluate laboratory methods used in the diagnostics of this parasitic disease.

Methods

A total of 500 men with and 200 without urethritis symptoms were included in the study. Every respondent filled out a questionnaire asking for some general data, specific information about habits, sexual behaviour and symptoms. Sediment of first void urine was analysed by wet mount microscopy, cultivation in Diamond's medium and real-time PCR.

Results

In the symptomatic group, Trichomonas vaginalis infection was documented in 2.4% of respondents by wet mount microscopy, in 4.8% by cultivation and in 8.2% by real-time PCR. In the asymptomatic group, infection was proven using the same methods in 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% of the respondents, respectively. Trichomoniasis prevalence was statistically significantly higher in the respondents manifesting urethritis symptoms when cultivation (χ2 = 4.20, p = 0.041) and real-time PCR (χ2 = 9.20, p = 0.002) were used. Several epidemiological risk factors were identified, and greater sensitivity of real-time PCR was found in comparison with microscopy and culture.

Conclusions

Trichomonas infection was statistically more frequent in men with urethritis syndrome. Assuming that the samples found positive by any laboratory technique are truly positive, it can be concluded that the real-time PCR showed the greatest sensitivity of all the methods used in this study.

### A cross-sectional analysis ofinfection among heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant African couples [^709bb3cb]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent curable STI worldwide and has been associated with adverse health outcomes and increased HIV-1 transmission risk. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among couples to assess how characteristics of both individuals in sexual partnerships are associated with the prevalence of male and female T. vaginalis infection.

Methods

African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples were concurrently tested for trichomoniasis at enrolment into two clinical trials. T. vaginalis testing was by nucleic acid amplification or culture methods. Using Poisson regression with robust standard errors, we identified characteristics associated with trichomoniasis.

Results

Among 7531 couples tested for trichomoniasis, 981 (13%) couples contained at least one infected partner. The prevalence was 11% (n = 857) among women and 4% (n = 319) among men, and most infected individuals did not experience signs or symptoms of T. vaginalis. Exploring concordance of T. vaginalis status within sexual partnerships, we observed that 61% (195/319) of T. vaginalis -positive men and 23% (195/857) of T. vaginalis -positive women had a concurrently infected partner. In multivariable analysis, having a T. vaginalis -positive partner was the strongest predictor of infection for women (relative risk (RR) 4.70, 95% CI 4.10 to 5.38) and men (RR 10.09, 95% CI 7.92 to 12.85). For women, having outside sex partners, gonorrhoea, and intermediate or high Nugent scores for bacterial vaginosis were associated with increased risk of trichomoniasis, whereas age 45years and above, being married, having children and injectable contraceptive use were associated with reduced trichomoniasis risk. Additionally, women whose male partners were circumcised, had more education or earned income had lower risk of trichomoniasis.

Conclusions

We found that within African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was high among partners of T. vaginalis -infected individuals, suggesting that partner services could play an important role identifying additional cases and preventing reinfection. Our results also suggest that male circumcision may reduce the risk of male-to-female T. vaginalis transmission.

### The detection of urethritis pathogens among patients with the male urethritis syndrome, genital ulcer syndrome and HIV voluntary counselling and testing clients: should south Africa's syndromic management approach be revised? [^8b5ec809]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of urethritis pathogens amongst male symptomatic urethritis (MUS) patients, genital ulcer (GUS) patients without urethritis symptoms and men requesting HIV testing at a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clinic.

Methods

A prospective study was conducted in Johannesburg, South Africa. Men from the three groups were screened for urethritis pathogens using molecular tests. Culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and, initially, trichomoniasis was performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was undertaken for ciprofloxacin on all gonococcal isolates; ciprofloxacin resistant isolates were screened for ceftriaxone resistance.

Results

664 participants were recruited (438 MUS, 76 GUS and 158 VCT) over 2 years. Gonorrhoea was detected in 62.3% MUS, 15.8% GUS and 3.2% VCT participants. Chlamydial infection was detected in 19.3% MUS, 13.2% GUS and 8.2% VCT participants. Trichomoniasis was detected in 4.9% MUS, 19.7% GUS and 3.8% VCT participants. Mycoplasma genitalium infection was detected in 14.4% MUS, 13.2% GUS and 7.0% VCT participants. Ciprofloxacin resistance increased from 13.0% in the first year to 26.3% in the second year; all resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

Urethritis pathogens, including Trichomonas vaginalis, should be covered in syndromic management treatment of genital ulcers in the absence of clinical urethritis. Consideration should be given to adding metronidazole to existing MUS treatment. Ciprofloxacin can no longer be relied upon to treat presumptive gonococcal infections in South Africa.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics.

A total of 2,064 subjects were evaluable for, including 984 men and 1,080 women (Table 1). Twenty-six samples were excluded fromanalyses for invalid results, protocol deviation, or insufficient sample volume: 3 female urine, 1 clinician-collected vaginal swab sample, 1 self-collected vaginal swab sample, 6 PreservCyt samples, 6 endocervical swab samples, 1 male urine sample, 2 male clinician-collected samples, 2 male self-collected samples, 1 vaginal swab without collection method information (self or clinician) and 3 meatal swabs without collection method information (self or clinician). Of the women in the final analysis, 542 were included in the clinician-collected and 535 were included in the self-collected arm of the study, with 1,074 women providing valid samples for PreservCyt and endocervical swab analysis and 1,077 women providing valid urine samples. Of the men, 488 were included in the clinician-collected meatal arm and 489 were included in the self-collected meatal arm of the study. A total of 983 men provided valid urine samples for analysis. Positivity forin this study, based on the PIS, was 15.8% (171/1,080) among all women, and 2.3% (23/983) among all men evaluated (Table 2). The prevalence ofin asymptomatic and symptomatic women was 12.1% (55/455) and 18.6% (11/625), respectively. The prevalence ofin asymptomatic and symptomatic men was 1.5% (10/668) and 4.1% (13/315), respectively.

### Update of trichomoniasis [^0aba9041]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis remains an extremely common infection despite the fact that rates of other treatable sexually transmitted diseases are declining. Newer diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are documenting higher rates of infection in heterosexual men than have been previously found with culture. Although data on the association of vaginal trichomoniasis with preterm birth are controversial, the association of trichomoniasis with HIV acquisition seems clear. Despite being a readily diagnosed and treated STD, trichomoniasis is not a reportable infection and control of the infection has received relatively little emphasis from public health STD control programmes. More recently, however, appreciation of high rates of disease and of associations of trichomoniasis in women with adverse outcomes of pregnancy and increased risk for HIV infection suggest a need for increased control efforts.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^8eb6792a]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### The estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost due to Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States in 2018 [^c8ef1c1f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Comprehensive evaluation of the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost attributable to chlamydia, gonorrhea, andtrichomoniasis in the United States is lacking.

Methods

We adapted a previous probability-tree model to estimate the average number of lifetime QALYs lost due to genital chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, per incident infection and at the population level, by sex and age group. We conducted multivariate sensitivity analyses to address uncertainty around key parameter values.

Results

The estimated total discounted lifetime QALYs lost for men and women, respectively, due to infections acquired in 2018, were 1541 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 186–6358) and 111 872 (95% UI, 29 777–267 404) for chlamydia, 989 (95% UI, 127–3720) and 12 112 (95% UI, 2 410–33 895) for gonorrhea, and 386 (95% UI, 30–1851) and 4576 (95% UI, 13–30 355) for trichomoniasis. Total QALYs lost were highest among women aged 15–24 years with chlamydia. QALYs lost estimates were highly sensitive to disutilities (health losses) of infections and sequelae, and to duration of infections and chronic sequelae for chlamydia and gonorrhea in women.

Conclusions

The 3 sexually transmitted infections cause substantial health losses in the United States, particularly gonorrhea and chlamydia among women. The estimates of lifetime QALYs lost per infection help to prioritize prevention policies and inform cost-effectiveness analyses of sexually transmitted infection interventions.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^c8bd9178]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e. > 4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e. epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^dc0a202a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of SEC vs placebo for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Importantly, SEC was superior to placebo in patients with trichomoniasis and vaginal symptoms and in those with HIV and/or BV. Although prior studies have shown trichomoniasis is asymptomatic in 70%–85% of cases, patients can present with symptoms including yellow-to-green frothy vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, pruritus, irritation, and/or dysuria. Thus, single-dose SEC may be an effective option for symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis in women.

National guidelines have traditionally recommended a single, 2 g dose of oral MTZ or TDZ as the preferred treatment of trichomoniasis in women, with oral MTZ 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days as an alternative regimen. In 2010, results of a randomized, open-label trial of a single oral dose of MTZ 2 g vs the 7-day MTZ 500 mg BID regimen in women with HIV and trichomoniasis demonstrated microbiological cure rates of 83.2% vs 91.5%, 6–12 days after treatment. These results led to the CDC recommendation to use the multidose MTZ regimen for trichomoniasis in women with HIV. In 2018, similar results were reported from a randomized, open-label trial of single- vs multidose MTZ for trichomoniasis in women without HIV. Microbiological cure rates at TOC were 81.4% and 89.1% in the single- and multidose MTZ groups. Hence, the 2020 ACOG practice bulletin on vaginitis now recommends the multidose MTZ regimen as the preferred regimen for trichomoniasis in nonpregnant women. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are anticipated later this year.

### Diagnosis and management of trichomonas vaginalis: summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^1322d71c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are > 4 times more likely to be infected than persons of other races. Since publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men. Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at 3 months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at 1 month test of cure compared with women receiving single-dose therapy (2 g). The 2-g single-dose oral metronidazole regimen remains the preferred treatment in men.

### Predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of lower genital tract infection in women [^e9213ed6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that diagnostic approaches to lower genital tract infections are inaccurate and proposed this study to evaluate typical approaches.

Study Design

Clinical diagnoses were made with symptoms, direct observation, wet mount, vaginal pH, and amines in 598 women with genital complaints. Laboratory testing for N gonorrhoeae, yeast, T vaginalis, C trachomatis, and bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain.

Results

The most frequent symptoms were vaginal discharge (64%), change in discharge (53%), malodor (48%), and pruritus (32%). The infection rates were 46% bacterial vaginosis, 29% yeast, 12% trichomoniasis, 11% chlamydia or gonorrhea; 21% of the patients had no infection. The symptoms did not predict laboratory diagnosis. Clinical signs and symptoms with office-based tests and microscopy improved the accuracy of diagnoses. Amsel's clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was the most sensitive at 92%. The sensitivity of wet mount diagnosis of trichomoniasis was 62%, of yeast by microscopy was 22%, and of mucopus for the prediction of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia was 30%.

Conclusion

Symptoms alone should not be used to direct treatment in instances in which resources permit more complete evaluation with office-based testing that includes microscopy. Treatment failures or diagnostic uncertainty should prompt specific laboratory testing.

### Sexually transmitted infections [^4b83c4c5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a significant burden on public health in the United States. Primary prevention counseling with early diagnosis and treatment remain the best methods to decrease the incidence of STIs. Through significant public heath interventions, the incidence of gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and trichomoniasis is decreasing; however, the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis is increasing. Human papilloma virus remains the most common STI, but new vaccinations have the possibility of having a significant impact on this virus's disease potential. This review discusses the most common STIs in the United States, focusing on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Trichomonas infection rates in males presenting to the emergency department for sexually transmitted infections [^26661cb6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Overall prevalence is reported to be 3.1%, with rates approaching 12.9–14.4% in high-risk female populations. Although there is a plethora of data on TV in the female population, the corresponding data for the male population are limited.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the infection rate of TV in male patients seeking care for STIs in the emergency department (ED) and determine the symptoms associated with TV infection in male patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of male patients aged 13 years or older who presented to the ED for STI evaluation. Male patients included had nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) TV testing as part of standard STI evaluation.

Results

Of the 2137 male patients included, 95 (4.4%) were positive for TV. Male patients who tested positive were significantly older (mean age 38.9 years vs. 30.7 years for male patients who tested negative; p < 0.05). Black male patients were more likely than White male patients to be positive for TV (6.3% prevalence vs. 1.8%; p < 0.05). TV-positive male patients were more likely to have discharge, specifically clear penile discharge, on examination (p < 0.05), and were less likely to have testicular pain or testicular tenderness (p < 0.05). Higher rates of TV were seen in an urban (4.9%) compared with suburban ED (1.6%; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Rates of TV in male patients who receive STI testing in the ED are similar to rates published previously for female patients. We found higher rates among older and African-American male patients. TV among male patients is prevalent and testing should continue when evaluating for STIs.

### Late recurrence of resistant trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis: relapse or re-infection? [^71bec6ad]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between re-infection and relapse of trichomonas infections is often a difficult task in the clinical setting. The chronicity of trichomonas infections and the ongoing sexual activity are two confounding factors. We present a patient with recurrent resistant vaginal trichomoniasis shortly following a sexual contact with an untreated partner after a complete response to treatment with tinidazole for nine months. We hypothesise that re-infection occurred from the asymptomatic partner who was an untreated chronic carrier of resistant trichomonas in the urogenital tract.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urethritis in men [^0c74b851]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of urethritis in men typically include urethral discharge, penile itching or tingling, and dysuria. A diagnosis can be made if at least one of the following is present: discharge, a positive result on a leukocyte esterase test in first-void urine, or at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field in urine sediment. The primary pathogens associated with urethritis are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Racial disparities in the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections persist in the United States, with rates of gonorrhea 40 times higher in black adolescent males than in white adolescent males. Recent studies have focused on identifying causes of nongonococcal urethritis and developing testing for atypical organisms, such as Mycoplasma genitalium and Ureaplasma species. Less common pathogens identified in patients with urethritis include Trichomonas species, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus. History and examination findings can help distinguish urethritis from other urogenital syndromes, such as epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis. The goals of treatment include alleviating symptoms; preventing complications in the patient and his sexual partners; reducing the transmission of coinfections (particularly human immunodeficiency virus); identifying and treating the patient's contacts; and encouraging behavioral changes that will reduce the risk of recurrence. The combination of azithromycin or doxycycline plus ceftriaxone or cefixime is considered first-line empiric therapy in patients with urethritis. Expedited partner treatment, which involves giving patients prescriptions for partners who have not been examined by the physician, is advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has been approved in many states. There is an association between urethritis and an increased human immunodeficiency virus concentration in semen.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^137389e1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g. those aged < 25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

Follow-Up

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

### The estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost due to Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States in 2018 [^0e721527]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We quantified the discounted lifetime QALYs lost in the United States due to chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis acquired in 2018. On both a per-infection basis and in terms of total aggregate QALYs lost nationwide, chlamydia imposed the greatest burden, followed by gonorrhea, then trichomoniasis. Published estimates of the QALYs lost in the United States due to syphilis suggest that syphilis has a higher QALY lost per infection (0.09; 95% UI, 0.03–0.19) than the 3 STIs we examined, and that syphilis is the second only to chlamydia in terms of the aggregate QALYs lost nationwide (13 349; 95% UI, 5071–31 360).

We accounted for a wide spectrum of long-term sequelae caused by the infections. Our estimates of QALYs lost in women revealed the substantial burden of CPP, which has been described as a neglected reproductive health morbidity. While there has been research on acute PID and TFI for women with chlamydia and gonorrhea, our results suggest that CPP causes the most health losses among women, contributing more than 70% (74.5%; 95% UI, 45.1%–90.6%) of the total QALYs lost. This underscores the importance of accounting for CPP when considering the benefits of chlamydia and gonorrhea interventions for women, and the need for further research on the burden of CPP and potential strategies to reduce this burden.

### Symptom-based versus laboratory-based diagnosis of five sexually transmitted infections in female sex workers in iran [^8474522f]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Among 1337 Iranian adult female sex workers in 2015, we assessed the diagnostic value of 4 self-reported sexually transmitted infection (STIs) symptoms for detecting laboratory-confirmed gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis. While 37.7% reported vaginal discharge (VD), 25.9% reported pain or burning (P/B), 3.0% reported genital ulcers (GU), and 1.4% reported genital warts (GW), the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HPV was 0.4, 1.3, 6.0, 11.9, and 41.9%, respectively. The sensitivity of VD was 40.3% for detecting tricomoniasis, 37.5% for chlamydia, and 37.5% for gonorrhea. The sensitivity of P/B ranged from 12.5% for gonorrhea to 25.2% for trichomoniasis. The sensitivity of GU and GW was very low for 5 STIs. The sensitivity of all symptoms combined was also lower than 50%. Among asymptomatic participants, 41.2% tested positive for HPV, 11.8% for trichomoniasis, and less than 6.6% for other STIs. Symptom-based case management and surveillance of STIs can lead to misclassification of a large proportion of cases.

### Interventions for treating trichomoniasis in women [^37e7af53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Around 120 million women worldwide suffer from Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis every year. The infection is sexually transmitted and is believed to facilitate HIV transmission.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various treatment strategies for trichomoniasis in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Trials were also identified from reference lists of reviews, through pharmaceutical companies, and by informal discovery. Only published data were used in this review. Date of the most recent search: November, 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of different treatment strategies in women with trichomoniasis. Different antitrichomonal drugs or doses were eligible, as were comparisons of treatment with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data extracted by two reviewers independently using standard criteria.

Main Results

Fifty-four trials were included. Nitroimidazole drugs seem to be effective in achieving parasitological cure in short term follow up. Partner treatment can be effective in decreasing longer term reinfection rates.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Parasitological cure can be achieved by single oral dose of nitroimidazole. Further research should focus on developing effective partner treatment strategies to prevent reinfections and reduce trichomoniasis prevalence.

Data extraction

Researchers (JM, LH, RLA, QH) independently double-extracted prevalence observations (number of individuals with a positive result of the total number tested) for each study with stratification by country, sex, and population group, as available. We also recorded information on study characteristics, participant characteristics, and diagnostic methodology (Supplementary Table S3). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus.

If outcomes from the same study were reported in multiple articles, we preferentially extracted observations from the largest sample or, if samples were the same size, the first published article. For studies collecting samples from multiple anatomical sites, we extracted only urogenital results. If multiple diagnostic tests were conducted, we extracted outcomes from the test and sample type with highest sensitivity and specificity for pathogen identification (Supplementary Table S4). We preferentially extracted non-stratified rather than HIV-stratified outcomes, if both were reported.

### Global epidemiology of trichomonas vaginalis [^b93a726f]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Despite having the highest prevalence of any sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally, there is a dearth of data describing Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) incidence and prevalence in the general population. The lack of basic epidemiological data is an obstacle to addressing the epidemic. Once considered a nuisance infection, the morbidities associated with TV have been increasingly recognised over the past decade, highlighting the importance of this pathogen as a public health problem. Recent developments in TV diagnostics and molecular biology have improved our understanding of TV epidemiology. Improved characterisation of the natural history of TV infection has allowed us to hypothesise possible explanations for observed variations in TV prevalence with age. Direct and indirect hormonal effects on the female genital tract provide a likely explanation for the greater burden of persistent TV infection among women compared with men. Further characterisation of the global epidemiology of TV could enhance our ability to respond to the TV epidemic.

STI screening of persons with HIV infection in HIV care settings — at the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all sexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, and perform screening for these infections at least annually during the course of HIV care; specific testing includes syphilis serology and NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure. Women should also be screened for trichomoniasis at the initial visit and annually thereafter, and women should be screened for cervical cancer precursor lesions per existing guidelines. More frequent screening for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (e.g., every 3 or 6 months) should be tailored to individual risk and the local prevalence of specific STIs, and certain STIs can be asymptomatic such that their diagnosis might prompt referral for partner services, identification of sexual and needle-sharing partners for early diagnosis and treatment of HIV, and reengagement in care or HIV prevention services (e.g. PEP or PrEP).

How these recommendations differ from previous recommendations — updated recommendations advise screening for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection in genital and extra-genital sites using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), screening for trichomoniasis with more sensitive tests: NAAT or culture, informing persons with HIV that reporting of specified infections by laboratories and health care providers as required by state laws may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential HIV partner services in some jurisdictions, retesting persons diagnosed with gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis 3 months after treatment, and using the STD treatment regimens most recently recommended by CDC that include administration of two different antimicrobial drugs for gonorrhea, one of which requires injection.

### High rates of trichomonas vaginalis among men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic: implications for screening and urethritis management [^e8689ad3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Trichomonas is a cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); however, studies of its prevalence in men have been hampered by the lack of sensitive diagnostics. DNA amplification allows for reappraisal of the extent of infection in men. Men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic were tested for trichomonas, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The prevalence of these pathogens was 17%, 19.6%, and 17.7% respectively. In men with NGU, 19.9% were infected with trichomonas. These data have implications for treatment of NGU and control of trichomoniasis.

Evaluation of STD-Related Conditions

Genital ulcer disease can be caused by syphilis, HSV, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The more common sexually transmitted causes of male urethritis syndrome can include gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, trichomoniasis, and HSV. Diseases characterized by vaginal discharge as a result of vaginitis can include bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis. The causes of epididymitis, pharyngitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can include gonorrhea and chlamydia. Most genital warts are caused by nononcogenic HPV types. However, on occasion, oncogenic types can be found in genital warts. Proctitis can be caused by gonorrhea, LGV serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis, and HSV. Ectoparasitic infections typically include pediculosis pubis and scabies. Systemic or dermatologic conditions compatible with or suggestive of an STD can include disseminated gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, condylomata lata, or palmar plantar syphilitic rash. STD-related conditions warrant prompt evaluation of signs and symptoms to make an accurate diagnosis and provide timely empiric treatment to prevent complications and onward transmission. Patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of an STD etiology (genital ulcer disease, urethritis, vaginal discharge, PID, epididymitis, pharyngitis, genital warts, proctitis, ectoparasitic infections, or certain systemic or dermatologic conditions) should be evaluated.

Recommendations for the STD-related conditions that should be evaluated are summarized (Box 5). Additional information on these recommendations is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

Evaluation of sexually transmitted disease–related conditions recommendations in primary care and sexually transmitted diseases specialty care settings*

Abbreviations: PID = pelvic inflammatory disease; STD = sexually transmitted disease.

* Primary care setting is defined as a place where patients are evaluated for various health conditions. STD specialty care setting is defined as a place where the focus is on providing patients with timely, comprehensive, confidential, and culturally sensitive STD care. STD care delivered in STD specialty care settings includes all care delivered in primary care settings.

† Evaluation for proctitis might include visual examination of the anus, anorectal examination with a rectal swab, digital anorectal exam, or anoscopy. For specialized STD care, high-resolution anoscopy might be included.

Vaginal symptoms — office-based evaluation and microscopy — can often be assessed by pH, potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing, and microscopic examination of a wet mount; an elevated pH (i.e., > 4.5) is common with bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis, but because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. On saline preparation, motile trichomonads or clue cells may be seen, and the KOH specimen is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis; however, absence of these organisms does not rule out infection because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without trichomonads or yeast might indicate cervicitis, and for women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2006 [^8fdc2935]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, during April 19–21, 2005. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2002 (MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-6]). Included in these updated guidelines are an expanded diagnostic evaluation for cervicitis and trichomoniasis; new antimicrobial recommendations for trichomoniasis; additional data on the clinical efficacy of azithromycin for chlamydial infections in pregnancy; discussion of the role of Mycoplasma genitalium and trichomoniasis in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum protocolitis among men who have sex with men (MSM); expanded discussion of the criteria for spinal fluid examination to evaluate for neurosyphilis; the emergence of azithromycin- resistant Treponema pallidum; increasing prevalence of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM; revised discussion concerning the sexual transmission of hepatitis C; postexposure prophylaxis after sexual assault; and an expanded discussion of STD prevention approaches.

### Prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis among male and female general populations in sub-saharan Africa from 2000 to 2024: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^2c901f46]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence globally, but information about trends and geographic variation is limited by sparse aetiologic studies, particularly among men. This systematic review assessed chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis prevalence by sex, sub-region, and year, and estimated male-to-female prevalence ratios in SSA.

Methods

We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Global Health, PubMed, and African Index Medicus for studies measuring STI prevalence among general populations from 1 January 2000, to 17 September 2024. We adjusted observations for diagnostic test performance and used log-binomial mixed-effects meta-regressions to estimate prevalence trends and sex-prevalence ratios. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023420384).

Findings

Of 5202 records identified, we included 211 studies from 28 countries. In 2020, estimated prevalence among 15-49-year-olds in SSA for chlamydia was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2–8.7%, n = 169 observations) among females and 4.2% (3.0–5.5%, n = 33) among males, gonorrhoea was 1.8% (1.1–2.5%, n = 171) and 1.5% (0.8–2.2%, n = 31), and trichomoniasis was 7.6% (5.1–10.2%, n = 188) and 1.7% (1.1–2.4%, n = 19). Male-to-female ratios were 0.61 (0.53–0.71) for chlamydia, 0.81 (0.61–1.09) for gonorrhoea, and 0.23 (0.18–0.28) for trichomoniasis. From 2010 to 2020, chlamydia prevalence increased by 34.5% (11.1–62.9%) in SSA, while gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis trends were not statistically significant. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea prevalence were highest in Southern and Eastern Africa, whereas trichomoniasis was similar across sub-regions.

Interpretation

SSA has a high, geographically varied STI burden, with increasing prevalence of chlamydia. Region-specific sex-prevalence ratios differed from existing global ratios and should be considered in future burden estimates. Enhanced sex-stratified surveillance is crucial to guide national programmes and reduce STI prevalence in SSA.

### The estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost due to Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in the United States in 2018 [^9bbd38bb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Population-Level Discounted QALYs Lost

The population-level discounted lifetime QALYs lost for all the 3 STIs acquired in 2018 was 131 477 (95% UI, 34 325–324 487), with 128 561 (95% UI, 33 177–315 663) among women and 2916 (95% UI, 380–11 504) among men. The population-level discounted lifetime QALYs lost for infections acquired in 2018 were 1541 (95% UI, 186–6358) due to chlamydia among men aged 15–39 years, 989 (95% UI, 127–3720) due to gonorrhea among men aged 15–39 years, and 386 (95% UI, 30–1851) due to trichomoniasis among men aged 15–59 years (Supplementary Table 9). The population-level discounted lifetime QALYs lost by age groups analyzed were highest for chlamydia among men aged 15–24 and 25–39 years, followed by gonorrhea among men aged 25–39 years (Figure 4), primarily driven by patterns of incidence across infections and ages (highest for chlamydia in men aged 15–24 years) (Supplementary Table 5), and a larger number of QALYs lost per incident infection for gonorrhea compared to chlamydia or trichomoniasis for men (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 8).
