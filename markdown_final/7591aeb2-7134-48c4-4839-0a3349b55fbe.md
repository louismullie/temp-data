## Question

Petichiae on ble with cardiovascular disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about petechiae in the context of cardiovascular disease, including mechanisms, differentials, evaluation, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining petechiae and their pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize cardiovascular contexts where petechiae occur, including anticoagulation, infective endocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and vasculitis. Next, I will outline a prioritized differential diagnosis and a practical diagnostic approach. After that, I need to consider management strategies tailored to the underlying cause, including when to reverse anticoagulation, treat thrombocytopenia, or manage vasculitis. Finally, I should review special scenarios and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway with risk stratification and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: petechiae are pinpoint, nonblanching hemorrhages into the skin or mucosa due to extravasation of erythrocytes, typically reflecting platelet dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, or vascular injury, and they are a classic cutaneous sign of bleeding diathesis that warrants systematic evaluation rather than dismissal as benign bruising [^5656e42d] [^e0ca6aa5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to categorize the cardiovascular contexts in which petechiae commonly appear. The most frequent is anticoagulant-related bleeding, where warfarin, DOACs, or antiplatelet agents increase bleeding risk and petechiae are an early cutaneous signal of excessive anticoagulation, with major bleeding risks rising when combined with other agents or in older adults, and FDA labeling explicitly lists petechiae as a manifestation of over-anticoagulation with warfarin and highlights bleeding risks with DOACs and antiplatelets [^c8cd34d3] [^55ee9478] [^3fe7441f] [^a84b21db] [^068f2815].

> Wait, let me verify the second major context: infective endocarditis. Petechiae, along with splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, and Osler nodes, are classic extracardiac stigmata that should trigger echocardiography and blood cultures; I initially thought Janeway lesions were just petechiae, but I should correct that — Janeway lesions are painless, hemorrhagic macules on the palms and soles, whereas petechiae are smaller and more diffuse, and both can coexist in endocarditis, so I need to keep the full constellation in mind during exam and documentation [^241fa728] [^772aab14] [^c77effee].

> I will now examine thrombocytopenia-related etiologies, because cardiovascular patients may have drug-induced or disease-related low platelets. Immune thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can all present with petechiae and carry different management implications; I should confirm platelet counts, smear, and, when indicated, HIT antibodies or ADAMTS13 activity to distinguish these entities and avoid harmful interventions like platelet transfusion in HIT or TTP [^c9475176] [^493d0365] [^5aa22a70].

> But wait, what if the petechiae reflect vasculitis rather than a platelet disorder? Leukocytoclastic vasculitis and drug-induced vasculitis can present with palpable purpura and petechiae, and anticoagulants like dabigatran have been implicated in case reports; I should consider medication timing, distribution, and biopsy if the diagnosis is uncertain, especially when systemic features or atypical distributions are present [^9374b327] [^5656e42d].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis in a prioritized way so I don't miss time-sensitive conditions. High-priority causes include anticoagulant excess, infective endocarditis, severe thrombocytopenia including HIT and TTP, and sepsis with DIC; moderate-priority considerations include vasculitis, acquired von Willebrand syndrome in high platelet states, and malignancy-related cytopenias; lower-priority but still relevant causes include vascular fragility from Cushing's, scurvy, or amyloidosis, and I should tailor the workup to the patient's risk profile and acuity [^5656e42d] [^c9475176] [^5aa22a70] [^5dc4e95c].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach and make sure I sequence it correctly. I should start with a careful history of antithrombotic use, dosing, and adherence, recent procedures, infections, and systemic symptoms, then a focused exam for distribution of petechiae and other stigmata such as oral mucosal bleeding, splinter hemorrhages, and neurologic deficits; concurrently, I should obtain CBC with platelet count and smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and renal and hepatic panels, adding HIT antibodies, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and LDH if TTP/DIC/HIT is suspected, and proceed to echocardiography and cultures if endocarditis is on the table [^c77effee] [^c9475176] [^e0ca6aa5].

> I should double-check management principles for anticoagulant-related petechiae. For warfarin, reversal depends on INR and bleeding severity, with vitamin K for INR elevation with bleeding and PCC or FFP for life-threatening hemorrhage; for DOACs, supportive measures and specific reversal agents such as andexanet alfa or idarucizumab are indicated for major bleeding; for minor cutaneous bleeding, holding or reducing the anticoagulant dose and correcting modifiable risks may suffice, and I need to balance thrombotic risk against bleeding in shared decision-making rather than reflexively stopping therapy [^c8cd34d3] [^55ee9478] [^3fe7441f] [^ef3c7222].

> For suspected endocarditis, I need to ensure prompt empiric antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures and arrange transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography to assess for vegetations; I should also document any embolic phenomena and coordinate surgical evaluation if indicated, because delays worsen outcomes and petechiae may be the earliest clue in some patients [^772aab14] [^241fa728].

> If thrombocytopenia is the driver, I should confirm the subtype before treating. For ITP, corticosteroids or IVIG are first-line; for HIT, I must stop all heparin and start a non-heparin anticoagulant at therapeutic intensity once platelets recover; for TTP, urgent plasma exchange is lifesaving; and I should avoid platelet transfusion in HIT and TTP unless there is life-threatening bleeding, given the risk of thrombosis or worsening microthrombi [^c9475176] [^493d0365] [^5aa22a70] [^a691eb7b].

> For vasculitis, I need to check for systemic involvement and consider biopsy to confirm leukocytoclastic vasculitis; management hinges on removing the offending drug when applicable and initiating immunosuppression such as corticosteroids, with escalation based on severity and organ involvement, and I should remember that anticoagulants can rarely precipitate drug-induced vasculitis, which changes management strategy [^9374b327] [^5656e42d].

> Let me consider special scenarios so I don't overlook important nuances. In patients with mechanical heart valves or recent stenting, abrupt cessation of anticoagulation risks catastrophic thrombosis, so I should prefer dose reduction, INR optimization, or bridging strategies rather than complete withdrawal when feasible; in older adults with frailty or falls, I should reassess the indication for anticoagulation and consider lower-intensity strategies or alternative therapies; and in cancer patients on BTK inhibitors, petechiae are common but major bleeding can occur, so I should coordinate with oncology and adjust therapy based on bleeding severity and thrombotic risk [^cae7c5d3] [^37c63fdb] [^7eae1ee2].

> I should confirm risk stratification tools and their limitations. HAS-BLED and ATRIA can identify modifiable bleeding risks but should not be used in isolation to deny indicated anticoagulation; instead, I should use them to mitigate risks such as uncontrolled hypertension, anemia, or concomitant NSAIDs, and to guide monitoring intensity and patient counseling about bleeding signs like petechiae [^cae7c5d3] [^00a05d3e].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and patient education are explicit. Patients should be taught to report new petechiae, bruising, mucosal bleeding, or neurologic symptoms promptly; those on warfarin need consistent INR monitoring and dietary stability; and those on DOACs should have periodic renal function checks and medication reconciliation to avoid interactions that increase bleeding risk, with a low threshold to reassess the antithrombotic regimen if bleeding stigmata recur [^c8cd34d3] [^ef3c7222].

> In summary, petechiae in cardiovascular patients most often reflect anticoagulant-related bleeding, but I must actively consider infective endocarditis, thrombocytopenia syndromes, and vasculitis; a structured history and exam plus targeted labs and imaging guide timely, cause-specific management, and I should always balance thrombotic benefit against bleeding risk rather than reactively stopping life-saving anticoagulation [^5656e42d] [^c77effee] [^cae7c5d3].

Petechiae in cardiovascular disease most often reflect **platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia** from antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy [^7eae1ee2], **vasculitis or embolic phenomena** in infective endocarditis [^241fa728], or **microvascular ischemia** in severe heart failure or shock [^notfound]. They are a red flag for bleeding risk and mandate prompt evaluation of **CBC, coagulation profile, and medication review** [^e0ca6aa5]. Management is cause-specific: reverse anticoagulation if indicated [^c8cd34d3], treat thrombocytopenia [^c9475176], address vasculitis or embolic sources [^notfound], and escalate supportive care in shock or DIC [^8b9e1c67]. Persistent or unexplained petechiae warrant hematology and cardiology input to guide therapy and mitigate complications [^9db40e0b].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** link petechiae to cardiovascular disease:

- **Platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia**: Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel) [^37de6e42] and anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, DOACs) [^c8cd34d3] can impair primary hemostasis, leading to petechiae. Thrombocytopenia from bone marrow suppression, immune destruction, or consumption (e.g. HIT, TTP, DIC) [^c9475176] also causes petechiae [^5aa22a70].

- **Vascular injury and inflammation**: Vasculitis (e.g. ANCA-associated) [^d220802e] and immune-mediated endothelial injury cause petechiae via vessel wall damage and extravasation of erythrocytes [^5656e42d].

- **Embolic phenomena**: Infective endocarditis emboli [^241fa728] cause microvascular occlusion and ischemia, leading to petechiae and other hemorrhagic lesions [^772aab14].

- **Microvascular ischemia and hypoperfusion**: Severe heart failure, shock, or DIC cause endothelial injury and extravasation, producing petechiae [^8b9e1c67].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

Petechiae in cardiovascular disease are clinically significant and often indicate **underlying pathology**:

- **Bleeding risk**: Petechiae signal increased bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy [^7eae1ee2], and may precede major hemorrhage [^notfound].

- **Diagnostic clue**: Petechiae can be an early sign of infective endocarditis, vasculitis, or thrombocytopenia, prompting targeted evaluation [^241fa728] [^5656e42d].

- **Prognostic indicator**: Petechiae in severe cardiovascular disease (e.g. shock, DIC) indicate poor prognosis and need for aggressive management [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic evaluation** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history (medications, bleeding history, systemic symptoms) [^6678c460] |
| 2 | Physical examination (distribution of petechiae, other bleeding signs) [^a68f1e12] |
| 3 | Laboratory tests (CBC, platelet count, coagulation profile, renal/liver function) [^e0ca6aa5] |
| 4 | Specialized tests (HIT antibodies, ADAMTS13, autoimmune panel, echocardiography) [^493d0365] [^5aa22a70] [^772aab14] |
| 5 | Skin biopsy (if vasculitis or embolic disease suspected) [^5656e42d] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Anticoagulant-related petechiae**: Adjust or discontinue anticoagulation based on bleeding severity and thrombotic risk [^c8cd34d3]; use reversal agents (vitamin K, PCC, andexanet alfa) for major bleeding [^c8cd34d3].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Treat the cause (e.g. steroids/IVIG for ITP [^notfound], plasma exchange for TTP [^notfound], alternative anticoagulation for HIT) [^828b6e63]; transfuse platelets only for severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding or high risk [^c9475176].

- **Vasculitis or embolic disease**: Immunosuppression for vasculitis [^notfound]; treat embolic sources (e.g. infective endocarditis) with antibiotics and consider surgery [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Address shock, DIC, or organ failure with ICU-level care, hemostatic support, and correction of coagulopathy [^8b9e1c67].

---

## Prognostic implications

Petechiae in cardiovascular disease carry **important prognostic implications**:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Higher likelihood of major hemorrhage, especially with anticoagulation [^7eae1ee2].

- **Severity marker**: Indicates advanced disease (e.g. shock, DIC, infective endocarditis) and worse outcomes [^notfound].

- **Need for vigilance**: Prompt recognition and management can reduce morbidity and mortality [^9db40e0b].

---

Petechiae in cardiovascular disease reflect platelet dysfunction, vascular injury, or embolic/ischemic processes and signal **increased bleeding risk** and underlying disease severity. A focused diagnostic workup and cause-specific management are essential to reduce complications and improve outcomes.

### Cardiovascular toxicities of BTK Inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic Leukemia: state-of-the-art review [^37c63fdb]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of BTK inhibitor-related bleeding

Although bleeding events are common adverse effects noted with BTK inhibitor therapy, the majority of these will not require treatment discontinuation. Minor events, including bruising and petechiae, do not suggest underlying hemorrhage, and therapy may be sustained without dose adjustments or discontinuation. Ibrutinib may be held in the case of noticeable or major bleeding events, although without hemodynamic consequence. Because bleeding appears to be primarily mediated through a platelet-inhibitory process, patients with major hemorrhage should be aggressively resuscitated with platelet transfusion, regardless of platelet count. Although not specifically studied in this population, some clinicians may also elect for the administration of tranexamic acid.BTK inhibitor therapy should be held indefinitely in the event of such a bleed, and discussion of ongoing usage should be a part of the discussion with the primary oncology team. Because the risk of major bleeding appears to increase with the use of both antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, it may be worth considering alternative anticancer-specific therapies in those with a very high risk of serious bleeding and need for long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. In our experience, it is reasonable in the perioperative period to hold BTK inhibitor therapy for 3 days with minor procedures or 7 days with major procedures both before and after a planned procedure, given the heightened bleeding risk with BTK inhibitor therapy. Nevertheless, the given risks and benefits of holding BTK inhibitor-treatment for some (less urgent) procedures should be discussed with the patient depending on their disease control and clinical status.

### Dabigatran-related leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^9374b327]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Dabigatran is a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant that has been approved for atrial fibrillation and prevention of venous thromboembolism. Its use has been increasing in the USA since serum drug levels do not need monitoring. To date, no significant skin side effects have been reported other than 4 cases of non-specific skin lesion and 2 cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), which is a small vessel inflammatory disease that presents as palpable purpura in lower extremities. We present a man aged 57 years with chronic deep vein thrombosis who developed palpable purpura, petechiae, swelling in lower extremities, torso and distal upper extremities on the third day after dabigatran initiation. The present case highlights the potential risk for LCV with dabigatran use and provides insight into its management.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) [^7eae1ee2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA. Major hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3, serious, or any central nervous system events; e.g., intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) occurred in 4.2% of patients, with fatalities occurring in 0.4% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade including bruising and petechiae occurred in 39%, and excluding bruising and petechiae occurred in 23% of patients who received IMBRUVICA, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.

Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage. Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage. The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4.4%, and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6.1%. Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2 Infections

Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21% of 1,476 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately.

### Coagulation disorders and their cutaneous presentations: diagnostic work-up and treatment [^1f0e17ad]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Both inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states can present with nonspecific clinical manifestations, such as petechiae, purpura, livedo reticularis, and ulcerations. A good history and physical examination are crucial to diagnoses of these conditions. Inherited conditions tend to present either in neonatal period or later in life, while acquired conditions typically occur later in life. Diagnostic studies are performed to identify the coagulation cascade deficiency or defect. Treatment primarily hinges on anticoagulation and wound care. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations, diagnostic considerations, and management options of patients in hypercoagulable states.

### Management of bleeding risk in patients who receive anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on predictive and diagnostic variables in thrombotic disease [^ef3c7222]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a common cardiovascular disease, affecting 1–2 per 1000 individuals per year worldwide. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulant treatment is critical as historical studies have reported mortality rates up to 30% when acute VTE is left untreated. To prevent thrombus progression and early recurrences once a diagnosis of VTE is established, anticoagulant treatment begins with an initiation phase that lasts for 5–21 days, depending on the anticoagulant regimen selected, and is continued for at least 3 months (i.e. the treatment phase). After completion of the treatment phase, the decision to continue anticoagulation is driven mainly by the estimated risk of recurrent VTE. Current guidelines advise to consider continuation of anticoagulant therapy among patients with major persistent risk factors (e.g. cancer or antiphospholipid syndrome) or when VTE occurs in the absence of transient risk factors (i.e. unprovoked VTE).

Although anticoagulant therapy is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, this comes at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of major bleeding is greatest during the initial 3 months of treatment with an estimated incidence of 2%, and a case fatality rate of 11.3%, comparable to the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE. For patients who receive anticoagulant drugs for more than 3 months, the reported risk of major bleeding is 1.3–2.2 per 100 patient‐years (reaching a 5‐year cumulative risk of 6.3%) with a case fatality rate of 5.1%–12% in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). This risk is considerably lower when patients are treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approximating 0.72–1.6 events/100 patient years, while evidence on cumulative risks beyond 24 months are still sparse. These numbers highlight the importance of harm‐to‐benefit assessment of long‐term anticoagulant treatment, for which the risk of VTE recurrence is weighed against the risk of bleeding. In addition, identification of potentially modifiable bleeding predictors may provide physicians tools to diminish an individual patient's bleeding risk during follow‐up.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^c8cd34d3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.

### Hemorrhagic transformation in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and an indication for anticoagulation [^17ee16f4]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can occur in patients following acute ischaemic stroke in the form of hemorrhagic transformation, and results in significant long-term morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulation theoretically increases risk. We evaluated stroke patients with an indication for anticoagulation to determine the factors associated with hemorrhagic transformation.

Methods

Three-hundred and forty-five patients with ICD-9 codes indicating: (i) acute ischaemic stroke; and (ii) an indication for anticoagulation were screened. One-hundred and twenty-three met inclusion criteria. Data were collected retrospectively. Neuroimaging was reviewed for infarct volume and evidence of ICH. Hemorrhages were classified as: hemorrhagic conversion (petechiae) versus intracerebral hematoma (a space occupying lesion); symptomatic versus asymptomatic. Using multivariable logistic regression, we determined the hypothesized factors associated with intracerebral bleeding.

Results

Age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.50 per 10-year increment, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–2.08], infarct volume (OR = 1.10 per 10ccs, 95% CI 1.06–1.18) and worsening category of renal impairment by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.04–3.66) were predictors of hemorrhagic transformation. Ninety- nine out of 123 patients were anticoagulated. Hemorrhage rates of patients on and off anticoagulation did not differ (25.3% vs. 20.8%; P = 0.79); however, all intracerebral hematomas (n = 7) and symptomatic bleeds (n = 8) occurred in the anticoagulated group.

Conclusions

The risk of hemorrhagic transformation in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and an indication for anticoagulation is multifactorial, and most closely associated with an individual's age, infarct volume and eGFR.

### Why is my patient bleeding or bruising? [^6678c460]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient presenting with bleeding symptoms is challenging. Bleeding symptoms are frequently reported by a normal population, and overlap significantly with bleeding disorders, such as type 1 Von Willebrand disease. The history is subjective; bleeding assessment tools significantly facilitate an accurate quantification of bleeding severity. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from defects in primary hemostasis, coagulation deficiencies, to connective tissue disorders. Finally, despite significant clinical evidence of abnormal bleeding, many patients will have not an identifiable disorder. Clinical management of bleeding disorders is highly individualized and focuses on the particular symptoms experienced by the patient.

6 CONCLUSION

Based on current evidence, we provide recommendations for the standardized management of bleeding risk in VTE patients during both the short‐ and long‐term follow‐up, and propose research priorities to improve our understanding and allow for solid guideline recommendations on this topic.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^c9475176]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 103 per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 103 per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 103 per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 103 per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 103 per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

### Hematologic emergencies: recognition and initial management [^9db40e0b]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematologic emergencies are bleeding or clotting disorders that are hereditary or acquired and must be treated emergently to avoid significant morbidity or mortality. Patients experiencing a hematologic emergency may present with spontaneous bleeding, jaundice, petechiae, or purpura. Initial diagnostic testing should include a complete blood count. Patients who have bleeding associated with a hereditary disorder should receive clotting factor replacement before diagnostic testing. Acute chest syndrome is an uncommon but serious complication of sickle cell disease. Hemolysis caused by autoimmune disorders or iatrogenic errors from blood product transfusions has a distinct clinical presentation and requires immediate action. Severe thrombocytopenia presenting as immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be differentiated and treated appropriately. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and trauma coagulopathy are sometimes confused with each other, but both can cause serious injury and require unique treatments. Primary care physicians should promptly recognize patients who require emergent referral to a hematologic specialist.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design, setting, and population

We included all patients older than 18 years of age referred with a suspected bleeding disorder to a specialized outpatient clinic of Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, between January 2012 and March 2017. Reasons for the referral were (a) a bleeding tendency, (b) a family history of bleeding disorders, or (c) abnormal laboratory test results. Inselspital Bern is a tertiary university hospital in Switzerland covering a region with 1.5 million inhabitants. The catchment area of the hospital is representative for Switzerland with regard to German‐speaking and French‐speaking residents, as well as patients living in either urban or rural areas. Inselspital University Hospital comprises the only specialized laboratory and its hematological outpatient clinic functions as a reference center for coagulation disorders.

Clinical data were prospectively recorded using an established in‐house questionnaire as well as the ISTH‐BAT sheet in the electronic hospital database. Laboratory data were stored accordingly. Patient files were coded using an in‐house identification system and data were retrieved by two investigators working in parallel (MA/JK, MN). All patients signed informed consent forms and the ethics committee approved the study protocol (No. 02289).

2.2 Evaluation of patients and determination of ISTH‐BAT

The evaluation of patients was done using a standardized protocol as proposed in previous recommendations. 4, 7, 13, 14, 15 Before consultation, patients completed a 13‐item, in‐house questionnaire assessing the presence and severity of bleeding at specific organs, including the skin, nose, oral cavity, gastrointestinal and urogenital systems, joints and muscles, bleeding in association with minor injuries, dental procedures, surgery, transfusion requirements, bleeding after ingestion of drugs known to affect hemostasis, and family history. 16 During the consultation, trained resident physicians took detailed history using a standardized form and applied the ISTH‐BAT. 7, 8 The scores were applied prior to laboratory testing and physicians were not aware of any laboratory test results. The ISTH‐BAT scorings were challenged by a second experienced physician (attending). Patients were instructed to stop anticoagulant treatment, antiaggregant treatment, nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs, and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 10 days prior to consultation. Potential bleeding stigmata including petechia, hematomas, as well as signs of amyloidosis, telangiectasia, or joint hyperflexibility, were documented after a thorough physical examination.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^a84b21db]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings", there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible". Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)", and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin".

### Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) [^4e071dc7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and hemothorax was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with BRUKINSA in clinical trials, with fatalities occurring in 0.2% of patients. Bleeding of any grade, excluding purpura and petechiae, occurred in 32% of patients.

Bleeding has occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Coadministration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3–7 days before and after surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

5.2 Infections

Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 26% of patients, most commonly pneumonia (7.9%), with fatal infections occurring in 3.2% of patients. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred.

Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

5.3 Cytopenias

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, developed in patients treated with BRUKINSA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 10% of patients, and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2.5% of patients.

Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment and interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed.

### The effect of follow-up reexamination on the long-term prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary angiography [^2bebc7d2]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Firstly, weigh the benefits of antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy against the risk of bleeding, including severe, life-threatening bleeding. Cardiologists should adjust the antithrombotic and anticoagulant treatment according to the patients' clinical status, such as skin purpura, melena, hematuria, as well as the results of blood routine and coagulation function tests. Secondly, lipid-lowering treatment should be initiated as early as possible after an ACS event, as it is associated with lower cardiovascular event rates. In all cases, lipid levels should be re-evaluated 4–6 weeks after each treatment or dose adjustment to determine whether treatment goals have been achieved and to check for any safety issues. Thirdly, the liver and kidney function of the patients should be monitored. In a prospective study, administering atorvastatin was found to have the risk of causing acute liver injury. In addition, inappropriate diuretic use may lead to electrolyte disturbances and further cause kidney injury. Fourthly, cardiologists should combine echocardiography, cardinal symptoms, and B-type natriuretic peptide to assess patients with suspected heart failure, and anti-heart failure therapy should be administered when necessary. In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after primary PCI, heart failure hospitalization within 1 year was independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization beyond 1 year. Therefore, timely adjustment of anti-heart failure treatment is essential. Fifthly, diabetes confers approximately a two-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease, and ACS patients with diabetes may more often present with non-specific symptoms, which may lead to delays in accessing care. A recent study has shown that better glycemic control can be achieved with more frequent follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, other systemic diseases should also be focused on. The process above requires the follow-up center to guide patients to undergo reexamination at appropriate times and regularly, which is conducive to timely adjustment of drugs and intervention, thereby effectively reducing the risk of adverse events.

### Palmar petechiae in a patient with diabetes mellitus [^40c943e1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old man with a history of celiac disease (CD), congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus complicated by end-stage renal disease and peripheral neuropathy, was admitted to the hospital for non-healing ulcerations of his hands with osteomyelitis from his peripheral arterial vascular disease. He reported that his CD was under good control with a strict gluten-free diet prior to admission. Physical exam revealed prominent petechiae on his bilateral palms and fingers (Fig 1). A biopsy was performed and demonstrated collections of neutrophils in the papillary dermis (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Arterial vascular disease
B. Capillaritis
C. Dermatitis herpetiformis
D. Janeway lesions
E. Rheumatoid vasculitis

Answers:
A. Arterial vascular disease – Incorrect. Cutaneous findings of arterial vascular occlusive disease typically include erosions, ulcers, and ischemic changes.
B. Capillaritis – Incorrect. Capillaritis classically presents as copper-brown macules and petechiae on the lower extremities.
C. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) – Correct. Palmar petechiae are a rare presentation of DH in adults and can result in delayed diagnosis when being the initial or isolated manifestation of disease. Although papules and vesicles on extensor surfaces in DH are pruritic, palmar petechiae may be pruritic, painful, or asymptomatic.
D. Janeway lesions – Incorrect. Janeway lesions are seen in bacterial endocarditis and present as angular hemorrhage on the palms.
E. Rheumatoid vasculitis – Incorrect. Rheumatoid vasculitis develops during advanced rheumatoid arthritis and can manifest as purpura, ulcerations, digital ischemia, and nodules on the hands.

### Extracardiac manifestations of infective endocarditis and their historical descriptions [^241fa728]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In his landmark "Gulstonian Lectures on Malignant Endocarditis", published in 1885, William Osler commented, "Few diseases present greater difficulties in the way of diagnosis than malignant endocarditis, difficulties which in many cases are practically insurmountable". At that time, the fields of microbiology and blood cultures were in their infancy, and the diagnosis was made premortem in just half the patients with the condition. After Osler's report, extracardiac physical findings became essential clues to earlier diagnosis. Today, infective endocarditis is most commonly suggested from the history and often clinched by an echocardiogram and blood cultures. Although prized physical manifestations are much less frequent now, they still do occur and may be an invaluable clue that leads to earlier, more effective treatment. The investigators review these extracardiac findings along with their historical descriptions: splinter hemorrhages, emboli, Osler's nodes, Janeway and Bowman lesions of the eye, Roth spots, petechiae, and clubbing.

### Management of bleeding risk in patients who receive anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on predictive and diagnostic variables in thrombotic disease [^c2df9973]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Bleeding risk assessment is an essential part of clinical decision‐making in the management of anticoagulation for VTE. Despite accumulating evidence for bleeding risk prediction, current VTE management guidelines lack specific recommendations on the management of bleeding predictors. Therefore, this SSC summarized the evidence and developed guidance on this topic.

When considering predictors associated with anticoagulant‐associated bleeding, an important step is to differentiate modifiable from non‐modifiable predictors. Given that the risk of bleeding is highest during the initiation and treatment phases of anticoagulant therapy, identifying modifiable predictors to decrease the bleeding risk is most relevant when VTE is diagnosed. We therefore recommend that a first bleeding risk assessment should take place upon diagnosis of VTE and before introduction of anticoagulant treatment for newly diagnosed VTE regardless of where the diagnosis occurs. Of the (potentially) modifiable predictors, hypertension, use of concomitant antiplatelet therapy or NSAIDs, anemia, and renal insufficiency were most consistently associated with higher bleeding risk. Although the association between antiplatelet agents and major bleeding in VTE patients was classified as limited in most studies, as patients using antiplatelet therapy were often excluded from the original studies, a recent meta‐analysis provides further support for this association, demonstrating that the combination of antiplatelet therapy with VKA or DOACs in VTE patients increases the risk of major bleeding (OR 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–1.63). Furthermore, in the AF population, both dual and triple anticoagulant therapy have been found to be associated with a substantially increased bleeding risk. As this predictor is easily identifiable and avoidable, we recommend reviewing the indication for dual or triple anticoagulant therapy in any VTE patients, both at initiation of anticoagulant therapy and during follow‐up. Although anemia is a symptom of bleeding rather than usually directly related to bleeding, and blood transfusion is unlikely to mitigate the bleeding risk, identifying and treating the cause of anemia may prevent bleeding complications. Identification of non‐modifiable predictors is helpful to inform patients and physicians about the absolute risk of events and determine net clinical benefit of treatment, which is particularly relevant for extended treatment. Furthermore, in AF patients, it has been shown that successful targeting of modifiable risk factors can be achieved by relatively simple interventions and can lead to reclassification of bleeding risk. Particularly, changes in risk factors over time were found to be more predictive for major bleeding than risk factors measured at baseline. Uncontrolled hypertension during follow‐up of anticoagulant therapy has been associated with an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Also, a decline in renal function has been associated with an increased bleeding risk, whereas improvement in renal function has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of anticoagulant related bleeding. Of note, VTE patients have a wider age range including younger patients with fewer co‐morbidities compared to the AF population, which may confound above assumptions.

### Petechiae and purpura… [^87b55a2e]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points The differential diagnosis for petechiae and/or purpura is broad, but in an ill-appearing child with sepsis must be at the top of the list. In a well-appearing child, petechiae and/or purpura should raise the possibility of a platelet disorder or another hemostatic defect. Facial petechiae after vaginal delivery in a well-appearing newborn likely result from birth trauma, but more diffuse petechiae warrant further investigation. If thrombocytopenia is accompanied by an abnormality of red and/or white blood cells, a bone marrow process should be considered.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^801ef748]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin risk stratification and age cautions — Prior U.S. guidelines recommended prophylactic aspirin only in the setting of elevated ASCVD risk, for example using risk estimators like the PCE or specific ASCVD risk factors, and historical meta-regression shows observed ASCVD risk tracks reasonably well with baseline-estimated ASCVD risk, whereas observed bleeding risk on aspirin is less well correlated. Scenarios associated with increased bleeding risk include a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding from other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin. Post hoc analysis of older trials suggests the benefit–risk ratio for prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable at > 10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, but prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults > 70 years of age is potentially harmful and difficult to justify for routine use.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^3b8ec569]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

COUMADIN can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with COUMADIN therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of COUMADIN therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli

Anticoagulation therapy with COUMADIN may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as "purple toes syndrome". Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

### Localized palmar angiokeratoma-like lesions following trauma [^7227cfe6]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Reports of medication-related eruptive angiokeratomas are rare and have mostly been attributed to anticoagulants enoxaparin and heparin. Our patient was not on an anticoagulant and had been on ibrutinib for more than 2 years. Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been reported to induce endothelial cell dysfunction and dysregulate, or inhibit, angiogenesis. While ibrutinib has not been reported to induce similar lesions, ibrutinib itself is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, as common cutaneous toxicities related to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors may commonly include ecchymosis and petechiae development. It is likely that the microtraumas initiated vascular lesion formation, and we may consider that ibrutinib's effect on bleeding allowed for persistence of lesions.

In conclusion, we present a case of palmar angiokeratoma-like lesions in a patient with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib. While the precise etiology of the patient's lesions is unclear, trauma was likely the inciting event, and concurrent use of ibrutinib may contribute to lesion persistence. While similar reports are rare, they also include patients with underlying hematologic conditions, possibly representing a common risk factor for this presentation.

The patient was treated with gabapentin for a right ulnar sensory mononeuritis. She was discharged on hospital day 8 with apixaban and, incidentally, continued the prednisone taper that antedated her admission.

Nine days later, she developed recurrence of painless petechiae while on apixaban and tapering to lower steroid doses. However, there was no evidence of deep-tissue ischemia or digital necrosis on examination (Fig 4). The patient was readmitted, administered glucocorticoids, and continued apixaban, which improved the petechiae. She was discharged on hospital day 3 with apixaban and prednisone taper. Follow-up laboratory tests and visits extending 7 months post-CF diagnosis did not demonstrate any signs or symptoms of connective tissue disease or cytopenia to suggest myeloid dyscrasia.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in an asymptomatic young healthy patient [^98afc10f]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous findings in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (SARS-CoV-2) are more common every day. Findings include, among others, pseudo-chilblains, vesicular, urticarial, and maculopapular eruptions. Livedo or necrosis is less common and, most importantly, suggests occlusive vascular disease usually related to severe coronavirus infection. Petechiae/purpuric rash can resemble dengue fever or appear as a morbilliform rash. This rash can spare palmoplantar skin and mucosa or presents with confluent erythematous macules, papules, and petechiae in asymmetric peri flexural distribution. It could represent a sign of milder coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease in which differential diagnosis includes drug-induced or viral rash and not necessarily a warning sign of thrombocytopenia.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an unusual form of COVID-19 presentation. In most cases, it appears in the context of an active coronavirus infection with skin petechiae or purpura being the only or more prominent sign of the disease.

Major Infection.

A new episode of clinical infection with pain, fever, drainage and/or leukocytosis in the setting of antimicrobial treatment (non-prophylactic). There should be a positive culture from the infected site or organ, unless there is strong clinical evidence that treatment is required despite negative cultures. The following are the general categories of infection:

Localized Infection.

The infection is limited to a specific organ or region, such as mediastinitis, and there is no evidence of systemic involvement (as defined by sepsis). This is determined through standard clinical methods and may be associated with evidence of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal infection, or may require empirical treatment.

Infection of the prosthesis or Endocarditis.

The following clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests are compatible with endocarditis: fever of 38. 0 °C or higher, positive blood cultures, new regurgitant murmurs or heart failure, the presence of embolic phenomena (such as focal neurologic impairment, glomerulonephritis, renal and splenic infarcts, and septic pulmonary infarcts), and peripheral cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesions (such as petechiae, conjunctival or splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler's nodes, and Roth spots). If echocardiography reveals a new intra-cardiac vegetation, along with or without other signs and symptoms, this should be considered sufficient evidence to support the diagnosis of endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the preferred diagnostic modality for prosthetic valve endocarditis.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Autoimmunity

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider promptly if they experience any symptoms of potential autoimmune disease. Give examples of important symptoms such as bleeding, easy bruising, petechiae, purpura, hematuria, edema, jaundice, or hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Advise patients of the importance of monthly blood and urine tests for 48 months following the last course of LEMTRADA to monitor for signs of autoimmunity because early detection and prompt treatment can help prevent serious and potentially fatal outcomes associated with these events. Advise patients that monitoring may need to continue past 48 months if they have signs or symptoms of autoimmunity.
Advise patients that LEMTRADA may cause hyperthyroid or hypothyroid disorders.
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms reflective of a potential thyroid disorder such as unexplained weight loss or gain, fast heartbeat or palpitations, nervousness, worsening tiredness, eye swelling, constipation, or feeling cold.
Advise women of childbearing potential of the risks of pregnancy with concomitant thyroid disease. Advise women of childbearing potential to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor.
Cases of autoimmune hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider right away if they develop signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice and/or dark urine, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acquired hemophilia A such as spontaneous bruising, nose bleeds, painful or swollen joints, other types of bleeding, or bleeding from a cut that may take longer than usual to stop.
Advise patients that cases of autoimmune encephalitis can occur after receiving LEMTRADA. This condition may include symptoms such as behavior and psychiatric changes, movement disorders, short-term memory loss or seizures, as well as other symptoms that may resemble an MS relapse.

Instructions for Patients

Advise patients to:

Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
If the prescribed dose of JANTOVEN is missed, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose of JANTOVEN the next day to make up for missed doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
Obtain prothrombin time tests and make regular visits to their physician or clinic to monitor therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
Be aware that if therapy with JANTOVEN is discontinued, the anticoagulant effects of JANTOVEN may persist for about 2 to 5 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
Avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. And to tell their physician if they fall often as this may increase their risk for complications.
Eat a normal, balanced diet to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. Avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of leafy, green vegetables [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].
Contact their physician to report any serious illness, such as severe diarrhea, infection, or fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)].
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing pain and discoloration of the skin (a purple bruise like rash) mostly on areas of the body with a high fat content, such as breasts, thighs, buttocks, hips and abdomen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing any unusual symptom or pain since JANTOVEN may cause small cholesterol or athero emboli. On feet it may appear as a sudden cool, painful, purple discoloration of toe(s) or forefoot [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
Immediately contact their physician when taking JANTOVEN after any heparin formulation therapy and experiencing bloody or black stools or appearance of bruises, or bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
To tell all of their healthcare professionals and dentists that they are taking JANTOVEN. This should be done before they have any surgery or dental procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
Carry identification stating that they are taking JANTOVEN.

### Provoked vs minimally provoked vs unprovoked VTE: does it matter? [^8eaf4b70]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial disease, and its risk depends on exposure to risk factors and predisposing conditions. Based on their strength of association with a VTE episode, risk factors are classified as major or minor and determined using a temporal pattern to be transient or persistent. All patients with VTE should receive anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months in the absence of an absolute contraindication. Beyond this period, selected patients may be candidates for an extended phase of anticoagulation aimed at secondary VTE prevention. The risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued is probably the main driver of decision-making regarding extended treatment. The risk of recurrence after VTE associated with major risk factors is low if the risk factor is no longer present. In this case, treatment can be discontinued. If the major risk factor is persistent, anticoagulation should be continued. After VTE occurring in the absence of risk factors, anticoagulation should probably be continued indefinitely if the risk for bleeding is low and preferably with minimal effective doses of anticoagulants. VTE occurring after exposure to minor risk factors is probably the most challenging situation, especially if the clinical manifestation was acute pulmonary embolism. Understanding the actual role of minor risk factors in the occurrence of VTE helps in estimating the risk of recurrence and avoiding the dangers associated with unnecessary anticoagulation. The availability of safer strategies for anticoagulation could allow personalized strategies for secondary prevention of VTE.

### Management of acute venous thromboembolism in patients taking antiplatelet therapy [^d8a98233]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Concomitant anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk, but most data are derived from patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) may differ.

Objective

To study the management of patients diagnosed with acute VTE while receiving antiplatelet treatment. The primary outcome was the number of patients discharged with concomitant therapy. Secondary outcomes were clinically relevant bleeding, cardiovascular events, recurrent VTE and death during follow-up, according to discharge therapy.

Methods

We performed a post-hoc analysis of patients included in two prospective registries, sharing the same case report form, from 2007 to 2017.

Results

Among the 1694 identified patients, 254 (15.0%) were receiving antiplatelet treatment at VTE diagnosis, of whom 61 (24.0%) were discharged with concomitant anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. In multivariable analysis, age ≥ 80 years-old and the use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for VTE therapy were associated with the decision to stop the antiplatelet, while having dual anti-platelet therapy at baseline, a history of coronaropathy or peripheral arterial disease were associated with concomitant anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. The decision to stop antiplatelet was associated with a non-significant 46% decrease in the risk of bleeding (OR 0.54 (0.16; 1.78)), and a non-significant 68% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events (OR 1.68 (0.44; 6.46)).

Conclusion

At acute VTE diagnosis, over 15% of patients were receiving antiplatelet agents, of whom 24% were discharged with concomitant anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. This therapeutic decision may be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, but an increased risk of bleeding.

### Long-term management of venous thromboembolism: a 61-year-old woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^745761ed]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Numerous randomized clinical trials have compared various durations of anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (ie, warfarin) for an initial episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and its genetic basis, clinical risk factors at presentation have emerged as the primary determinant of recurrence risk. Following a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulant therapy, patients with VTE in association with transient risk factors (eg, major surgery, trauma, pregnancy) have a low annual recurrence risk, while patients without identifiable provocative risk factors have a recurrence risk of approximately 25% at 4 years with the highest annual rates occurring in the first 2 years. Extending warfarin therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrences but is associated with increased rates of major and minor bleeding. Clinical decision making therefore requires individualized assessment of recurrence and bleeding risk, coupled with patient preference. After 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked VTE, male sex, age older than 65 years, and an elevated D-dimer level 1 month after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy are useful parameters in identifying patients with an increased recurrence risk. The case of Ms W, a woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism and hemorrhagic event while receiving anticoagulation, is used to illustrate clinical decision making to determine ongoing treatment.

Subacute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) A — direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy: In patients with subacute HIT A, the ASH guideline panel suggests treatment with a DOAC (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) rather than a VKA (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). Remarks indicate that several considerations may inform the choice of agent, including drug and patient factors, and that DOACs are preferred in clinically stable patients at average risk of bleeding. Evidence cited includes a systematic review of case series of 11 patients with HIT who received DOACs after platelet count recovery, among whom there were no thrombotic events; among 11 patients with probable HIT who were transitioned to DOACs, 1 patient had a major hemorrhage secondary to known varices. Additional considerations note that DOACs are more expensive than VKAs and may be more acceptable to patients because they do not require routine laboratory monitoring and dietary restrictions.

### ANCA-associated vasculitis with cardiac valve vegetations in two teenage males: two case reports and a literature review [^d220802e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

A thorough evaluation for infection ensued on day 6 of hospitalization, which was unremarkable aside from slightly positive Aspergillus antigen in his BAL (Table 2), though our Infectious Disease colleagues doubted this was a true-positive. On hospital day 6, a chest CT-Angiogram was completed to evaluate the extent of thromboembolic phenomenon given cardiac vegetations, which showed diffuse consolidation of both lungs without evidence of pulmonary arterial embolic disease. On hospital day 6, he developed splinter hemorrhages, followed by scattered petechiae on hospital day 7 consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis that was confirmed by skin biopsy. Repeat echocardiogram on hospital day 8 re-demonstrated small mitral valve vegetation and likely perforation of the anterior leaflet near the medial annulus (Fig. 3). Rheumatology was consulted on day 9 of hospitalization due to worsening hematuria (RBC on admission 6–10/hpf, hospital day 9 with RBC now > 100/hpf) with large hemoglobinuria and worsening urine protein/creatinine ratio (now 3.72), pulmonary hemorrhage, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, absence of a detectable source of infection (Table 2), and vegetations on echocardiogram with concern for an underlying rheumatologic disorder.

### Granulicatella bacteraemia in children: two cases and review of the literature [^96e680b9]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

NVS have been implicated in approximately 5% of cases of bacterial endocarditis in the adult population and carry a worse prognosis compared to infection with other streptococci. In patients with endocarditis caused by Granulicatella, classic endocarditis signs such as digital clubbing, Osler nodes and petechiae are rare. Pre-existing valvular pathology is a frequent predisposing factor. Because of the difficulties in isolating this organism its role as a pathogen in endocarditis could be underestimated. Consequently, some cases of culture-negative endocarditis could be attributed to this microorganism.

Here, we report two cases of paediatric NVS bacteraemia, one of which with confirmed heart localization and review of the literature.

### Rapidly progressing dyspnea and retiform purpura [^955b0385]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
B. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS)
C. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced vasculitis
D. ICI-induced thrombotic vasculopathy
E. Cryoglobulinemic vasculopathy

Answer:
A. Incorrect – Warfarin-induced necrosis typically occurs within 3 to 5 days of warfarin initiation with associated marked edema.
B. Incorrect – Noninflammatory dermal vascular thrombosis is common in APLS. Patients usually present before the age of 60 years, after multiple thrombotic events or miscarriages. Lupus anticoagulant may be falsely elevated in patients on direct anticoagulants, warfarin, and unfractionated heparin. Concomitant pneumonitis also makes APLS less likely.
C. Incorrect – The patient's biopsy does not show typical changes of vasculitis.
D. Correct – With recent ICI initiation, concomitant pneumonitis, diffuse vasculopathy, and negative infectious workup, the most likely diagnosis is ICI-induced thrombotic occlusive vasculopathy. Although the mechanisms for thrombotic vasculopathy associated with ICI are not fully elucidated, a pro-inflammatory state and elevated inflammatory cytokines likely play a role. To our knowledge, this is a novel case of durvalumab-induced retiform purpura. Other causes of thrombotic occlusive vasculopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, are unlikely with normal fibrinogen and no hemolysis. ICI toxicities, or immune-related adverse events (irAEs), usually affect the integumentary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and pulmonary systems. Cardiovascular toxicities, including acute vascular events (AVEs) such as vasculopathy, are rare, but may occur months after ICI initiation. In a retrospective review of 1215 patients on ICIs, the overall AVE event rate was 2.6%. Among lung adenocarcinoma patients, this rate doubled. History of prior AVE, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were also risk factors. Median survival was worse in those who developed an AVE versus those who did not (3 months vs 14 months; P < .0001).
E. Incorrect – The patient had negative cryoglobulinemic studies.

### A new risk scheme to predict warfarin-associated hemorrhage: the ATRIA (anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation) study [^00a05d3e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation bleeding risk score (ATRIA score)" for atrial fibrillation.

The ATRIA score, or Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation Bleeding Risk Score, is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients with atrial fibrillation. This scoring system is designed to assess the risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation who are on anticoagulation therapy. The ATRIA score takes into account several factors including age, prior bleeding, anemia, severe renal disease, and hypertension.

The clinical utility of the ATRIA score is to guide clinicians in making informed decisions about anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation, balancing the risk of stroke against the risk of major bleeding.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ATRIA score, but it is most applicable to patients with atrial fibrillation who are on anticoagulation therapy. It may not be as useful or accurate in patients without atrial fibrillation or those not receiving anticoagulation therapy.

The ATRIA bleeding risk score calculator is a tool used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation who are on warfarin therapy. It evaluates five specific risk factors, assigning a score to each, and uses the total to estimate the annual risk of hemorrhage.

For each factor, points are assigned as follows:

- **Age 75 years or older**: 2 points
- **Diagnosed hypertension**: 1 point
- **History of any hemorrhage**: 1 point
- **Hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL in males or less than 12 g/dL in females**: 3 points
- **Glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min or dialysis dependence**: 3 points

Each risk factor is considered as either present or absent (true or false). If a factor is present, its associated point value is added to a cumulative score. The total possible score ranges from 0 to 10.

The overall score determines the interpretation of the patient's annual risk of hemorrhage while on warfarin:

- A score between 0 and 3 suggests a low annual bleeding risk of approximately 0.76%.
- A score of 4 indicates a moderate risk, with an annual hemorrhage probability of about 2.62%.
- Scores of 5 or higher correspond to a high risk, with the annual probability of bleeding rising to approximately 5.76%.

This score assists healthcare providers in evaluating and managing anticoagulation treatment strategies, balancing the benefits of anticoagulation against its risks.

### Diagnostic approach to leukemia cutis: a differential diagnostic step-by-step algorithm [^b943d6d9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with leukemia cutis may have typically multiple, less often single lesions, usually representing nodules, plaques, and papules, but rarely, erythema, ulcers, or blisters may also appear. The most affected body parts are the legs, followed by arms, back, chest, scalp, and face, while palmoplantar and oral mucosa involvement is rare. Sites of previous or concomitant inflammation tend to be preferentially involved. It is important to note that a high proportion of patients with leukemia have skin lesions that are not leukemia cutis, mainly bleeding abnormalities (petechiae, purpurae) and infectious skin lesions due to cytopenia that should be taken into differential diagnostic considerations, both clinically and histologically.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis of Leukemia Cutis

Nonspecific Reactive Skin Lesions

Clinically and histologically, leukemia cutis can be confused with a wide array of skin conditions. The major clinical differential diagnoses are nonleukemic cutaneous manifestations of leukemia mentioned above that are known as leukemids. These cutaneous complications may be caused by various factors, such as cytopenias due to bone marrow failure, cutaneous side effects of antileukemic treatment, or immune-mediated diseases (eg, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, neutrophilic/eosinophilic/blistering dermatoses, herpesvirus disease). Together with the evidence for a major clinical impact of only histologically confirmed extramedullary leukemia manifestations, this suggests that, whenever possible, histologic confirmation in any suspect case of leukemia cutis should be attempted.

### Evaluating the child with purpura [^e0ca6aa5]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Purpura is the result of hemorrhage into the skin or mucosal membrane. It may represent a relatively benign condition or herald the presence of a serious underlying disorder. Purpura may be secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, coagulation factor deficiency or vascular defect. Investigation to confirm a diagnosis or to seek reassurance is important. Frequently, the diagnosis can be established on the basis of a careful history and physical examination, and a few key laboratory tests. Indicated tests include a complete blood cell count with platelet count, a peripheral blood smear, and prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times.

### Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^493d0365]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic adverse drug reaction occurring in < 0.1% to 7% of patients receiving heparin products depending on the patient population and type of heparin. Management of HIT is highly dependent on a sequence of tests for which clinicians may or may not have the results when care decisions need to be made. We conducted systematic reviews of the effects of management strategies in persons with acute HIT, subacute HIT A or B, and remote HIT. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database through July 2019 for previously published systematic reviews and primary studies. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We found primarily noncomparative studies and case series assessing effects of treatments, which led to low to very low certainty evidence. There may be little to no difference in the effects between nonheparin parenteral anticoagulants and direct oral anticoagulants in acute HIT. The benefits of therapeutic-intensity may be greater than prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. Using inferior vena cava filters or platelet transfusion may result in greater harm than not using these approaches. Evidence for management in special situations, such as for patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions or renal replacement therapy, was also low to very low certainty. Additional research to evaluate nonheparin anticoagulants is urgently needed, and the development of novel treatments that reduce thrombosis without increasing hemorrhage should be a priority.

### Clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity of confirmed dengue infections in Vietnamese children: is the World Health Organization classification system helpful? [^75e2fcbf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2004). Low credibility.

Classification of dengue using the current World Health Organization (WHO) system is not straightforward. In a large prospective study of pediatric dengue, no clinical or basic laboratory parameters clearly differentiated between children with and without dengue, although petechiae and hepatomegaly were independently associated with the diagnosis. Among the 712 dengue-infected children there was considerable overlap in the major clinical features. Mucosal bleeding was observed with equal frequency in those with dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and the tourniquet test differentiated poorly between the two diagnostic categories. Fifty-seven (18%) of 310 with shock did not fulfill all four criteria considered necessary for a diagnosis of DHF by the WHO, but use of the WHO provisional classification scheme resulted in considerable over-inflation of the DHF figures. If two separate entities truly exist rather than a continuous spectrum of disease, it is essential that some measure of capillary leak is included in any classification system, with less emphasis on bleeding and a specific platelet count.

PRESENTING FEATURES: An 18-year-old white man was admitted to the Osler Medical Service with the chief complaint of back pain. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed diffuse and aching upper back pain. Over the next couple of days, he also developed severe anterior chest pain that was somewhat pleuritic in nature but diffuse and extending bilaterally into the shoulders. One week prior to admission, he developed intermittent fevers and night sweats. The patient denied any lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, sick contacts, shortness of breath, rash, or bleeding. He was seen by a physician and told that he had thrombocytopenia. There was no history of recent or remote unusual bleeding episodes. His medical history was unremarkable except for a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He was not taking any medications and had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Physical examination showed that he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. He was a well-appearing man who was lying still because of pain. HEENT examination was unremarkable. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudates. His lungs were clear. His neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. Examination of his back and chest revealed no focal tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and his skin was without petechiae or rashes. Examination of the patient's joints showed pain on passive and active movement of his shoulders bilaterally, but no frank arthritis. There was no rash, petechiae, or echymoses. Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. On admission, the laboratory examination was notable for a hematocrit level of 32.5%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 79 fL, and white blood cell count of 2.8 × 10³/µL. Platelet count was 75 × 10³/µL. A white blood cell differential revealed 7% bands, 53% polys, 34% lymphs, 5% atypical lymphocytes, 2% nucleated red cells, and a few young unidentified cells.

The true incidence of bleeding from varicose veins is unknown due to under-reporting but appears to occur in approximately 4% of patients presenting with varicose veins. Bleeding often arises from small veins at the ankle with surrounding skin pigmentation and induration or following exacerbation of a venous ulcer leading to erosion of veins underlying the ulcer bed. Patients may report bleeding when the varicosities are exposed to warm water (in the shower or bathing), causing the veins to vasodilate, or bleeding can occur because of minor trauma. Patients with right heart failure or cardiomyopathy may also experience intermittent, often heavy, bleeding from dilated veins. Regardless of the cause, when a varicose vein ruptures, profuse bleeding can occur due to associated venous hypertension.

Although most bleeding associated with varicose veins is not associated with hypotension and does not require transfusion, fatal hemorrhage is an uncommon, but not entirely rare event. Most cases of fatal variceal hemorrhage have come from autopsy reports. A 2011 report documented < 100 fatalities over several decades. Twenty-three fatalities were reported in England and Wales in 2001. A systematic review including 17 articles found that deaths secondary to bleeding varicose veins accounted for 0.01% of autopsy cases. The victims were patients aged 60 to ≥ 90 years of age with no gender discrimination. Deaths due to hemorrhage occurred in older persons who lived alone, were mobility impaired, had skin fragility or an ulcer located near the malleolus, were on anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in the presence of ischemic heart disease. Another single-center study found that patients with bleeding episodes had decreased access to basic first aid or hemorrhage control techniques.

As many of the fatal hemorrhagic events can be prevented, it is critical that patients be asked about prior bleeding episodes, be warned about the possibility, and be instructed in first aid and hemorrhage control techniques, such as leg elevation and direct compression on the bleeding varicose veins. The danger of applying venous tourniquets and increasing venous pressure has often been emphasized in the literature.

### Oral anticoagulant monotherapy in patients with chronic coronary disease: an updated meta-analysis [^b9087a1d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with chronic coronary disease requiring long-term anticoagulation remains uncertain. While dual therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs) and antiplatelet agents is common, it significantly increases bleeding risk. This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of OAC monotherapy against combination therapy.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane library through August 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAC monotherapy to dual therapy (OAC plus a single antiplatelet agent) in patients with chronic coronary disease. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding.

Results

Five RCTs with 4964 participants were included. OAC monotherapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53–0.85). The risks of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and systemic embolism were comparable between the two groups. OAC monotherapy significantly reduced the risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31–0.77) and major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.38–0.68).

Conclusions

In patients with chronic coronary disease requiring long-term anticoagulation, OAC monotherapy reduces bleeding complications without increasing the risk of ischemic events compared to dual therapy. These findings support the use of a simplified antithrombotic strategy without antiplatelet therapy in this patient population.

3.4 Etiologies/risk factors

While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH, most cases occur unexpectedly. An easy way to remember the most common etiologies is to remember the four T's:
Tone: uterine atony (accounts for 70% of PPH cases).
Trauma: genital tract trauma.
Tissue: retained products of conception.
Thrombin: coagulopathy.

Uterine atony can be anticipated after prolonged labor particularly with the use of oxytocin, in pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis, high parity, general anesthesia, and other factors that lead to uterine overdistension such as multiple fetal gestation, polyhydramnios, and fetal macrosomia. Trauma accounts for 15%–20% of cases, and is mostly attributed to perineal or cervical lacerations, perineal hematomas, episiotomies, or uterine rupture. These occur in the setting of precipitous uncontrolled deliveries or operative vaginal deliveries. Retained products of conception can increase the risk of PPH by 3.5 times. Risk factors include succenturiate placenta and previous instrumentation. Coagulation problems can be divided into inherited, such as von Willebrand diseases, hemophilia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and acquired, such as the use of anticoagulant therapyand the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy after placental abruption, pre‐eclampsia with severe features, intrauterine fetal demise, sepsis, or amniotic fluid embolism. Other etiologies include uterine inversion and abnormal placentation.

### Cutaneous signs of systemic disease [^999830e9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

### Lerodalcibep in patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease… [^0e42cc28]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this trial, lerodalcibep, a novel anti-PCSK9 small binding protein, dosed monthly and stable at ambient temperatures significantly reduced LDL-C in patients with CVD or at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a safety profile similar to placebo. These results support long-term use of lerodalcibep in patients with CVD or at high risk of CVD who are unable to achieve adequate LDL-C reduction while receiving maximal tolerated statins alone. 4 Extensive data from statins and PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have provided evidence that for every approximately 40-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 22% to 24%. 2–4 Furthermore, trials inhibiting circulating PCSK9 have shown the relationship between absolute LDL-C reduction and CVD event reduction remains linear to very low LDL-C levels without signals of adverse events. 2, 3.

The change in LDL-C from baseline with lerodalcibep and placebo for the co-primary end points by mITT, ITT, and PP populations are shown in Table
2. For the mITT analysis, least-squares mean differences between lerodalcibep and placebo were −56. 19 at week 52 and −62. 69% at the mean of weeks 50 and
52. Lerodalcibep reduced free PCSK9 levels from baseline by a median of more than 90% at week 52 with LS mean reduction at week 52 of −76%. Mean fasting blood glucose as well as glycated hemoglobin levels were unchanged from baseline to week 52 in both lerodalcibep and placebo groups with no difference in the incidence of adverse events related to glycemic control between the groups. There were 59 investigator-reported cardiovascular adjudicated events, 24 in the placebo group and 35 in the lerodalcibep group.

### Critical bleeding in adults and children with immune thrombocytopenia: a multicenter cohort study [^4537d993]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics, treatment approaches, and outcomes for adults and children with ITP who presented to the ER with severe thrombocytopenia and experienced a critical bleed. Our results highlight factors associated with critical bleeding in both adults and children and variables associated with higher mortality among patients who experienced a critical bleed. Our findings underscore the high mortality of these rare events, delays in time to first treatment, and the need for a standardized approach to management.

The frequency of critical bleeds in ITP was rare, occurring in 5.1% of adults and 1.4% of children who presented to the ER with a platelet count < 20 × 10⁹/L. Nevertheless, these events were associated with a high risk of death: 46.7% in adults and 15.4% in children. Although most critical bleeds were ICH (80.0% in adults and 46.2% in children), nearly one-fourth of critical bleeds in children were gynecological bleeds (23.1%). Adults and children in older age groups had a higher rate of critical bleeds. A previous systematic review also found that ICH was more common in adults than children (1.4% vs 0.4%), and previous studies have reported that older age was associated with more frequent and more severe bleeding. We found that critical bleeds occurred more often in patients during the chronic stage of ITP; however, for 12 of 28 patients (42.9%), critical bleeding was the initial presentation of ITP (n = 8 adults; n = 4 children). Adults with comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, or transient ischemic attack, and who were receiving anticoagulation had a higher rate of critical bleeds. This finding underscores the need for careful monitoring and risk assessment in these high-risk populations. In a French ITP registry (n = 302) that reported 20 major bleeds defined as gross hematuria, gastrointestinal, or intracranial bleeds, exposure to anticoagulants was associated with major bleeds.

### Predictive value of venous thromboembolism (VTE)-BLEED to predict major bleeding and other adverse events in a practice-based cohort of patients with VTE: results of the XALIA study [^c07c44b8]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Study setting and patients

The design of the XALIA study and patients' selection criteria were published elsewhere (Ageno et al, 2014). In short, patients with a confirmed DVT aged 18 years or older and with an indication (and no contraindication) for anticoagulant treatment duration of at least 3 months were eligible for inclusion. DVT was confirmed according to current diagnostic standards. Patients were treated with either rivaroxaban or conventional anticoagulation therapy, starting with a course of parenteral anticoagulants, usually followed by a vitamin K antagonist. The decision to treat a patient with rivaroxaban or conventional anticoagulants was at the attending physician's discretion. The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved the study and all patients provided written informed consent.

Patients were followed for at least 12 months or until they died. Major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding associated with a decrease in haemoglobin of 20 g/l or more, or requiring a transfusion of two or more units of blood (or red blood cell concentrates), occurred in a critical site (i.e. intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra‐articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal), or contributed to death, based on the on the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) (Schulman & Kearon, 2005). Recurrent VTE was defined as new‐onset symptoms of DVT or PE with the final diagnosis confirmed by objective tests according to the current standard or death in which PE could not be ruled out or an autopsy confirmed PE as the primary cause of death. All outcome events were adjudicated by the independent Clinical Events Committee whose members were unaware of the treatment assignment. Only treatment‐emergent events, i.e. events occurring up to 2 days after terminating active anticoagulant treatment, were included in this post‐hoc analysis.

The current study excluded all patients who (i) did not use anticoagulant treatment beyond the first 30 days, (ii) who died or experienced recurrent VTE or major bleeding during the first 30 days and (iii) those who received a vitamin K antagonist for 1–14 days or parenteral anticoagulation for 3–14 days before they were switched to rivaroxaban ('early switchers') (Klok et al, 2016).

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^6327a11b]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Better selection of patients for extended venous thromboembolism (VTE) therapy — first unprovoked events: In patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) without a high risk of bleeding, patient sex and a D-dimer measured about 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy can help stratify recurrence risk; men have about a 75% higher (1.75-fold) risk than women, a positive D-dimer has about double the risk vs a negative result, and the predictive value of the two factors appears additive. In women with a negative posttreatment D-dimer, risk appears similar to that for proximal DVT or PE provoked by a minor transient risk factor (approximately 15% recurrence at 5 years), whereas in men with a negative D-dimer the risk is not much less than that estimated for unprovoked proximal DVT or PE (approximately 25% compared with approximately 30% recurrence at 5 years); D-dimer testing will often influence a woman's decision but will often not influence a male's decision. Because there is still uncertainty about how to use D-dimer testing and a patient's sex to make decisions about extended therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE, we have not made recommendations based on these factors, though a qualifying remark notes that sex and D-dimer measured a month after stopping anticoagulant therapy may influence this treatment decision.

Management of Severe Cardiovascular Disease

Recommendations

- It is recommended that the decision to use invasive cardiovascular interventions in patients with advanced malignancies be guided by a multidisciplinary team.

Gaps in knowledge

- The net clinical benefit of invasive cardiovascular interventions in patients with advanced malignancies is unknown.

There are limited data from randomized controlled trials or comprehensive prospective cohort studies to inform the role of invasive cardiovascular interventions in patients with severe cardiovascular disease who also have metastatic cancer with a guarded cancer-specific prognosis. Therefore, decision making for these patients should be highly individualized and inclusive of all relevant stakeholders. Key factors to consider in this decision-making process should include 1) the expected magnitude and immediacy of benefits from the invasive cardiovascular procedure; 2) potential risks associated with the procedure; 3) the prognosis of the malignancy; 4) the patient goals of care and comorbidities (including thrombocytopenia); and 5) the consequences of interruptions during cancer treatments.

Objective To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms associated with aspirin use. To update its 2016 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD.

The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on CRC incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms, particularly bleeding harms, associated with aspirin use. 14, 25. A pooled analysis of 11 trials showed that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. Similarly, a pooled analysis of 5 trials demonstrated that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke. ASPREE reported that aspirin use was associated with statistically significantly higher CRC mortality at 4. 7 years of follow-up, while the WHS did not find a statistically significant increase in CRC mortality at 10 years.

Epipodophyllotoxins (Etoposide [VP16], Teniposide [VM26]) — survivors exposed to these agents have a potential late effect of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Periodic evaluation includes history for fatigue, bleeding, and easy bruising yearly, up to 10 years after exposure to agent, and physical dermatologic exam for pallor, petechiae, purpura yearly, up to 10 years after exposure to agent. Counseling advises: Promptly seek medical attention for fatigue, pallor, petechiae or bone pain. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention are CBC and bone marrow exam as clinically indicated. System categorization is SYSTEM = SMN SCORE = 1. Additional information notes that etopodophyllotoxin administration schedules have been modified since approximately 1990 to reduce the risk of AML, and there is negligible benefit to obtaining a screening CBC in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms for AML. Risk assessment should consider patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk, including cancer/treatment factors such as weekly or twice weekly administration, < 5 years since exposure to agent, autologous HCT, and that evidence is conflicting that splenectomy modifies risk for AML.

5.6 Immune Thrombocytopenia

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurred in 2% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in MS clinical studies (controlled and open-label extension).

In a controlled clinical study in patients with MS, one LEMTRADA-treated patient developed ITP that went unrecognized prior to the implementation of monthly blood monitoring requirements, and died from intracerebral hemorrhage. Nadir platelet counts ≤ 20,000 cells per microliter as a result of ITP occurred in 2% of all LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies in MS. Anti-platelet antibodies did not precede ITP onset. ITP has been diagnosed more than 3 years after the last LEMTRADA dose.

Symptoms of ITP include easy bruising, petechiae, spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, hemoptysis), and heavier than normal or irregular menstrual bleeding. Hemoptysis may also be indicative of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. Remind the patient to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns.

Obtain complete blood counts (CBCs) with differential prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP is suspected, a complete blood count should be obtained immediately. If ITP onset is confirmed, promptly initiate appropriate medical intervention.

5.3 Discontinuation of Prasugrel Tablets

Discontinue thienopyridines, including prasugrel, for active bleeding, elective surgery, stroke, or TIA. The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for cardiac events. Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.1, 4.2) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

TTP has been reported with the use of prasugrel. TTP can occur after a brief exposure (< 2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that can be fatal and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragment red blood cells] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].

Similarly, the mainstay of ET management includes cardiovascular risk assessment and aspirin as described for PV. Cytoreduction is reserved to lower the platelet count in some patients with intermediate and all with high-risk disease, including those with previous stroke. With very high platelet counts (> 1,000,000/µL), an acquired von Willebrand syndrome can develop and bleeding may occur. In this acquired deficiency of von Willebrand factor, aspirin is contraindicated until platelet count is reduced to < 1,000,000/µL by cytoreduction.

In patients with PV or ET and an acute stroke, the recommendations for the treatment of the different types of stroke should be followed. Platelet counts should be monitored frequently during unfractionated heparin treatment, to detect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. For patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, oral anticoagulation should be given for at least 6 months, unless contraindicated. There is not yet high-quality evidence to support the use of DOACs in MPN, but randomized-controlled trials are ongoing.

Bleeding risk scores and anticoagulation decision-making — Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS–BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA) are based on clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.

Clinical Presentation (Symptoms, Microbiology, and Imaging Findings)

Patient characteristics and clinical presentations were compared across the study groups. Infections were classified into 3 categories: (1) community-acquired infections; (2) nosocomial healthcare–associated infections, defined as infections occurring after any hospital admission within 3 months of the first symptoms of IE; and (3) nonnosocomial health care–associated infections, defined as infections occurring after any outpatient visits or medical procedures within 3 months of the first symptoms. Symptoms included the following: fever (temperature > 38° C), muscle pain located in proximal limb musculature, back, or neck; dyspnea; and unintentional weight loss of > 5 kg. Clinical signs of immunological and vascular phenomena, including splinters, petechiae, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and Roth spots, were recorded if they were described in the medical records. Complications related to IE evident on admission were also documented, including sepsis, systemic embolism, severe valve regurgitation, or heart block, all based on the description of them in the medical records or the conclusions of imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The most likely microbiological cause was grouped according to the type of bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and others (including Haemophilus spp, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae [HACEK], as well as fungal infections). Significant echocardiographic findings were documented from the echocardiography reports. This included localization of vegetation, vegetation size, valve insufficiency of the affected valve/valves, signs of other valve diseases, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography was deemed diagnostic if the echocardiography was inconclusive and the reported results of the positron emission tomography/computed tomography verified the suspicion of IE (eg, enhanced fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in PVE).

At present, in all other patientswe continue treatment with eculizumab indefinitely. The major risk associated with eculizumab treatment is the development of meningococcal disease. All patients are vaccinated with a tetravalent vaccine before the onset of treatment and, in addition, receive long‐term prophylactic antibiotics (either penicillin or erythromycin) because current vaccines do not cover Serogroup B strains. We will in the future be testing the response to vaccination after 12 weeks and re‐vaccinating if the response is suboptimal.

Emergency identification in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — in patients with a history of HIT more than 3 months ago, the ASH panel suggests against carrying or wearing an emergency identifier (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects); although there may be small benefit for patients with a history of HIT diagnosed more than 3 months ago, this is uncertain, and avoidance of heparin could result in inferior treatment.

### Purpura fulminans: recognition, diagnosis and management [^8b9e1c67]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Purpura fulminans (PF) is a haematological emergency in which there is skin necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This may progress rapidly to multi-organ failure caused by thrombotic occlusion of small and medium-sized blood vessels. PF may complicate severe sepsis or may occur as an autoimmune response to otherwise benign childhood infections. PF may also be the presenting symptom of severe heritable deficiency of the natural anticoagulants protein C or protein S. Early recognition and treatment of PF is essential to reduce mortality and to prevent major long-term health sequelae. However, management strategies require accurate identification of the underlying cause. This review focuses on the clinical features, differential diagnosis and laboratory features of the range of PF disorders and includes expert consensus opinion about immediate and on-going management.

### Acquired von Willebrand syndrome: focused for hematologists [^5dc4e95c]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) is a rare bleeding disorder with laboratory findings similar to those of inherited von Willebrand disease. However, unlike the inherited disease, AvWS occurs in persons with no personal and family history of bleeding and is often associated with a variety of underlying diseases, most frequently lymphoproliferative, myeloproliferative and cardiovascular disorders. After the presentation of a typical case, in this narrative review we discuss the more recent data on the pathophysiology, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic aspects of this acquired bleeding syndrome. We chose to focus particularly on those aspects of greater interest for the hematologist.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with an intermediate-probability 4Ts score — initial anticoagulation approach: In patients with suspected HIT and an intermediate-probability 4Ts score who have another indication for therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation, the ASH guideline panel recommends discontinuation of heparin (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence about effects). For patients with an intermediate-probability 4Ts score, the ASH guideline panel suggests initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant at prophylactic intensity if the patient is at high risk of bleeding and at therapeutic intensity if the patient is not at high risk of bleeding (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence about effects).

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients without prior lower extremity intervention — low dose rivaroxaban added to aspirin versus aspirin alone: For every 1000 patients treated, 27 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or major adverse limb events (MALE) including major amputation would be prevented and one fatal and one critical organ bleed would be caused over a 21-month period, with an increased rate of major bleeding of 3% vs 2% (HR, 1.6; P = 0.0089) and no significant increase in fatal or symptomatic critical organ or surgical site bleeding at 1% vs 1% (HR, 1.13). The evidence base is a single randomized clinical trial consistent with VOYAGER, resource requirements include a retail price of $609/month, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is not formally studied, equity impact is not studied and would depend on access to rivaroxaban, acceptability may be influenced by out-of-pocket costs and the need for an additional BID drug with bruising/minor bleeding, and feasibility is stated as Yes, medical therapy alone (thus feasible).
