## Question

how long does thyroid replacement take to change labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for thyroid replacement therapy to change laboratory results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which labs we are actually monitoring and why. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics of levothyroxine and the time to steady state. Next, I will review guideline-recommended intervals for rechecking TSH and free T4 after initiation or dose changes. After that, I should consider special populations and scenarios that alter timing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline and note exceptions and caveats that could modify expectations.

> Let me first confirm the key laboratory endpoints we rely on in practice. For primary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is the primary therapeutic target because it reflects pituitary feedback and is the most sensitive marker for adjusting levothyroxine dose, whereas free T4 is used to classify disease and, in central hypothyroidism, to guide therapy since TSH is unreliable in that setting [^32fb5434] [^ca3e5068] [^6bf11f69]. Wait, let me verify the role of T3; routine T3 monitoring is not recommended in primary hypothyroidism because TSH normalization does not guarantee normal T3, and the clinical significance of low-normal T3 on LT4 is uncertain, so I should not overinterpret T3 changes when they occur [^99f896d2] [^22a0e0c5].

> Next, I should review the pharmacokinetics to estimate time to steady state. Levothyroxine has a long half-life of about 6–7 days in euthyroid adults, which implies that after a dose change it takes roughly 4–5 half-lives, or about 4–6 weeks, to reach a new steady state and for TSH to stabilize, which is why guidelines align recheck intervals with this window [^07a7b05d] [^4881bc8a]. Hold on, I should verify whether smaller dose changes take longer to manifest; yes, with smaller increments, TSH may continue to drift for up to 8 weeks before plateauing, which is why some guidance extends the interval to 8 weeks in certain contexts [^7c400ceb].

> I will now examine the standard adult monitoring cadence. Major guidelines consistently recommend checking TSH 4–6 weeks after starting therapy or after any dose change, then repeating every 4–6 weeks until the target TSH is achieved, followed by monitoring every 6–12 months once stable, with dose adjustments typically in 12.5–25 mcg steps [^07a7b05d] [^4881bc8a] [^40f61ce6]. Wait, let me double-check the rationale for not shortening the interval; because of the long half-life, earlier checks risk misinterpretation of transient shifts and premature dose changes, so 4–6 weeks is the evidence-based minimum [^07a7b05d].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population or scenario. In pregnancy, TSH should be checked every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and again later in gestation because maternal-fetal demands shift rapidly and dose requirements often increase by 30% or more, so the monitoring cadence is intensified compared with nonpregnant adults [^1be19404]. In infants and children with congenital hypothyroidism, follow-up is far more frequent, with checks every 1–2 weeks early on and every 2–4 months thereafter, reflecting rapid growth and neurodevelopmental sensitivity, so I need to ensure I do not conflate adult timelines with pediatric care [^19189405]. For central hypothyroidism, I should confirm that TSH is not used to titrate; instead, free T4 is monitored 4–6 weeks after changes to keep FT4 in the mid-to-upper reference range, which changes the lab we track and the interpretation timeline [^d6e14e53] [^6bf11f69].

> Hold on, I should verify factors that can delay or confound lab stabilization. Poor adherence, interactions with calcium, iron, PPIs, soy, and certain foods, as well as inconsistent timing relative to meals, can impair absorption and prolong the time to a stable TSH, so I need to check these before escalating dose prematurely [^4790fd1b] [^b72754b5]. I also need to remember that switching LT4 brands or formulations, while often safe, can transiently alter absorption; guidelines still advise rechecking TSH 4–6 weeks after any such change to ensure the same biochemical control, even though contemporary data suggest many generic switches do not materially change TSH outcomes [^ed1b4d82] [^4a1e66d7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all switches mandate a change in dose; that is too strong — many patients remain stable, but prudence dictates a recheck to avoid unrecognized under- or over-replacement [^ed1b4d82].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline and sanity-check it against the evidence. For most adults with primary hypothyroidism, expect TSH to begin shifting within 1–2 weeks of a dose change, but wait until 4–6 weeks to recheck and make dose adjustments, repeating every 4–6 weeks until the target TSH is reached, then monitoring every 6–12 months once stable. Smaller dose changes may require up to 8 weeks to fully plateau, so if the clinical picture is discordant, I should confirm adherence and interactions before changing dose again [^07a7b05d] [^7c400ceb] [^4881bc8a]. I should confirm that symptoms lag behind labs; indeed, some hypothyroid manifestations can take 3–6 months to resolve after biochemical euthyroidism is achieved, so I should counsel patients accordingly to avoid premature dose escalation [^7c400ceb].

> I need to ensure I address the central hypothyroidism exception explicitly. In central disease, TSH is unreliable for titration, so I should monitor free T4 every 4–6 weeks after initiation or dose changes and aim to keep FT4 in the mid-to-upper reference range, recognizing that a low TSH in this context may actually reflect adequate replacement rather than excess [^d6e14e53] [^6bf11f69]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not suggesting TSH targets in central hypothyroidism; that would be incorrect, and I should correct that impulse if it arises [^6bf11f69].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line is consistent with high-quality guidance. The convergent recommendation across ATA and AACE/ACE documents is to reassess TSH 4–6 weeks after any change in LT4 therapy, titrate in small increments until the target is reached, and then space monitoring to 6–12 month intervals once stable, with earlier checks for pregnancy, pediatrics, central hypothyroidism, or suspected adherence or absorption issues, which aligns with the pharmacokinetic rationale and available evidence [^07a7b05d] [^4881bc8a] [^40f61ce6].

Thyroid replacement therapy (levothyroxine) produces measurable changes in thyroid labs within **2–4 weeks** [^7c400ceb], with TSH typically stabilizing by **6–8 weeks** after initiation or dose adjustment [^7c400ceb]. Free T4 rises within days, but TSH changes lag due to pituitary feedback delays [^5813fa7a]. Routine TSH monitoring should occur **every 6–8 weeks** until stable, then every 6–12 months [^40f61ce6]; in pregnancy, monitor every 4 weeks in the first trimester [^1be19404]. Factors such as adherence, absorption, and drug interactions can delay or blunt lab changes, so reassess these if labs are unexpected [^80fb55bf] [^4790fd1b].

---

## Timeframe for laboratory changes

### Initiation of therapy

- **Free T4**: Increases within 2–3 days of starting levothyroxine, reflecting rapid absorption and distribution [^notfound].
- **TSH**: Begins to decline within 2–4 weeks, but full suppression to the new steady state takes 6–8 weeks due to pituitary feedback kinetics [^7c400ceb].
- **Free T3**: Changes are slower and may lag several weeks, as T3 is largely generated peripherally from T4 [^notfound].

---

### Dose adjustments

After a dose change, **TSH stabilizes within 6–8 weeks**, consistent with the time needed to reach a new steady state [^7c400ceb]. Free T4 responds within **2–4 weeks**, whereas free T3 changes are slower and may take 4–6 weeks to stabilize [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines for monitoring

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended monitoring interval** |
|-|-|
| Initiation or dose adjustment of levothyroxine | 6–8 weeks [^7c400ceb] |
| Stable maintenance therapy | Every 6–12 months [^40f61ce6] |
| Pregnancy (first trimester) | Every 4 weeks [^1be19404] |
| Pregnancy (second and third trimesters) | Every 4–6 weeks [^notfound] |
| Central hypothyroidism | Free T4 every 6–8 weeks until stable [^edfab0f1] |

---

## Factors influencing the time to laboratory changes

Several factors can **delay or blunt laboratory responses** to thyroid replacement therapy:

- **Adherence**: Nonadherence is a common cause of persistent TSH elevation [^80fb55bf].
- **Absorption**: Interactions with calcium, iron, PPIs, and certain foods can impair absorption and delay response [^4790fd1b].
- **Drug interactions**: Enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine) can increase metabolism and reduce efficacy.
- **Formulation changes**: Switching brands or generics may alter bioavailability and require reassessment [^ed1b4d82].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or inadequate laboratory response

If labs fail to normalize within the expected timeframe, **evaluate adherence, absorption, and interactions** before escalating the dose [^80fb55bf] [^4790fd1b]. Persistent TSH elevation despite adherence and proper timing may indicate malabsorption or drug interactions, warranting further evaluation or alternative formulations [^ff65aacc]. Conversely, **suppressed TSH with elevated free T4** signals overtreatment and increases risks of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis, necessitating dose reduction [^885eb1b1].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Initial response**: Free T4 rises within 2–3 days; TSH declines by 2–4 weeks.
- **Steady state**: TSH stabilizes by 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose change [^7c400ceb].
- **Monitoring**: TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months [^40f61ce6].
- **Pregnancy**: Monitor TSH every 4 weeks in the first trimester [^1be19404].
- **Delays**: Adherence, absorption, and interactions can delay or blunt response [^80fb55bf] [^4790fd1b].

---

Thyroid replacement therapy produces measurable lab changes within **2–4 weeks**, with TSH stabilizing by **6–8 weeks**. Regular, guideline-directed monitoring and attention to adherence and interactions ensure timely achievement of biochemical euthyroidism.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH — Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

Triiodothyronine monotherapy for hypothyroidism — The guideline states that "longer-term controlled clinical trials using a longer-acting form of triiodothyronine are needed before considering the endorsement of synthetic liothyronine therapy for routine clinical use" and rates this as "Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". While "thrice-daily synthetic liothyronine may be associated with beneficial effects on parameters such as weight and lipids", pharmacologic considerations include that "multiple daily dosing is required to sustain serum T3 levels given the much shorter half-life of LT3, compared with LT4" and reported "half-life values ranging from 6 to 22 hours". Experimental data further indicate that "normalization of serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH expression with T3 monotherapy requires serum T3 levels in the supranormal range".

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^86ea8869]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In clinical terms, these findings corroborate the current recommendations for management of hypothyroid patients. However, by showing effects on all cause mortality when hypothyroidism is suboptimally treated, our findings challenge the notion of a "benign" disease and underline the need for diligent monitoring, which is sometimes overlooked during the long course of the disease in real life scenarios. In the study dataset, 11.6% and 32.4% of the annual TSH measures were below (< 0.4 mIU/L) or above (> 4 mIU/L) the recommended optimal range, respectively, which is largely in line with previous relevant reports.

Strengths and limitations of study

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has taken variation of TSH concentrations over time (years) into account in the design. An earlier study by Flynn et al included multiple TSH measures for each patient but used these to create a single weighted mean value that was used to assign patients to one of four categories (suppressed, low, normal, and high TSH); the method did not account for changes in TSH concentration or category during the follow-up period. The results obtained using our methods are reassuring and suggest that misclassification bias, resulting from different TSH concentrations during the course of life in any individual, had a minimal effect on the outcomes studied. This, combined with the rigorous selection of covariates and a large and well powered study population, enabled us to explore a comprehensive list of relevant outcomes reflecting the full spectrum of cardiovascular disease.

Main text

In this article, we take a closer look how these technical changes may have impacted on patient care. A transition occurred from the era of low metabolic rate regarded as synonymous with hypothyroidism to a purely biochemically based definition. Hence, TSH measurement became the new determinant of hypothyroidism. Consequently, treatment habits changed over the last decade and were more related to laboratory records than subjective patient experience. In particular, LT4 replacement doses tended to decrease, as a suppressed TSH was viewed as evidence of overtreatment. However, for two reasons this is an area of considerable uncertainty. Firstly, thyroid-related patient complaints overlap with a plethora of non-specific symptoms caused by other conditions and diseases. Thyroid tests are also more likely to be obtained in patients with unspecific symptoms. In these conditions, LT4 treatment may not be superior to placebo in symptom alleviation. Secondly, TSH is increasingly recognised to be less reliable as a definitive diagnostic tool than previously assumed. Not only is its reference interval not universally agreed on or adjusted for various influences, such as ethnicity, iodine supply, age, but the univariate statistical derivation of a TSH reference range is inherently ill-defined owing to its nature as a controlling element. Physiologically, stimulation by TSH raises thyroid hormones to a level appropriate to the optimal well-being of a person. Because TSH, FT4 and FT3 are interrelated through the operation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback regulation, integrated pairs of TSH and FT4 values define the so-called individual set points. Unlike a population-based univariate reference interval, set points are subject to multivariate normality and narrow homeostatic ranges. When plotting TSH against FT4 concentrations the resulting distribution in a healthy population does not describe the familiar rectangle, but a kite-shaped area. Accordingly, a TSH value can be indicative of true euthyroidism in an individual despite it slightly exceeding the upper reference limit, while a TSH measurement within that reference interval may represent a truly hypothyroid subject. Isolated TSH interpretation thereby becomes ambiguous, resulting in unacceptable diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty surrounding a given TSH measurement when it approaches the TSH euthyroid range. As a consequence, this strategy divorces diagnostic disease definitions from treatment targets. Rationally therefore, the triple roles of TSH as a screening test, diagnostic tool and therapeutic target require separate assessment. Diagnostic reliability for patients may be improved by reconstructing personal TSH-FT4 set points, depending on whether this novel approach can be confirmed in clinical trials.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^04a4a7e0]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

American Thyroid Association guideline — starting dose strategies indicate that several approaches to initiating LT4 therapy are acceptable, including basing the starting dose on the serum thyrotropin (TSH) level, with full replacement doses roughly 0.73 µg/lb or 1.6 µg/kg body weight when the serum TSH is markedly elevated, and lower doses such as 25–50 µg for milder degrees of hypothyroidism.

Inadequate levothyroxine — harms and treatment goal: "The adverse effects of thyroid hormone deficiency include detrimental effects on the serum lipid profile and progression of cardiovascular disease. We recommend that patients with overt hypothyroidism be treated with doses of levothyroxine that are adequate to normalize serum thyrotropin levels, in order to reduce or eliminate these undesirable effects. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence".

For the treated hypothyroid individuals, timing of LT4 dose may also be a factor as described by Jansen et al. in 2023. The authors concluded that the observed FT4 concentrations above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range together with not (completely) suppressed TSH were mainly related to a combination of timing of blood withdrawal and the timing of LT4 intake.

We accept that there are significant limitations to the laboratory data set as we do not have information about actual thyroid condition diagnosis, nor do have information as to the type, dose or duration of thyroid hormone replacement. Ethnicity was not available to us. Nevertheless, we have been able to analyse a larger number of laboratory results, and we are confident that we have adequately differentiated screening of untreated individuals from monitoring of patients treated with thyroid hormone replacement.

In conclusion, a better understanding of the relationship between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 in patients vs the physiological equipoise, could allow more tailored and effective therapy for patients with hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients starting or increasing levothyroxine — therapeutic goal: The therapeutic goal of levothyroxine replacement in non-critically ill patients is long-term normalization of serum thyrotropin when steady-state thyroid hormone levels are achieved, and levothyroxine should not be titrated to serum free thyroxine levels unless serum thyrotropin cannot be relied upon. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on current clincial trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomised manner. Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target, and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

Levothyroxine product switching and monitoring — The text notes that "such evidence favors consistent use of the same identifiable formulation of LT4 to avoid altered absorption potentially resulting in a different serum TSH", and further states, "if a patient's LT4 product is switched, the endocrine societies recommend that the patient undergo repeat assessment of their thyroid status once steady state has been achieved".

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^3739e1af]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

Our findings may have important implications for research and clinical practice. The finding that long term outcomes remain similar across a wide range of "normal" TSH concentrations supports flexibility in the levothyroxine dosing schemes to preserve TSH within the normal range. Extrapolating, this is also supportive of the not uncommonly overlooked importance of an individual's set point in thyroid homoeostasis, as opposed to the laboratory reference. Related to the above, the local, tissue level activation or inactivation of thyroid hormones by deiodination (D2 and D3 deiodinases, which are critical determinants of the cytoplasmic triiodothyronine pool) may provide the individual with the necessary buffering capacity to control the activation of thyroid receptors at the tissue level according to the individual's needs, provided that this buffering capacity is not overwhelmed by high or low hormone concentrations. From a clinical perspective, this study provides strong support for the current recommendations on the clinical management of hypothyroid patients and validates with hard evidence the latest American Thyroid Association and British Thyroid Association guidelines.

Conclusions

Using repeated measures of TSH concentration over time in a well balanced and highly powered study population, we observed no clinically meaningful difference in the pattern of long term health outcomes, including all cause mortality, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, all fractures, and fragility fractures, in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism when TSH concentrations lie within normal limits. However, targets for individual patients should be considered in line with their clinical needs.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

Levothyroxine (LT4) administration timing — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) outcomes are influenced by proximity to meals and time of day. Consuming breakfast within 20 minutes after LT4 produced higher TSH than when breakfast occurred 60 minutes after LT4, while a retrospective nursing-home study reported TSH values were unaffected when dosing changed from 9 am (1–2 hours after breakfast) to midnight (3 hours after a snack). In a parallel study comparing 30 minutes before breakfast versus evening dosing, at 12 weeks TSH was 5.13 mIU/L versus 2.17 mIU/L, and these results were not statistically different. Two cross-over trials found the lowest TSH either 1 hour before breakfast or at bedtime; in one, mean TSH was 1.06, 2.93, and 2.19 mIU/L when LT4 was taken at least 1 hour before breakfast, with breakfast, or at bedtime over 8 weeks, and another double-blind study showed TSH was 0.9–1.6 mIU/L higher with morning versus bedtime dosing over 12 weeks. A further cross-over study observed higher, more variable TSH when LT4 was taken with breakfast compared with 60 minutes before breakfast. Consolidating these data, conditions associated with better absorption, ordered from best to most impaired, are 60 minutes before breakfast, bedtime, 30 minutes before breakfast, and with breakfast; the fasting regimen also produced more consistent TSH values than the bedtime regimen. If taking LT4 1 hour before breakfast is not feasible, a bedtime regimen may be the next best choice.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine targeting of triiodothyronine or thyrotropin levels: There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with levothyroxine be targeted to achieve low-normal thyrotropin values or high-normal triiodothyronine values in patients with hypothyroidism who are overweight, those who have depression or dyslipidemia, or those who are athyreotic. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Supporting data include a 1-year study in which hypothyroid patients maintained low-normal or high-normal triiodothyronine (T3) had resultant T3 levels of 123 and 113 ng/dL with no decrement in cholesterol, BMI, or percentage body fat associated with the higher LT4, and a cross-over trial of 56 patients with primary hypothyroidism treated for 8-week periods with three doses of LT4 that achieved TSH values of 2.8, 1, and 0.3 mIU/L and free T3 values of 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 pg/mL, in which psychologic well-being, treatment satisfaction, and body weight did not change across the three different groups; although there was progressive lowering of total cholesterol with higher free T3 values, the significance of this reduction seemed to be due to lowering of cholesterol in the group that included many long-term patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and retrospective data found no significant weight changes after LT4 replacement or suppressive doses in postsurgical hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1b65e3ea]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although age specific TSH targets may be considered, especially in the context of high cardiovascular risk, this strategy is based on the findings of studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid people. However, patients with hypothyroidism need a higher concentration of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH concentration compared with euthyroid controls. Consequently, a hypothyroid patient receiving thyroid replacement therapy and a euthyroid patient with comparable TSH concentrations are not expected to have comparable circulating free thyroxine concentrations. The same is true of free triiodothyronine concentrations in patients who have had total thyroidectomy. Therefore, any extrapolations on the association between optimal TSH concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy based on studies in euthyroid patients should be treated with caution, as serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations (relevant to cardiovascular physiology) may differ significantly between the two groups.

Moreover, in primary studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid patients, and in the related meta-analyses and reviews, thyroid function testing was done only at baseline. The potential therefore exists for misclassification bias in all estimates to date as a result of established and anticipated changes in thyroid hormone production over the life course of a patient, as well as instances of transient thyroid dysfunction (such as non-thyroidal illness or following the hyperthyroid phase of a painless thyroiditis). A person classified as euthyroid at baseline might go on to develop hypothyroidism, overt or subclinical, whereas those classified as subclinically hypothyroid might be found to be euthyroid on follow-up thyroid function testing.

Similar limitations affect studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and risk of fracture, and whether variation in TSH concentration within normal limits may significantly affect the skeleton or whether any effect is insignificant in clinical terms (fracture risk remains unaffected) remains unclear. This is further challenged by evidence suggesting that free thyroxine concentrations are the main driver of the above clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore whether TSH concentration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and fractures in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. We treated TSH as a time varying covariate to account for variation in TSH concentration over time within individuals.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^472a8176]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

Combination LT4, LT3 treatment in primary hypothyroidism — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: In adults with primary hypothyroidism, 13 original RCTs were reviewed, with treatment durations ranging from 5 weeks to 1 year and the majority 6 months or shorter; females accounted for 80% or more of participants in specific trials; seven had a cross-over design and the rest a parallel design; all included trials had some level of blinding except for one study. Effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) varied: eight studies found no difference versus LT4 alone, two reported significantly higher TSH with combination therapy, and two reported significantly lower TSH, including suppression to 0.07 mIU/L in a highest dose combination group using a 5:1 ratio of LT4 to LT3. Health-related quality-of-life/mood results across 13 trials were heterogeneous, with two trials showing marked superiority of combination treatment on multiple measures, two showing superiority on a minority of measurements (including improvements at 3 months but not 12 months in one trial), and eight trials showing no statistically significant superiority over LT4.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^876095ca]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Until the situation is clarified all currently available treatment options should remain on the table and the focus should remain on facilitating the free choice of prescriptible treatment options rather than imposing new restrictions. The biochemically based reason for the rise in patient complaints has to be addressed, not a shift on to them of blame and burden of proof.

This invites a resume of the current state of affairs.

It appears that what we are witnessing constitutes an unprecedented historic change in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, driven by over-reliance on a single laboratory parameter TSH and supported by persuasive guidelines. This has resulted in a mass experiment in disease definition and a massive swing of the pendulum from a fear of drug-induced thyrotoxicosis to the new actuality of unresolved designation of hypothyroidism. All of this has occurred in a relatively short period of time without any epidemiological monitoring of the situation. Evidence has become ephemeral and many recommendations lag behind the changing demographic patterns addressing issues that are no longer of high priority as the pendulum has already moved in the opposite direction. In a rapidly changing medical environment, guidelines have emerged as a novel though often over-promoted driver of unprecedented influence and change. Treatment choices no longer rest primarily on the personal interaction between patient and doctor but have become a mass commodity, based on the increasing use of guidelines not as advisory but obligatory for result interpretation and subsequent treatment. Contrary to all proclaimed efforts towards a more personalised medicine, this has become a regulated consumer mass market as with many other situations. This is of little benefit to patients who will continue to complain, and with some justification, that the medical profession is not listening, thereby abandoning one of its primary functions in the doctor-patient relationship.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Excessive levothyroxine (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis) — harms and threshold: "The deleterious health effects of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis". Accordingly, "we recommend avoiding thyroid hormone excess and subnormal serum thyrotropin values, particularly thyrotropin values below 0.1 mIU/L, especially in older persons and postmenopausal women. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". Over-treatment is common; "In one study of older individuals taking LT4, 36% of patients over age 65 years had a subnormal serum TSH (233)". Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L", including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period". Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable", and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values".

Figure 1
Shows FT4 value against log(TSH) for (a) results for patients who have been treated with LT4. Where more than one result was available the median result in each year was applied and (b) Untreated patients who had a single diagnostic test result during the period. The ellipses are centred on median values and x, y based on 5%ile and 95%ile values for TSH and FT4.

The age distribution for the treated and untreated individuals was different, as shown in Figure 2a with treated patients being older than those not on LT4 treatment. Variation of TSH and FT4 in the two population was examined:by age.
Median TSH (Figure 2b) was much higher in the treated population and was relatively unchanged by age, while in the untreated population was lower and increased with age. The difference in TSH between treated and untreated was larger at younger ages and declined with age, to be less at older age,
Median FT4 (Figure 2c) increased noticeably with age in the treated population, while in the untreated it remained relatively constant. Thus the difference was smaller at younger ages but grew larger with age.

Figure 2
Differences between total treated (monitoring test) and untreated (screening test) populations (a) % total population by age group. (b) Median TSH plotted by age group for treated and untreated patients. (c) Median FT4 by age group.

We also applied looked at the relation between treated versus nontreated individuals by gender with an age differential of < 60 years old versus 60 years old or more.

The difference in median values for treated versus nontreated individuals were surprisingly both higher: FT4 by 10% and TSH by 17% with the differences remaining by sex and also in younger or older age groups (Table 1) except for TSH in older women where TSH was the same but FT4 was 15% higher in the treated group.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Levothyroxine use in the United States, 2008–2018… [^16f7532e]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The cohort included adults who newly filled levothyroxine prescriptions between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, and who had a thyrotropin level measured within 3 months prior to levothyroxine initiation. We excluded people with a history of thyroid surgery, thyroid cancer, or central hypothyroidism and pregnant women. We used descriptive statistics to characterize trends in thyrotropin levels and categories of thyroid function measured prior to levothyroxine initiation. Between 2008 and 2018, 110 842 patients newly initiated levothyroxine treatment. The median thyrotropin level at treatment initiation did not significantly change:

5. 8 mIU/L in 2008 to
5. 3 mIU/L in 2018. In a subset of 58 706 patients with thyrotropin and FT4 or T4 levels available, levothyroxine was initiated for overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and normal thyroid levels.

We found that levothyroxine treatment was commonly initiated for mildly increased thyrotropin levels, and this did not change significantly over time. Among patients for whom full thyroid function test results were available, 60% initiated levothyroxine for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and 30% for normal thyroid function, without significant change in these patterns over time. Frequent initiation of levothyroxine in these patients is at odds with evidence demonstrating no significant association of levothyroxine replacement with measures of health-related quality of life, thyroid-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, fatigue, or cognitive function. 3, 4 Our study has some limitations. The study included commercially insured patients, who may be more likely to use levothyroxine, and thus findings may not generalize to other populations. We could not assess symptoms or other potential compelling reasons for levothyroxine initiation.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Randomized controlled trials of LT4/LT3 versus LT4 alone — Table 7 — report designs, sample sizes, treatment durations, and end-of-study TSH differences. In an autoimmune, parallel, blinded study, 141 randomized (130 completed) over 15 weeks, end-of-study TSH favored combination therapy, "LT4/LT3 < LT4 (TSH significantly lower only in the 5:1 LT4/LT3 dose group)". Several blinded trials found no between-group TSH difference, including a cross-over study with 35 (33) over 5 weeks and a parallel, unblinded study with 36 (36) over 6 months reporting "NS". Other trials reported higher TSH with combination therapy, including a cross-over, blinded study with 28 (26) over 8 weeks showing "LT4/LT3 > LT4" and a parallel, blinded study with 697 (573) over "12 Months (outcomes assessed 3 and 12 months)" also showing "LT4/LT3 > LT4".

Patient satisfaction with levothyroxine therapy — measurement tools for symptoms, psychological well-being, treatment satisfaction, and preferences: of the established instruments used to measure hypothyroid symptoms, data are lacking regarding their sensitivity and specificity in the "everyday" clinical setting to recommend their routine clinical use, and further studies are needed to determine if and how to combine general psychological screening instruments, hypothyroidism-specific tools, and laboratory assessment of thyroid function to measure the impact of levothyroxine replacement therapy; a combination of general instruments, combined with hypothyroidism-specific tools, may be the most effective way to examine psychological well-being in the levothyroxine-treated population in the research setting.

Aim to maintain free T4 levels above the median value of the normal range.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

Mechanistic background — serum triiodothyronine (T3) homeostasis and tissue sourcing: Plasma T3 is the main, and perhaps the only, source of T3 for tissues that lack D2, and even in D2‑expressing tissues approximately 50% of intracellular T3 is estimated to originate from plasma; thus, if plasma T3 falls to low levels, thyroid hormone signaling would be expected to decrease systemically, although the minimum serum concentration that produces biologically important effects remains to be determined. Extrapolating rodent data to humans has a caveat because rats are skewed toward T3 with a ratio of about 6:1 compared with 14:1 in humans.

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.

They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.

In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.

In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted.

Partial loss of hair may be experienced by children in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule.

Laboratory Tests — Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d27c0757]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid hormone replacement therapies in hypothyroidism, revealing that combined T4 + T3 therapy and desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) offer distinct biochemical profiles compared to T4 monotherapy yet do not significantly impact a range of clinical outcomes. Notably, combined therapy does not alter TSH levels but significantly affects total T4 and T3 levels, suggesting specific biochemical changes without corresponding clinical benefits regarding lipid profile, cardiovascular risk markers, and quality of life measures. However, a significant improvement in mental health and well-being with combined therapy emerges as a potential benefit, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies. The observed high heterogeneity across studies underscores the complexity of thyroid hormone therapy and the importance of individual patient factors in treatment decisions, paving the way for more tailored and nuanced approaches to managing hypothyroidism.

Thyroid hormone metabolism — deiodinase effects on T3 indicate that deiodinase enzymes 1 and 2 convert thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and account for most circulating T3; altered activity of these enzymes in intercurrent illness results in the low T3 concentrations characteristic of the nonthyroidal illness syndrome; modification of deiodinase 1, 2, and 3 activity in patients on T4 replacement can lower circulating T3; increased activity of deiodinase enzyme 3 can reduce circulating T3 and can metabolize both T3 and T4.

### The history and future of treatment of hypothyroidism [^3fef06f6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement has been used for more than a century to treat hypothyroidism. Natural thyroid preparations (thyroid extract, desiccated thyroid, or thyroglobulin), which contain both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), were the first pharmacologic treatments available and dominated the market for the better part of the 20th century. Dosages were adjusted to resolve symptoms and to normalize the basal metabolic rate and/or serum protein-bound iodine level, but thyrotoxic adverse effects were not uncommon. Two major developments in the 1970s led to a transition in clinical practice: 1) The development of the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay led to the discovery that many patients were overtreated, resulting in a dramatic reduction in thyroid hormone replacement dosage, and 2) the identification of peripheral deiodinase-mediated T4-to-T3 conversion provided a physiologic means to justify l-thyroxine monotherapy, obviating concerns about inconsistencies with desiccated thyroid. Thereafter, l-thyroxine monotherapy at doses to normalize the serum TSH became the standard of care. Since then, a subgroup of thyroid hormone-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism despite normalization of the serum TSH has been identified. This has brought into question the inability of l-thyroxine monotherapy to universally normalize serum T3 levels. New research suggests mechanisms for the inadequacies of l-thyroxine monotherapy and highlights the possible role for personalized medicine based on deiodinase polymorphisms. Understanding the historical events that affected clinical practice trends provides invaluable insight into formulation of an approach to help all patients achieve clinical and biochemical euthyroidism.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^433da24a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results reveal that combined T4 + T3 therapy does not significantly alter TSH levels, yet it influences free T3 levels, aligning with findings from previous research. Our analysis also shows a notably lower total T4 and a higher total T3 with combined therapy. This supports that combined therapy improves T3 levels, which could help patients with issues in the conversion of T4 to T3 in the peripheral tissues. The variable impacts on metabolic parameters and quality of life, as noted in prior studies on T4 + T3 therapy, may be attributed to the subjective nature of quality-of-life assessments and differing metrics utilized across studies. Furthermore, our findings show that TSH and T3 levels change significantly with DTE. This suggests that natural formulations, which contain both T3 and T4, may have different biochemical but not clinical effects when compared to synthetic therapies. These observed discrepancies could stem from heterogeneity in patient populations, study designs, dosing regimens, and the sensitivity of assays used to measure thyroid hormone levels, highlighting the complexity and individual variability in thyroid hormone replacement therapy responses.

### Thyroxine replacement during super-ovulation for in vitro fertilization: a potential gap in management? [^3e2dbefb]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective is to report observed changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in two patients undergoing super-ovulation for IVF.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Private assisted reproduction practices.

Patient(S)

Two hypothyroid women taking thyroxine replacement therapy undergoing super-ovulation for IVF.

Intervention(S)

Laboratory records for TSH taken during ovulation induction cycles were retrieved retrospectively for six cycles and measured prospectively for one cycle each in both women.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

To document changes in thyroid status during super-ovulation.

Result(S)

Despite being euthyroid at the start of the super-ovulation cycle, both patients demonstrated a rise in TSH to hypothyroid levels during ovulation induction, even in the absence of ongoing pregnancy.

Conclusion(S)

High circulating E(2) during super-ovulation for IVF induces increased thyroxine-binding globulin binding of thyroxine. In women taking thyroxine replacement therapy, hypothyroidism develops during a super-ovulation cycle. Whether such acute biochemical hypothyroidism is a hindrance to ovum quality, fertilization, conception, or ongoing pregnancy and whether thyroxine dose adjustment during a super-ovulation cycle would improve IVF outcomes requires further study. These case studies identify a potential management gap in assisted reproduction for women taking thyroxine therapy.

Objective To compare TSH levels between patients who continued taking the same sourced generic levothyroxine product and those who switched. Design, Setting, and Participants. Because the latter strategy is logistically easier, the guidelines imply that prescribing generic levothyroxine may be associated with changes in thyroid hormone levels or dosages required. This guideline recommendation is at odds with the FDA position that approved generic levothyroxine products are expected to be interchangeable without the need for serum thyrotropin testing. 7, 8. Given these concerns, it is important to understand the implications of switching among different generic levothyroxine products for TSH levels. Accordingly, using national data from a large administrative claims database, we compared the effectiveness and safety of generic levothyroxine between patients who did and did not switch manufacturers.

Specifically, we examined the implications of switching among generic levothyroxine products for levels of TSH, the widely accepted laboratory test used to assess thyroid status. In addition, we excluded adults who filled other forms of thyroid replacement therapy — including thyroid extracts, or triiodothyronine therapy, such as liothyronine, thyroid desiccated or extracts, and the brands Cytomel, Armour Thyroid, or Nature-Throid — between 6 months before the index date and when the first TSH test result was obtained 6 weeks to 12 months after the index date. A baseline characteristic was considered balanced if the maximum standardized mean difference was less than 10%. Switchers were matched 1: 1 to nonswitchers using nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0. 2 of the SD of the logit of the propensity score.

Using this matched cohort, we then tested for differences between patients who continued taking the same sourced levothyroxine products vs those who switched using χ2 tests for categorical outcomes and an unpaired t test for continuous outcomes as our primary analysis method. This comparative effectiveness research study suggests that switching among generic levothyroxine products sourced from different manufacturers was not associated with differences in achieving a normal TSH level or with changes in TSH levels compared with continuing to take the same sourced levothyroxine. These results may reassure patients and clinicians that switching among generic levothyroxine products is unlikely to have substantial implications for treatment effects. The results conflict with the current expert guideline recommendation that warns patients and clinicians about possible consequences of switching among levothyroxine products for TSH levels.

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^b2cb9a43]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This has not been tested in a clinical trial.

Objective

Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter improves well-being compared with a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

Design

We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

Participants

Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 microg/d) with baseline serum TSH 0.1–4.8 mU/liter participated.

Interventions

Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-microg increments) in random order.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being (the primary endpoint) and hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

Results

Mean (± sem) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any of the instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function and no significant treatment preference.

Conclusions

Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life, despite the expected changes in serum TSH and markers of thyroid hormone action. These data do not support the suggestion that the target TSH range for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism should differ from the general laboratory range.

### Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists statement-replacement therapy for primary hypothyroidism: a brief guide for clinical practice [^ff65aacc]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism requires life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established safe and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

Methods

The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

Results

LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses. Combined therapy should be avoided in elderly patients or those with cardiac risk factors and in pregnancy.

Conclusion

LT4 therapy should be aimed at resolution of symptoms of hypothyroidism, normalization of serum TSH, and improvement of quality of life. In selected cases, the use of liquid LT4 formulations or combined LT4/LT3 treatment may be considered to improve adherence to treatment or patient well-being.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8fb5d6f3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

GH and thyroid — management around GH therapy and testing: We recommend that clinicians monitor euthyroid patients with GHD who begin GH therapy for the risk of developing CH, and if fT4 levels decrease below the reference range, these patients should begin L-T4 therapy; CH patients with GHD who are already receiving L-T4 may require increased L-T4 doses when they begin GH therapy to maintain fT4 levels within target ranges, and we suggest clinicians treat CH before performing GH stimulation testing because CH may impair the accurate diagnosis of GHD. Administering GH to adults with GHD causes variable changes in thyroid hormone levels — the most consistent effect being decreased fT4 levels; in patients with GHD, 36–47% of euthyroid patients and 16–18% of treated CH patients developed low fT4 levels within 3–6 months of starting GH therapy.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^8c47da83]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) — management and TRIAC therapy is described as limited to case reports, and most patients can be managed symptomatically with selective β-blockers; in cases erroneously treated as thyrotoxic, use of LT4 therapy requires supraphysiological dosing to make TRβ-dominant tissues "euthyroid", and LT4 can be combined with β-blockers to prevent TRα-related cardiac symptoms. Treatment must be individualized, adequate tests of TSH values are required to guide and monitor replacement, and the replacement therapy should be adjusted to the patient's symptoms and signs. Aside from the LT3 suppression test (Werner's test) used diagnostically to distinguish RTH from TSH-producing adenomas, LT3 is generally not considered part of therapy, though it has been employed in children with RTH affected by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Small case series indicate that TRIAC is effective in suppressing TSH with no evidence of cardiac toxicity, with one case involving a treatment duration of 3 years, but this drug is not currently available in the United States; hence treatment options are limited to LT4 coupled with cardio-selective β-blockers, and TRβ-mimetic analogs may represent a more targeted option.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^73204c7e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Using the observed historical narrower therapeutic range for an individual patient we note that the treatment targets may overlap for patients in a group. If that is true the general assumption that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits to routinely achieve a satisfactory outcome for each and every patient may be ill advised. We have refuted the applicability of treatment targets based on the consideration of the reference ranges in the healthy population, by demonstrating dissociations between FT3 and FT4, and FT3 and TSH in LT4-treated athyreotic patients, and documenting altered equilibria between the hormones on LT4, compared to the healthy state. Others have arrived at similar conclusions. In laboratory diagnostics, the high individuality of TSH and thyroid hormones has long been recognised since the pioneering work of Andersen and colleagues. However, this applies equally to the statistical analysis of associations involving thyroid parameters. Data clustering, be it in groups with similar properties or in subjects where multiple measurements are obtained over time, potentially masks the true relationship, abolishing the strong associations at the group level when the data are combined for analysis. This phenomenon, known as Simpson's paradox, is readily demonstrated with a fictitious random sample of two groups with a slightly shifted centre showing the same strong inverse correlation. Unlike the correct analysis by individual groups, a combined analysis of the total cohort artificially weakens the correlation (Fig. 2). The analytical distinction between the averaged versus the typical outcome is clinically relevant for all thyroid drug trials, independently of evidence class and study design, because doctors are naturally more interested in the latter.

Fig. 2
Demonstration of correlation bias by combining dissimilar groups. In randomly sampled groups showing the same strong inverse correlation (blue and red regression line) but slightly shifted centres, a combined analysis (black regression line) - unlike the correct analysis by individual groups - weakens the correlation. Distinguishing between averaged and typical outcomes is particularly important for parameters with known high individuality such as thyroid hormones

In a large retrospective longitudinal study, relying on a multilevel model and accounting for both within-subject and between-subject variation, symptomatic outcomes were associated with serum FT3 concentrations, and differed according to the placement of biochemical parameters within the reference range or noticeably beyond its limits in the case of TSH and FT4. Treatment-related displacement of the equilibria between thyroid parameters, wide variations in the biochemical treatment response, and individually adjusted dose requirement pose particular challenges for thyroid trials. Demonstration of averaged equivalency cannot therefore be a satisfactory analytical goal.

Recommendations

3.2.1 The monitoring of L-T 4 treatment should be based on periodic measurements of serum or plasma FT4 (or TT 4) and TSH concentrations. The blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected at least 4 hours after the last L-T 4 administration (1|⊕⊕○). We recommend maintaining TSH in the age-specific reference range (but to avoid undetectable TSH < 0.05 mU/L) and serum concentrations of TT 4 or FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference range (1|⊕⊕○). If necessary, the treatment should be adjusted according to the hormone concentrations measured, but decreases in LT4 dose should not be based on a single high FT4 concentration during treatment (1|⊕⊕○). Clinicians should be familiar with the reference ranges for the methods used by the laboratory carrying out the tests (1|⊕○○).

3.2.2 We recommend performing the first follow-up examination 1 to 2 weeks after the start of L-T 4 treatment, with intense follow-up over the first year of life (every 2 weeks until TSH levels are completely normalized and every 1 to 3 months thereafter, until the age of 12 months). Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months), with regular evaluations every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. Measurements should be performed at more frequent intervals if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained, and 4 to 6 weeks after any change in L-T 4 dose or L-T 4 formulation (eg, switch from brand to generic L-T 4) (1|⊕○○).

3.2.3 The incidence of adverse events during L-T 4 treatment is very low. The careful monitoring of thyroid hormone parameters, during both initial and maintenance treatment, is recommended to minimize the risk (1|⊕○○).

3.2.4 In children with pre-existing cardiac insufficiency, we suggest introducing L-T 4 at 50% of the target replacement dose and increasing this in accordance with FT4 levels after 2 weeks (2|⊕○○).
