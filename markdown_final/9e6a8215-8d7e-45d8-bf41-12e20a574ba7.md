## Question

Can you administer opioids to a pt that has consumed alchahol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether opioids can be administered to a patient who has consumed alcohol, and if so, under what circumstances and with what precautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic interaction between opioids and alcohol and its clinical consequences. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and regulatory labeling say about concurrent use. Next, I will examine exceptions such as acute pain management, alcohol withdrawal with co-occurring opioid use disorder, and perioperative scenarios. After that, I need to outline risk stratification and mitigation strategies, including monitoring, naloxone, and drug testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and state a clear bottom line with caveats and documentation requirements.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and clinical risk. Alcohol and opioids are both central nervous system depressants. When combined, they produce additive or synergistic respiratory depression, sedation, and risk of coma or death, and this risk is dose dependent and unpredictable across individuals, which is why multiple FDA labels carry boxed warnings about concomitant use with alcohol or other CNS depressants [^115W5F6Q] [^11685rX5] [^113xuyY9] [^113EB61F] [^111wNnMF] [^111Q6LeV]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of public health impact; CDC analyses show alcohol involvement in roughly one fifth of prescription opioid–related emergency department visits and deaths, underscoring the real-world lethality of this combination [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm what guidelines say before making a blanket rule. The CDC 2022 guideline advises clinicians to ask about alcohol use, counsel on overdose risk when opioids are combined with alcohol, and offer naloxone when risk factors are present, while avoiding opioids when possible in patients with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing and exercising great caution with sedative co-use, which is mechanistically analogous to alcohol risk [^116HYfv9]. ASAM guidance similarly emphasizes that concomitant alcohol or sedative use increases the risk of serious adverse effects with methadone or buprenorphine, and that patients with active alcohol or sedative use disorders may require more intensive monitoring or a higher level of care, but treatment for opioid use disorder should not be withheld solely due to alcohol use [^111GFJKH] [^1143PETW] [^111q2quV]. I should also double-check specialty guidance; pain guidelines consistently warn about greatly increased risks when opioids are combined with alcohol and recommend structured risk mitigation if opioids are used at all in such patients [^116DPbEU].

> Now, I will examine acute pain scenarios where alcohol is on board. Initially, I thought "never administer opioids if alcohol has been consumed", but wait, that is too absolute; in practice, clinicians may need to treat severe acute pain even when a patient is intoxicated, albeit with extreme caution and only if benefits clearly outweigh risks and monitoring is available [^notfound]. I should confirm best practices: use the lowest effective opioid dose, avoid other sedatives, employ continuous pulse oximetry, and have naloxone readily available; many ED policies explicitly acknowledge increased risk with alcohol yet allow carefully titrated opioids for severe pain with close monitoring, and FDA labeling for multiple opioids reiterates that concomitant alcohol increases overdose risk, necessitating conservative dosing and vigilant observation [^115W5F6Q] [^11685rX5] [^113xuyY9]. Let me reconsider the threshold; if the patient is severely intoxicated, non-opioid multimodal analgesia should be prioritized and opioids deferred or withheld until sobriety and safer monitoring can be ensured, documenting the risk–benefit rationale if treatment proceeds [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the special case of alcohol withdrawal with co-occurring opioid use disorder. ASAM recommends stabilizing opioid use disorder with methadone or buprenorphine while simultaneously treating alcohol withdrawal, precisely because untreated opioid use disorder carries high mortality and because agonist therapy may reduce alcohol-related acute events; however, benzodiazepines used for withdrawal must be dosed cautiously due to additive respiratory depression risk with opioids, and patients often require monitored settings for safety [^111BfJQX] [^111GFJKH] [^11218gVx]. Hold on, I should verify the monitoring level; ASAM advises that patients on opioid agonist therapy who develop alcohol withdrawal should be managed in a hospital or similarly resourced setting when risk is elevated, reflecting the need for continuous observation and rapid intervention if respiratory depression occurs [^111GFJKH].

> I will now examine perioperative and procedural contexts. Patients with unhealthy alcohol use may have complex pain needs, hyperalgesia, and cross-tolerance to opioids, and some anticipate using alcohol to manage postoperative pain, which elevates overdose risk; preoperative screening for alcohol use and counseling to avoid alcohol with opioids are prudent, and if opioids are required, use the lowest effective dose with enhanced monitoring and naloxone provision when indicated [^1114D4g6] [^112RCyrt] [^117VLbzV]. But wait, what if the patient is on naltrexone for alcohol use disorder; perioperative naltrexone management is controversial and most guidance favors holding naltrexone preoperatively to allow effective analgesia, though evidence is limited and decisions should balance relapse risk and pain control with multidisciplinary input [^113F7dKx] [^117KZA2T].

> Let me think about risk stratification and mitigation before any opioid is considered in someone who uses alcohol. I should confirm that we screen for alcohol use frequency and quantity, assess for alcohol use disorder, and document prior overdoses, respiratory comorbidities, and concurrent sedatives; validated tools and single-item screens can expedite this, and PDMP checks plus urine drug testing, including alcohol biomarkers when appropriate, help verify risk and guide monitoring frequency [^117VLbzV] [^114qvrhb] [^113a63x1]. I need to ensure we co-prescribe naloxone and train caregivers, intensify follow-up, and consider a signed treatment agreement with clear alcohol abstinence expectations during opioid therapy; these steps align with CDC and pain society guidance for high-risk patients, including those with alcohol exposure [^117VLbzV] [^116DPbEU] [^113fVDfe].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-specific contraindications and interactions. Certain opioids have explicit label warnings against any alcohol co-ingestion due to dose-dumping or unpredictable pharmacokinetics, such as extended-release morphine (Avinza) and oxymorphone, where alcohol can markedly increase plasma levels and precipitate fatal overdose; in these cases, the balance shifts toward avoidance unless a compelling rationale exists with robust safeguards [^112diG5e] [^115W5F6Q] [^11233sW8]. I should double-check that we communicate these risks clearly and document patient counseling, as FDA labeling for multiple opioids emphasizes that concurrent alcohol use increases the risks of misuse, overdose, and death even at therapeutic doses [^11685rX5] [^113xuyY9] [^111wNnMF] [^111Q6LeV].

> Next, I should review alternatives and adjuncts to minimize opioid exposure when alcohol use is present. Non-opioid multimodal regimens, regional anesthesia when feasible, and psychosocial support for alcohol use disorder should be prioritized. If chronic pain coexists, consider agents like gabapentinoids that may also reduce alcohol cravings, while avoiding sedative co-use and carefully screening for hepatic injury risk if acetaminophen or NSAIDs are contemplated in heavy drinkers [^1167EhT3] [^114dXQZ3] [^115CoXL5]. Let me verify acetaminophen safety; although therapeutic doses for short courses have not shown hepatotoxicity in controlled detoxification settings, chronic alcohol use increases risk, so dose limits and clinical judgment are essential, and alternatives should be favored when possible [^117GYLVS].

> I should confirm the bottom line and ensure it is clinically actionable. In general, concurrent administration of opioids with alcohol should be avoided due to the high risk of respiratory depression, overdose, and death; if opioids are absolutely necessary for severe acute pain or for stabilizing opioid use disorder during alcohol withdrawal, they should be given only with the lowest effective dose, continuous monitoring, naloxone provision, and explicit alcohol abstinence counseling, ideally in a supervised setting when risk is high, and this approach should be documented with a clear risk–benefit rationale [^117VLbzV] [^111GFJKH] [^1143PETW]. Hold on, I should verify that we also plan for longitudinal care; patients with co-occurring alcohol and opioid issues benefit from integrated treatment, and evidence suggests that buprenorphine or methadone treatment for OUD is associated with fewer alcohol-related acute events, reinforcing the value of stabilizing OUD rather than withholding it due to alcohol use [^11218gVx] [^111q2quV].

---

In general, **opioids should not be administered to patients who have consumed alcohol** due to the high risk of **respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose** [^117VLbzV] [^111yVunS]. If opioids are absolutely necessary, use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring and ensure alcohol has been avoided for at least several hours. Always co-prescribe naloxone and counsel patients on the risks of mixing opioids with alcohol [^113fVDfe].

---

## Pharmacological interactions between opioids and alcohol

Opioids and alcohol both depress the CNS, and their combination produces **additive or synergistic effects** that markedly increase the risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose [^111yVunS]. Key interactions include:

- **Respiratory depression**: Combined CNS depression can cause life-threatening hypoventilation or apnea [^115W5F6Q].

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Additive sedation impairs alertness, coordination, and judgment, increasing accident risk [^115ueToi].

- **Overdose risk**: Co-use significantly increases overdose risk, including fatal outcomes [^117VLbzV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines uniformly advise against **opioid–alcohol co-use**:

- **CDC guideline**: Avoid prescribing opioids with alcohol; if unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and provide naloxone [^117VLbzV] [^116HYfv9].

- **FDA warnings**: Multiple opioid labels warn of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death with alcohol [^115W5F6Q] [^113xuyY9].

- **ASAM**: Patients using alcohol or sedatives need more intensive monitoring; consider higher levels of care [^1143PETW] [^113Zg8r9].

---

## Risks and complications of co-administration

Co-administration of opioids and alcohol carries **significant risks**:

| **Risk** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory depression | Life-threatening hypoventilation or apnea [^115W5F6Q] |
| Sedation and cognitive impairment | Increased accident and injury risk [^115ueToi] |
| Overdose | Higher risk of fatal overdose [^117VLbzV] |
| Hepatic impairment | Alcohol-related liver disease increases opioid toxicity risk [^notfound] |
| Gastrointestinal complications | Higher risk of GI bleeding and ulcers [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or avoidance

Certain scenarios require **particular caution or avoidance**:

- **Chronic alcohol use**: Increases risk of hepatic impairment and opioid toxicity [^113fVDfe].

- **Alcohol use disorder**: Higher risk of misuse, overdose, and adverse outcomes [^117VLbzV].

- **Perioperative settings**: Alcohol use increases perioperative morbidity and complicates pain management [^117KZA2T].

---

## Clinical scenarios where opioids may be considered

In select cases, opioids may be considered with **strict precautions**:

- **Acute pain management**: Use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and ensure alcohol has been avoided for several hours.

- **Alcohol withdrawal**: Stabilize opioid use disorder concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management [^111BfJQX].

- **Chronic pain with alcohol use disorder**: Use structured opioid therapy with close monitoring, written agreements, and frequent reassessment [^112UFpWb].

---

## Precautionary measures and monitoring strategies

When opioids are necessary in patients who have consumed alcohol, implement the following:

- **Risk assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. Opioid Risk Tool, COMM) to stratify risk [^1139jyM5].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Start low and titrate cautiously [^notfound].

- **Close monitoring**: Frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring for sedation, respiratory depression, and misuse [^113fVDfe].

- **Naloxone provision**: Co-prescribe naloxone and train patients and caregivers [^113fVDfe].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on risks of opioid–alcohol co-use and safe storage/disposal [^115ueToi].

---

## Alternative pain management strategies

Given the risks, consider **non-opioid alternatives**:

- **Acetaminophen and NSAIDs**: First-line for mild to moderate pain; use cautiously in hepatic disease [^1167EhT3].

- **Gabapentinoids**: Effective for neuropathic pain and may reduce alcohol cravings [^115CoXL5].

- **Non-pharmacologic therapies**: Physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions [^112RCyrt].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Opioids should generally be **avoided in patients who have consumed alcohol** because of the high risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose. If opioids are necessary, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, ensure alcohol has been avoided for several hours, and co-prescribe naloxone. Prefer non-opioid strategies when feasible, and tailor treatment to patient risk and clinical context [^117VLbzV] [^113fVDfe].

### Naltrexone [^1174ToBb]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Naltrexone implants must be administered by a physician.

To prevent occurrence of an acute abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical abstinence syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, must be opioid-free for a minimum of 7–10 days before starting Naltrexone Implant treatment. Since the absence of an opioid drug in the urine is often not sufficient proof that a patient is opioid-free, a naloxone challenge test should be employed if the prescribing physician feels there is a risk of precipitating a withdrawal reaction following administration of Naltrexone Implants. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with Naltrexone Implants should be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with Naltrexone Implants. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or dependence on opioids.

The aluminum (back) part of the blister packs should be wiped with sterile 70% isopropyl alcohol pads prior to opening. Implants should be handled via aseptic technique and should be used immediately.

The recommended dose of Naltrexone implants is 1200mg delivered subcutaneously every 10–12 weeks.

Reemergence of cravings should be screened and may be used as a gauge for the need for re-implantation schedule.

Healthcare providers should tailor the length of treatment to individual patients. Naltrexone has been administered to patients who are alcohol dependent for 6 months to 1 year with no additional safety concerns. Many scientists claim that treatment duration should last at least 1 year since this is the amount of time it can take to change the brain's addiction pathways.

Treatment with Naltrexone should be part of a psychological and psychosocial program.

Treatment alternatives for chronic pain in patients with alcohol use disorders

Treatment alternatives for chronic nociceptive pain

Acetaminophen

Chronic alcohol use is an independent risk factor for mortality in acetaminophen toxicity. New recommendations from the United States Food and Drug Administration have reduced the maximum acetaminophen dose for all users from 4 to 3.2 g/day, extra caution remains warranted in heavy drinkers.

Reports have suggested that even therapeutic doses of acetaminophen may be associated with hepatic failure and death in patients with alcohol dependence.–The time of highest risk for hepatic injury is expected immediately after discontinuation of alcohol intake when the production of N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone imine, the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, is highest as cytochrome P450 2E1 enzymes remain induced by alcohol for a few days following cassation of chronic exposure. This is also a period when concentrations of glutathione, an antioxidant that converts acetaminophen into a harmless substance, remain depleted in chronic alcohol users. Moreover, concurrent intoxication with alcohol decreases the potential for liver injury by acetaminophen because of competitive inhibition of acetaminophen metabolism by ethanol.

A systematic review and meta-analysis sought to quantify the effect of therapeutic doses of acetaminophen on serum ALT levels in patients who consumed alcohol. This meta-analysis included a total of five randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials comparing therapeutic doses of acetaminophen (2–4 g/day, duration of 2–10 days with placebo). Four trials enrolling heavy alcohol users who were admitted to a detoxification center and began acetaminophen within 24 hours of their last drink, one trial enrolled moderate drinkers who continued their normal drinking pattern during the study. The meta-analysis concluded that patients who received acetaminophen in doses up to 4 g/day did not have elevation of their ALT levels on day 4, compared to those who received placebo. The study by Heard et alincluded in that meta-analysis examined duration of acetaminophen of 10 days and measured ALT on both day 4 and 11 of the study. On day 11, the mean change in ALT was increased in patients receiving acetaminophen over those receiving placebo. This change was not statistically significant, nor were any subjects symptomatic nor meet predefined criteria for hepatotoxicity or liver failure. Similar evidence is not yet available for long-term use of acetaminophen in patients who continue to abuse alcohol.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide oral solution (hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide) [^113xuyY9]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE- THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; MEDICATION ERRORS; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; INTERACTION WITH ALCOHOL; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient's risk before prescribing and monitor closely for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or when used in patients at higher risk. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. (5.2)
Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. (2,1, 5.5)
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Avoid the use of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide in patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. (5.7, 7.2, 7.3)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid the use of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol. (5.8, 7.4)
Instruct patients not to consume alcohol or any products containing alcohol while taking hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide because co-ingestion can result in fatal plasma hydrocodone levels. (5.8, 7.1)
Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of HYCODAN during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated. If HYCODAN is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. (5.13, 8.1)

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^116DqiS4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid including products containing Oxycodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets

Abuse of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death.

Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^117VLbzV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonprescribed drugs (e.g. heroin, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine) and alcohol are listed as contributory factors on a substantial proportion of death certificates for prescription opioid–involved overdose deaths. Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use. Single screening questions can be used. For example, the question "How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?" (with an answer of one or more considered positive) was found in a primary care setting to be 100% sensitive and 73.5% specific for the detection of a drug use disorder compared with a standardized diagnostic interview. Validated screening tools, such as the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST); the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use Tool (TAPS); and the three-question version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), also can be used. Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose. Clinicians should also provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see Recommendation 12).

If clinicians consider prescribing opioid therapy for chronic pain to patients with substance use disorders, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients; carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks; and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan, such as offering naloxone (see Offering Naloxone to Patients) and increasing frequency of monitoring (see Recommendation 7) when opioids are prescribed. Clinicians should communicate with patients' substance use disorder treatment providers if opioids are prescribed. Although substance use disorders can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 12, Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder for additional considerations.)

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^112zj4eM]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Overdose — results from use of an excessive amount of a drug and can lead to serious injury or death, with opioids causing overdose by interrupting the body's natural drive to breathe; highly potent opioids such as fentanyl are more likely to cause an overdose, particularly when combined with other sedating substances and respiratory depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115ueToi]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. Review considerations related to access to care because of the clinical oversight needed to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments for pain.
Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long-term use and that complete elimination of pain is unlikely.
Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when pain is not eliminated.
Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major obligations at work, school, or home.
Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g. a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) is usually needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are taken regularly. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided.
If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks for taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.
Discuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated, when dosages are increased, or when other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently.
Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.
Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e. not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).
Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed drugs such as heroin, or other opioids.
Discuss risks for household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused opioids.
Discuss the importance of periodic reassessment to ensure that opioids are helping to meet patient goals and, if opioids are not effective or are harmful, to allow opportunities for consideration of opioid tapering and dosage reduction or discontinuation and of additional nonpharmacologic or nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options.
Discuss expectations for clinician and patient responsibilities to mitigate risks of opioid therapy and planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10).
Consider whether cognitive status might interfere with management of opioid therapy and, if so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly comanage medication therapy. Discuss the importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver, as appropriate.

### Beliefs about perioperative opioid and alcohol use among elective surgical patients who report unhealthy drinking: a qualitative study [^114UumP2]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors

Some individuals held high-risk beliefs and intentions regarding using prescribed opioids for acute surgical pain management including positive anticipation of pain relief and psychological effects. For example, some participants described positive anticipation of opioid access, and saw surgery as an "opportunity" to use opioids, despite the risk of relapse:

"I'm actually looking forward to some good pain pills. You know, after the surgery. If I'm in pain, I'll make sure I get something. And if they give me some to take home, because I have pain and discomfort, I will take them. And I'll take them as long as I have pain and discomfort. And I think I can manage it, you know. Because I don't wanna be re-addicted to it".

Other participants looked forward to using opioids after surgery and reported positive expectations of opioids related to psychological effects:

" Well, you're in pain and you take these oxy [oxycodone] and it's like you sit there for 5 minutes or less and all of a sudden it just washes over you and you're in this place. Well, you're not wasted or anything. You just feel happier. You feel stupider, ya know… "

Some participants report positive psychological and pain management experiences with opioids that led to dependence symptoms and having to slowly wean off:

"There's something about opioids that increased my level of focus… and boy I can get a lot done when I'm on those. When I'm on opioids, I feel they take the place of the alcohol but they have like a different… different reaction or a different feeling. The first time I had oxycodone, I hated it. But then I got used to them. And then you need more to get the same effect and what I do is I always cut myself back and I'm only taking half a tablet or whatever because I want them to last… The last time I had a couple of refills and every time you get a refill they cut down the number that you get… and so they kind of wean you off it".

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride [^115W5F6Q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)

Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program and to counsel patients and caregivers on serious risks, safe use, and the importance of reading the Medication Guide with each prescription [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Interaction with Alcohol

Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF OXYMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient's risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxymorphone. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7)
Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery. (5.4)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.5)
Instruct patients not to consume alcohol or any product containing alcohol while taking oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets because co-ingestion can result in fatal plasma oxymorphone levels. (5.3)

Buprenorphine — indications, tapering guidance, contraindications, cautions, interactions, and regulatory warnings: Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist available in a variety of formulations and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, and it is also an effective treatment for opioid withdrawal with efficacy similar to methadone and superior to lofexidine or clonidine in opioid withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If tapering is chosen, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and insufficient evidence is available on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose; one trial found that longer courses of buprenorphine with gradual tapering were superior to rapid tapering for withdrawal. Buprenorphine is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any component of the formulation and patients with severe liver impairment are not good candidates for office-based treatment, while patients with hepatitis C infection who do not have severe liver impairment may be considered for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine should be used with caution for patients with current or past hepatic dysfunction, noting a direct comparison with methadone found no difference in incidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver damage during the initial 6 months in either treatment groups and that monitoring liver enzymes may be considered, and caution also applies to patients who, at present, have an alcohol use or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and to those with hypovolemia, severe cardiovascular disease, or taking drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects because buprenorphine may cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Significant interactions include that alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressive effect of buprenorphine and that buprenorphine is metabolized to nor-buprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4, so concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored and may require dose reduction of one or both agents. In 2016, based on literature reviews and reported adverse events, the FDA required the addition of warnings on all opioid product labels, including methadone and buprenorphine.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^114dXQZ3]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This paper provides an overview of research, guidelines, and clinical considerations for the use of medications for chronic pain in the management of patients with an alcohol use disorder. A review of the literature identified randomized controlled trials, epidemiological cohort studies, consensus guidelines, and one systematic review and meta-analysis. Where gaps in the literature existed, clinical experience of the authors is included. Use of nonopioid medications should be given priority and may offer a more favorable risk profile as well as benefits beyond pain management, such as improvement in anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Pregabalin and gabapentin have additional benefits to decrease alcohol cravings or time to relapse after a period of abstinence from alcohol. Drug interactions between selected analgesics and alcohol, disulfiram, or naltrexone require careful consideration.

### Beliefs about perioperative opioid and alcohol use among elective surgical patients who report unhealthy drinking: a qualitative study [^1114D4g6]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Individuals with unhealthy alcohol use (defined as > 2 drinks/day on average) prior to surgery experience increased risk of postoperative complications and may have more complex pain management needs. They can experience alcohol-induced hyperalgesia particularly if they withdraw from alcohol in the context of surgical preparation or recovery. Individuals with unhealthy alcohol use can also experience cross-tolerance to opioid-based pain medications after surgery. Furthermore, the increased likelihood of postoperative complications can increase and prolong postoperative pain and use of prescribed opioids. All of these factors highlight the complex pain management needs of surgical patients who also consume alcohol.

Individuals with unhealthy alcohol use are more vulnerable to over-using and misusing opioids commonly prescribed for surgical pain. In addition, those with unhealthy alcohol and drug use are more likely to die from an overdose in the 30 days after surgical discharge. Alcohol and opioid co-use increase respiratory depression and risk of mortality beyond what would be observed with the use of either drug class alone.

Importantly, alcohol itself is a potent analgesic, comparable to morphine for acute pain. A blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% induces a moderate to large reduction in pain intensity, with increasing analgesic effects in a dose-dependent fashion. As many as one in four individuals with pain conditions report using alcohol to manage pain. While drinking alcohol reduces pain in the short-term, long-term alcohol use is linked to higher levels of pain and physical impairment. The strong association between unhealthy alcohol use and chronic pain is well-established and attributed to complex biopsychosocial pathways. To date, the possibility that surgical patients may use alcohol to manage acute surgical pain has not been explored.

Unhealthy alcohol use complicates perioperative pain management and opioid prescribing. Nevertheless, very little research has investigated patient's perceptions regarding co-use of alcohol and opioids to manage pain during the perioperative period. The goal of this descriptive qualitative study was thus to explore beliefs, intentions and behaviors related to opioid and alcohol use and co-use for pain management before and after surgery. An improved understanding of these topics could inform the development of interventions to address patients' unhealthy alcohol use, opioid misuse, addiction-related risks, and pain management needs following surgery while also generating hypotheses for future research with this vulnerable group.

### Association of opioid use disorder treatment with alcohol-related acute events [^113u1XfM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are opioid use disorder (OUD) medications associated with alcohol-related poisonings, falls, and injuries in persons with OUD and co-occurring alcohol use?

Findings

This case-control cohort study of 13 335 individuals with OUD from a large, nationally representative data set found that patients prescribed OUD medication had significant reductions in alcohol-related acute events.

Meaning

The use of OUD medication in opioid-dependent patients with co-occurring alcohol use may hold promise in reducing alcohol-related acute events, but more investigation is needed.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111GFJKH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression, and patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines may be given but should be used with caution and only in facilities with close monitoring, and patients receiving opioid agonist therapy with concomitant alcohol withdrawal should be admitted and managed in a hospital setting or other setting with the resources to manage increased risk of respiratory depression and other complications. Patients who are using sedative-hypnotic medication are at higher risk of major complications and may exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and require dose adjustment, and these patients should be monitored closely.

### Managing co-occurring substance use and pain disorders [^111LQSQy]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The safest pain treatment strategy for an individual at risk or recovering from addiction is a nonopioid and benzodiazepine-free approach. If an opioid treatment is necessary, the extent of the risk can be stratified by the use of a biopsychosocial assessment and opioid screening tools. Individuals at high risk should have the greatest amount of structure and monitoring. A written informed consent and treatment agreement can provide a framework for the patient and the patient's family, as well as the clinician. The structure of treatment should specify only that one prescribing physician will write a limited supply of opioids, without refills, until the analgesic efficacy, adverse events, and goals for functional restoration can be assessed. An additional recommendation is that prescriptions should be filled at the same pharmacy with no refill by phone or opportunity for replacement because of loss, damage, or stolen medications. Additionally, random urine drug screens and PDMP reports obtained will help determine if the patient is taking other substances, as well as monitor the patient's medication use patterns. It is important to assess for risk factors in treating chronic pain with opioids; clinicians need to have a realistic appreciation of the resources available to them and the types of patients that can be managed in their practice. Chronic pain treatment with opioids should not be undertaken in patients who are currently addicted to illicit substances or alcohol. With the support of family and friends, ideally the patient can be motivated to participate in an intensive substance abuse treatment. In patients without an immediate risk, precautionary steps should be taken when prescribing opioids. Clinicians and patients need to review the risk factors for opioid-related problems including younger age, benzodiazepine use, and comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, and heavy smoking. Both the provider and the patient need a personal investment in the treatment plan and protocol to increase the safety of opioid treatment. New medications and treatment monitoring are being developed to provide maximal relief for the patient while protecting the public health. The optimal ingredients for safe opioid treatment include a strong provider-patient relationship and clinician training in the assessment and treatment of addiction and pain.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112FgsAs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Concomitant use of alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with opioids may contribute to respiratory depression. Patients with significant co-occurring substance use disorders, especially severe alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, may require a higher level of care.

A tobacco use query and counseling on cessation of tobacco products should be completed routinely for all patients, including those who present for evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder.

An assessment of social and environmental factors should be conducted (as outlined in the ASAM Standards) to identify facilitators and barriers to addiction treatment, and specifically to pharmacotherapy. Before a decision is made to initiate a course of pharmacotherapy for the patient with opioid use disorder, the patient should receive a multidimensional assessment in fidelity with The ASAM Criteria: Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance-Related, and Co-Occuring Conditions (the "ASAM Criteria"). Addiction should be considered a bio-psycho-social-spiritual illness, for which the use of medication(s) is but only one component of overall treatment.

Diagnosis Recommendations

Other clinicians may diagnose opioid use disorder, but confirmation of the diagnosis by the provider with prescribing authority, and who recommends medication use, must be obtained before pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder commences.

Opioid use disorder is primarily diagnosed on the basis of the history provided by the patient and a comprehensive assessment that includes a physical examination.

Validated clinical scales that measure withdrawal symptoms, for example, the Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS), the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), may be used to assist in the evaluation of patients with opioid use disorder.

Urine drug testing during the comprehensive assessment process, and frequently during treatment, is recommended. The frequency of drug testing is determined by a number of factors including the stability of the patient, the type of treatment, and the treatment setting.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use and use validated tools or consult with behavioral specialists to screen for and assess mental health and substance use disorders.
When considering initiating long-term opioid therapy, clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression and other mental health conditions is optimized, consulting with behavioral health specialists when needed.
Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients at increased risk for overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use disorder, patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients taking higher dosages of opioids (e.g. ≥ 50 MME/day), patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11), and patients at risk for returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g. patients undergoing tapering or recently released from prison).
Practices should educate patients on overdose prevention and naloxone use and offer to provide education to members of their households.
Naloxone coprescribing can be facilitated by clinics or practices with resources to provide naloxone training, by collaborative practice models with pharmacists, or through statewide protocols or standing orders for naloxone at pharmacies.
Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care and emergency department settings can be found through Prescribe to Prevent at. Additional resources are at.
In part because of concerns about cost of naloxone and access for some patients and reports that purchasing of naloxone has in some cases been required to fill opioid prescriptions, including for patients without a way to afford naloxone, this recommendation specifies that naloxone should be offered to patients. To that end, clinicians, health systems, and payers can work to ensure patients can obtain naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment.
Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep-disordered breathing when possible to minimize risk for respiratory depression.
When making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy, clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks. For pregnant persons already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if tapering is being considered because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5).
For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 12).
Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and for patients aged ≥ 65 years. Clinicians should implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid therapy among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk assessment for falls, and patient monitoring for cognitive impairment.
For patients with jobs that involve potentially hazardous tasks and who are receiving opioids or other medications that can negatively affect sleep, cognition, balance, or coordination, clinicians should assess patients' abilities to safely perform the potentially hazardous tasks (e.g. driving, use of heavy equipment, climbing ladders, working at heights or around moving machinery, or working with high-voltage equipment).
Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose.
Clinicians should provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients are provided or receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see Recommendation 12).
Although substance use disorders can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 12, Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder for additional considerations specific to these patients.)
If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain for patients with substance use disorder, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone [see Offering Naloxone to Patients] and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).
If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use disorder and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and to discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids.
If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with previous opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1151m45G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal

The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone hydrochloride and have lasted for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes including confusion, somnolence and visual hallucinations have occurred. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have required intravenous fluid administration. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

### Morphine sulfate (Mitigo) [^114pa19X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

MITIGO®contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, MITIGO®exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed MITIGO®. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused

or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing MITIGO®, and monitor all patients receiving MITIGO®for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for

these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as MITIGO®but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of MITIGO®along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing MITIGO®. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity.

### Oliceridine (Olinvyk) [^113EB61F]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of OLINVYK abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oliceridine, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use OLINVYK in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

OLINVYK, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Risk Specific to Abuse of OLINVYK

Abuse of OLINVYK injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OLINVYK with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.

Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^117JPGDc]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Current options

Medications with three mechanisms are currently approved for the treatment of alcohol addiction by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The oldest, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram, remains most widely used. Its mechanism of action is peripheral, and cannot alleviate craving or other subjective states associated with alcoholism. Its use is associated with low compliance, and does not have support for significant efficacy unless administered under supervision. Disulfiram continues to have a place in clinical practice when sobriety needs to be ensured for some time, for instance to diagnose psychiatric co-morbidity. It is otherwise of limited interest for the present discussion.

Proof-of-principle for a neuropharmacological intervention in alcohol addiction was first provided by the mu-preferring opioid antagonist naltrexone –. Opioid peptides with activity at mu-receptors are released by alcohol intake, and contribute to alcohol reward –. Naltrexone is thought to interfere with this cascade. The overall effect size of naltrexone is modest, but this represents an average of a heterogeneous response, that varies strongly as a function of individual patient characteristics. Among these characteristics, predictors of clinical response include a family history of alcohol problems, early onset of problem drinking, being male, experiencing strong alcohol reward-related memories or cravings, and complying with treatment. The role of compliance can be viewed in light of extensive empirical data in support of the notion that opioid transmission plays a key role for the "liking" of natural rewards. Based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that naltrexone has a potential to attenuate healthy rewards, and that this limits the incentive to seek and comply with this treatment. A depot formulation of naltrexone was developed to improve compliance, but high cost limits its use. Another opioid antagonist approved for alcoholism treatment in Europe, nalmefene, shares its main mechanism of action with naltrexone, making major differences in clinical profile unlikely.

### A step forward in the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence… [^1132raqC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dr. Sara Roach: Welcome to "Q&A with FDA, " from the FDA's Division of Drug Information where we aim to answer some of the most frequently asked questions that we've received from the public. I'm Dr. Sara Roach, and today's topic is the recent first generic approval to Vivitrol, a one-month extended-release injectable naltrexone that is used to help people recovering from opioid or alcohol dependence. Dr. Roach: These numbers are quite significant, so I'm glad we're discussing this important public health issue. Could you tell me more about the FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Dr. Sokolowska: For most patients treated with medication for alcohol use disorder, the decision to begin oral versus injectable naltrexone is based on patient's preference, but injectable naltrexone may be more effective in ensuring adherence. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder has been focused on altering the reinforcing effects of alcohol use.

Naltrexone is available as an oral medication but also as the extended-release injectable product, Vivitrol, which has been approved since 2006. Dr. Roach: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with the long-acting naltrexone injectable product. In addition, this medication is approved for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification, and should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. Dr. Sokolowska: Yes, it's important because naltrexone is a treatment option for either disorder and is long acting. And by virtue of increasing the availability of generic drugs, it helps to create competition in the marketplace, which then helps to make treatment more affordable, increasing access to healthcare for more patients.

Once-a-month extended-release injection reduces the dose frequency and therefore may be advantageous in helping ensure patients' compliance, which is crucial to reduce potential relapse. Dr. Murphy: In order for a generic product to Vivitrol to be approved, it had to address several challenges in developing, manufacturing, and demonstrating that their naltrexone microsphere product was therapeutically equivalent to Vivitrol. One of these difficulties was selecting a PLG polymer that has comparable physicochemical and drug release properties to that brand product.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^111YLRWG]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Older adults — withdrawal management can be complicated by chronic diseases, slower metabolism of medications, blunted physiological responses that can affect the validity of monitoring tools such as the COWS, and misinterpretation of cognitive changes associated with withdrawal as being due to dementia. In general, the treatments discussed in this guideline are applicable to older adults; however, medications to manage withdrawal should be modified to account for age-related factors, such as increased sensitivity to medications, drug-drug interactions, or co-existing conditions. For example, long-acting benzodiazepines are not necessarily preferred in older patients for managing alcohol withdrawal due to the risk of accumulation leading to oversedation and respiratory depression, and withdrawal may also take longer due to slower metabolism among older adults. Management of withdrawal in older adults may require increased monitoring for side effects and/or lower medication dosages. The recommendations presented in this document for management of withdrawal from alcohol, sedatives, opioids, and stimulants are generally applicable to older adults as long as sensitivity to medications and drug interactions are considered. The threshold for transferring an older adult patient to a community facility and/or higher level of care for withdrawal management should be lower than it is for younger adults.

Assessment for substance use and treatment history — key intake elements for patients identified as using opioids include that completing a history of opioid misuse "should focus on the following: 1. type and amount of opioid(s) used recently; 2. route of administration; 3. last use; 4. treatment history; and 5. problems resulting from drug use". The amount consumed influences withdrawal risk, and "it is useful to obtain an estimate of the amount used (each time and number of times per day)". Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) provide corroborating data and "it is recommended that they be utilized", with the document noting, "As of June 2019, Missouri is the only U.S. state without a statewide PDMP". A broader treatment history is also advised: "a history of outpatient and inpatient treatment for alcohol and other substance use disorders should be collected" and "Clinicians should ask for information about the type and duration of treatment and outcomes".

### Naltrexone may block euphoria-like placebo effect [^116Ehtke]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Naltrexone is a first-line treatment for alcohol use disorders in North America and Europe. It was prescribed to a 63-year-old patient in order to help control amounts of alcohol consumed per drinking occasion. The patient experienced a paradoxical, but consistent side effect of feeling inebriated each time he took naltrexone. In order to investigate this phenomenon we administered naltrexone and a placebo in a randomised double-blind fashion. The patient exhibited a 'high-like' response to all placebo capsules and a decrease in the subjectively perceived euphoria shortly after ingestion of naltrexone. Given that this placebo effect could be mediated via opioid receptors we suggest that this case illustrates the ability of naltrexone to eliminate the placebo effect. This feature of naltrexone, upon further investigation, might be used in randomised clinical trials in addition to or as an alternative to a placebo.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115y5ko4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations – treatment options (5–10) — Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives but do not meet criteria for a specific substance use disorder should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution in patients who are prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and while combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. Methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP or for those for whom buprenorphine has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting. Opioid dosing guidelines developed for chronic pain, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), are not applicable to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Regarding naltrexone, oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence; clinicians should reserve its use for patients who have been unable to comply with special adherence techniques (e.g., observed dosing), and extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, adherence issues. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) should be checked regularly to confirm medication adherence and to monitor the prescribing of other controlled substances.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^115CoXL5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CNCP is a major problem in society, affecting 25% of the general population. The prevalence of chronic pain is estimated to be higher among patients with substance use disorders than among the general population. The approach to management of CNCP in a patient with a comorbid alcohol use disorder requires careful consideration of risks and benefits of analgesic and adjunctive options for pain, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and cannabinoids. The patient with comorbid alcohol use disorder and chronic pain needs his/her alcohol disorder diagnosed and treated in an integrated way with the treatment of the pain. Considerations about selection of treatment for the pain must depend on treatment strategy and the success of the treatment strategy for the alcohol use disorder.

Acetaminophen may be a reasonable option short-term; however, risks of long-term use of acetaminophen in patients who continue to abuse alcohol remain unquantified. Risks associated with NSAID use generally outweigh potential benefits in patients with an alcohol use disorder. If NSAID therapy is chosen, the lowest effective dose is recommended and proton-pump inhibitor therapy should be considered in patients at increased risk of GI bleeds. Alcohol increases the risk of overdose and CNS depressant effects of opioids through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. There is risk of opioid misuse in patients with a history of a substance use disorder. For chronic neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids or SNRIs are alternatives to consider. Pregabalin has demonstrated benefits in preliminary clinical trials for reducing cravings, prolonging time to heavy drinking after withdrawal, and promotion of abstinence.SNRIs and TCAs are first line for treating neuropathic pain; however, their use is limited by adverse effects and drug interactions. Cannabinoids should generally be avoided due to their potential for worsening alcohol dependence and CNS depressant effects.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^114ukgDu]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Case vignette

The patient's pain was considered to be mixed nature, primarily neuropathic, though there seemed to be some component of nociceptive and, specifically, musculoskeletal pain. Opioids are not a preferred alternative because of the patient's high risk profile for misuse. Because of the patient's reported ongoing use of alcohol, acetaminophen and NSAIDs are not considered safe alternatives. Pregabalin was selected as a preferred therapeutic alternative for the management of the patient's primarily neuropathic pain. It also has potential to decrease cravings for alcohol, which is in line with the patient's goals.

### Strategies to identify patient risks of prescription opioid addiction when initiating opioids for pain: a systematic review [^111MGDtc]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can physicians identify patients with pain for whom prescription opioids can be safely prescribed?

Findings

This systematic review found that a history of opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder, a mental health diagnosis, and concomitant prescription of certain psychiatric medications may be associated with an increased risk of prescription opioid addiction. However, only the absence of a mood disorder appeared useful for identifying lower risk, and assessment tools incorporating combinations of patient characteristics and risk factors were not useful.

Meaning

This study suggests that there are few valid ways to identify patients who can be safely prescribed opioid analgesics.

### Sufentanil (Dsuvia) [^114RMYDw]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of DSUVIA abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing sufentanil, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use DSUVIA in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

DSUVIA, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Diagnosis recommendations — basis of diagnosis, clinical scales, and drug testing: Opioid use disorder is primarily diagnosed on the basis of the history provided by the patient and a comprehensive assessment that includes a physical examination. Validated clinical scales that measure withdrawal symptoms may be used to assist in the evaluation of patients with opioid use disorder. Drug testing is recommended during the comprehensive assessment process, and during treatment to monitor patients for adherence to prescribed medications and use of alcohol, illicit, and controlled substances, and the frequency of testing is determined by several factors including stability of the patient, type of treatment, and treatment setting.

2.1. Sample of patients

Our study was limited to the patients reported to the FDA in the NDA submissions. The number of patients available at each study step is presented in a CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1). Our analysis was limited to data on patients who met inclusion and not exclusion criteria, signed consent, and entered the titration phase, as only 3 studies collected even limited data on patients screened. The primary criterion for the selection of patients to be enrolled was the clinician's judgement. Enrollment required the presence of chronic pain, current use of opioid (or opioid naïve and eligibility for a trial of opioids), and the absence of comorbidities that would limit participation or put patients at potential risk, including a history of or active opioid or alcohol abuse. After signing consent, patients in 4 studies were required to provide a urine drug screen with results appropriate to their current treatment regimen at the start of the study. Measures of risk for opioid misuse (COMM and SOAP) were only used in 2 studies and not analyzed.

### Pharmacogenetic approaches to the treatment of alcohol addiction [^114fUZEx]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Addictive disorders are partly heritable, chronic, relapsing conditions that account for a tremendous disease burden. Currently available addiction pharmacotherapies are only moderately successful, continue to be viewed with considerable scepticism outside the scientific community and have not become widely adopted as treatments. More effective medical treatments are needed to transform addiction treatment and address currently unmet medical needs. Emerging evidence from alcoholism research suggests that no single advance can be expected to fundamentally change treatment outcomes. Rather, studies of opioid, corticotropin-releasing factor, GABA and serotonin systems suggest that incremental advances in treatment outcomes will result from an improved understanding of the genetic heterogeneity among patients with alcohol addiction, and the development of personalized treatments.

### Triazolam (Halcion) [^1132vUL4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Halcion concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Halcion than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Halcion, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Halcion is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing Halcion and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of Halcion, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of Halcion along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116HYfv9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

The clinical evidence reviews found evidence too limited to determine effects of patient demographics and comorbidities on risk for opioid-related harms. However, on the basis of observational studies (,–) and expert opinion, certain risk factors are likely to increase susceptibility to opioid-related harms and warrant incorporation of additional strategies into the management plan to mitigate risk. Clinicians should assess these risk factors periodically, with frequency individualized to patient comorbidities and other risk factors. For example, factors that vary over time, such as alcohol use, require more frequent assessment. Clinicians should offer naloxone and reevaluate patients more frequently (see Recommendation 7) when factors are present that increase risk for harm, such as sleep-disordered breathing, history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher dosages of opioids (e.g. ≥ 50 MME/day), and concurrent use of benzodiazepines with opioids. Experts from OWG had concerns about the cost of purchasing naloxone for patients with limited means and reported that purchasing of naloxone has in some cases been required to fill opioid prescriptions. In part because of these concerns and because in certain settings naloxone is directly provided by a practice or health system to patients, "offering" naloxone (which can be done by offering a prescription or by offering naloxone directly) is recommended rather than specifying "prescribing" naloxone. Clinicians, health systems, and payers should work to ensure patients can obtain naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment.

Patients with Sleep-Disordered Breathing, Including Sleep Apnea

A case-control analysis among veterans prescribed opioids found that sleep apnea was associated with increased risk for life-threatening respiratory/central nervous system depression or overdose. Careful monitoring and cautious dose titration should be used if opioids are prescribed for patients with mild sleep-disordered breathing. Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep-disordered breathing, whenever possible, to minimize risks for respiratory depression.

Short-acting, orally administered opioids — codeine (alone or in combination with APAP or ASA) — initial oral dosing in opioid-naïve adults is 15 to 30 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and for combination products the Maximum APAP dose: 4000 mg/d (2000 mg/d in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment). Pharmacokinetics are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 4 to 6, and t½ (hr): ~3. In special populations: Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution; Hepatic dysfunction: Conversion to active metabolite (morphine) may be reduced in patients with cirrhosis; avoid use in patients with liver disease; and Renal dysfunction: Use lower dosage or an alternative analgesic. Other considerations note that Codeine may be less effective in patients with decreased CYP-2D6 activity (due to poor CYP-2D6 metabolism or CYP-2D6 inhibiting drugs) because of decreased conversion to the active metabolite, morphine, and that CYP-2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers can have extensive conversion to morphine with increase in opioid-mediated effects.

### Supervised dosing with a long-acting opioid medication in the management of opioid dependence [^115Wy1kh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first-line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off-site consumption.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off-site consumption.

Search Methods

We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/). All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references on topic-related systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes. We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow-up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300). There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self-reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence). Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low-quality evidence), while in the cohort study all-cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person-years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27). No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid-related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose.

Authors' Conclusions

Take-home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take-home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow-up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence.

### Are opioids needed to treat chronic low back pain? A review of treatment options and analgesics in development [^1139jyM5]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

As others, have critiqued, there are no high-quality studies with long-term data (defined as > 1 year) on the safety and effectiveness of opioid treatment to reduce pain and improve function in patients with chronic pain. One reason for these limitations is that in order to gain FDA approval for analgesics with chronic pain indications, manufacturers are only required to do 12-week efficacy studies performed as double-blind RCTs. Not only would it be unethical to subject patients in pain to placebo for longer periods of time, enrollment and avoiding dropout in placebo studies for 1-year would be challenging for patients with active pain syndromes.

Despite limited high-quality data supporting long-term opioid use, clinical experience dictates, and guidelines recognize that opioid analgesics are an effective adjuvant for the treatment of refractory patients with moderate-to-severe CLBP. Clinicians need to weigh the analgesic benefit against the potential AEs including risk for opioid abuse, overdose, and other long-term effects.

Patient Selection

Healthcare practitioners should recognize that opioids should not be used routinely as monotherapy, and instead should be added to other nonpharmacologic and primary pharmacologic therapies. Patient selection is critical to the safety and success of opioid therapy. A personal or family history of drug or alcohol abuse and psychiatric comorbidities represent the most notable risk factors. Available tools such as the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain questionnaire, the Opioid Risk Tool, and the Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, Efficacy scoreare validated assessment tools that clinicians can utilize to stratify risk. In addition to careful patient selection, the actual choice of opioid molecule or formulation may be an important factor. Subtle but important pharmacological differences have been observed among the mu opioids; their potency, effectiveness, and adverse effects can vary unpredictably among patients.

### Association of opioid use disorder treatment with alcohol-related acute events… [^11218gVx]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This case-control cohort study of 13 335 individuals with OUD from a large, nationally representative data set found that patients prescribed OUD medication had significant reductions in alcohol-related acute events. Meaning The use of OUD medication in opioid-dependent patients with co-occurring alcohol use may hold promise in reducing alcohol-related acute events, but more investigation is needed. Thus, the exposure variable was various types of OUD pharmacologic treatments, and the outcome variable was alcohol-related acute events. We also examined whether patients with known recent AUD claims were more likely to receive naltrexone, given its dual FDA indications for AUD and OUD, as opposed to buprenorphine and methadone, and whether the association between OUD medication and alcohol-related events varies by the presence of recent AUD claims.

Our study shows that OUD treatment days were associated with reductions in overall odds of admissions for alcohol-related acute events. We observed risk reductions of 43% for buprenorphine and 66% for methadone treatment days. Extended-release and oral naltrexone treatment days were associated with 37% and 16% reductions, respectively. Of note, our results should be interpreted in conjunction with known differences in medication adherence. The true practical effectiveness of antagonist therapies may be hindered by lower medication adherence associated with naltrexone compared with agonist treatments in the OUD population. For instance, substantially greater medication adherence has been observed for buprenorphine treatment compared with both extended-release and oral naltrexone, 29 with patients with OUD found to show similar adherence to methadone and buprenorphine.

30 As our study evaluates ORs that describe protective outcomes associated with medication at a given point in time, the protective outcomes observed in association with buprenorphine and methadone treatment days are likely to be amplified by their higher adherence rates compared with naltrexone. The findings of this study suggest that OUD medications are associated with decreased hospital admissions for alcohol-related acute events among persons with OUD. Although naltrexone use was more prevalent among patients with OUD with recent AUD claims, agonist treatments also were associated with fewer alcohol-related events. The present study raises key questions about the potential of OUD medications for reducing alcohol-related events and highlights the need for additional research in this area.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115QPhv5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — assessment recommendations (co-occurring substance use, other drug use policy, nicotine, and multidimensional assessment): Opioid use disorder is often co-occurring with other substance use disorders, and evaluation of a patient with opioid use disorder should include a detailed history of other past and current substance use and substance use disorders. The use of cannabis, stimulants, alcohol, and/or other addictive drugs should not be a reason to withhold or suspend opioid use disorder treatment, though patients who are actively using substances during opioid use disorder treatment may require a more intensive level of care and careful monitoring. A nicotine use query should be completed routinely for all patients and counseling on cessation of the use of tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices (e.g., vaping) provided if indicated. As part of comprehensive care the patient should receive a multidimensional assessment, including an assessment of social and environmental factors to identify facilitators and barriers to addiction treatment and long-term recovery, and addiction is a complex biopsychosocial illness, for which the use of medication(s) is only one component of comprehensive treatment.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113DrD3U]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Medications — pharmacotherapy effectiveness for withdrawal from certain substances is well established, including benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal and buprenorphine or methadone for opioid withdrawal. Medication used to manage withdrawal must be ordered by a licensed prescriber for a specific patient; however, a prescriber order is not required to administer naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdose. Correctional and health care staff alike should be well-trained to regard naloxone as a life-saving tool for opioid overdoses, multiple doses of naloxone may be needed, and individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) may experience withdrawal symptoms after receiving naloxone.

### Beliefs about perioperative opioid and alcohol use among elective surgical patients who report unhealthy drinking: a qualitative study [^112RCyrt]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Recommendations

The heterogeneity and spectrum of beliefs among individuals with unhealthy alcohol use undergoing elective surgery points to the need to first assess beliefs, then educate, and finally intervene strategically in this patient population (see Table 2). In terms of screening enhancement, pre-operative screening for unhealthy alcohol use, pain management intentions, and expectancies regarding opioid effects could be beneficial. Our findings also suggest intervention stratification depending on individuals' risk level. Low-risk individuals could benefit from basic education about opioid use and addiction risks and reminders to avoid alcohol use while using prescribed opioids. For individuals with specific risk factors, additional interventions are warranted, possibly including motivational interviewing, alternative pain management techniques (e.g. acupuncture, mindfulness-based treatments), and monitoring of opioid use with follow-up as appropriate. This should likely be done regardless of individuals' confidence in their ability to control opioid use. An additional assessment of expectancies related to opioid-based pain medications may further differentiate risk trajectories and identify those in need of more intensive interventions. Our findings suggest that individuals have clear preferences for and past experiences with opioids that could be elucidated through assessment and trigger more or less intensive prevention efforts in a stratified format.

Regarding alcohol use, improving alcohol screening prior to surgery could improve identification of individuals at risk. For those who report unhealthy alcohol use, additional interventions and referral to treatment may be warranted. Coordination with pain management specialists could benefit those who use alcohol to manage pain. Those with unhealthy alcohol use would also benefit from enhanced education and conversations about the risks of opioid and alcohol co-use including overdose and, in some cases, naloxone access when appropriate.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^112UFpWb]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

A personal history of substance or alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor for opioid misuse.

If a trial of opioid therapy is determined to be appropriate despite this risk, current guidelines recommend implementation of structured opioid therapy, including a written opioid agreement that outlines the responsibilities of the physician and the patient, shorter refill frequency, close monitoring, and urine drug screening to discourage aberrant behaviors.

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence as part of a psychotherapeutic program to support abstinence and reduce risk of relapse. It does not cause disulfiram-like reactions when alcohol is ingested; however, its opioid antagonistic effects may precipitate acute opioid withdrawal in those who have developed physical dependence from regular opioid use.

Treatment alternatives for chronic neuropathic pain

Three consensus guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain have been published.–Though selected classes of medications are recommended as first, second, third, or fourth line in the guidelines, evidence is limited and selection of medications depends heavily on individual patient factors. Considerations for use of these medications in a patient with a concurrent alcohol use disorder are presented here.

Tricyclic antidepressants

There are no studies of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for the treatment of co-occurring neuropathic pain and alcohol dependence; however, treatment with TCAs (eg, desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline) in co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence has been described. All studies demonstrated benefit of the TCA on reducing depressive symptoms; however, two were positive (desipramine, amitriptyline) and one negative (imipramine) for reduction of drinking. It has been demonstrated that chronic drinking accelerates clearance of TCAs, likely due to an increased activation of liver enzymes. Higher doses may be required to achieve therapeutic concentrations.

For patients taking disulfiram for management of alcohol use disorder, two case reports have described that use of amitriptyline potentiates the effect of disulfiram and increases the risk of a psychotic and confused mental state. The probable mechanism is elevated levels of various monoamines and potentially increased dopamine levels.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^117Ghw8c]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — rationale and patient factors — the intent of these guidelines is to increase the use of multimodal analgesia (MMA) and to improve pain management for the more than 50% of patients who report inadequate pain relief while in the ICU. MMA decreases opioid requirements in the ICU, and a recent survey of trauma surgeons documented that they were prescribing fewer opioids. It is imperative to account for a patient's past medical history and comorbidities when choosing an analgesic regimen, and patients with SUD prior to admission are often an MMA challenge when attempting to manage alcohol or drug withdrawal and achieve satisfactory levels of analgesia. It is important to recognize that under- and over-treatment of pain contributes to the development of chronic pain syndromes, specifically in the ICU; chronic pain syndromes are common following trauma and surgery, and an increasing number of reports address hyperalgesia in response to opioids and the relation of hyperalgesia to chronic pain syndrome development. The goal is to avoid inadequate pain management while assuring the analgesia provided matches the severity of pain experienced by the patient.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1143PETW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder — treatment setting and co-prescribed sedatives: The venue in which treatment is provided should be carefully considered, with methadone only provided in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and acute care settings (under limited circumstances), buprenorphine prescribed by waivered clinicians in any setting, including OTPs and office based opioid treatment (OBOT) in accordance with the Federal law (21 CFR §1301.28), and naltrexone prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe medication; clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining which treatment setting is most appropriate. Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, or who are in treatment for a substance use disorder involving use of alcohol or other sedative drugs, including benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists, may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives, even if they do not meet the criteria for diagnosis of a specific substance use disorder related to that class of drugs, should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with extreme caution in patients prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted when deciding whether to co-prescribe these medications; methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP, or for patients for whom buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with other substance use disorders, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not withhold or suspend OUD treatment in patients using cannabis, stimulants, alcohol, and/or other addictive drugs. Consider providing greater support, including a more intensive level of care for patients actively using substances during OUD treatment.

### Morphine sulfate (Avinza) [^112diG5e]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

AVINZA MUST BE SWALLOWED WHOLE (NOT CHEWED, CRUSHED, OR DISSOLVED) OR AVINZA MAY BE OPENED AND THE ENTIRE BEAD CONTENTS SPRINKLED ON A SMALL AMOUNT OF APPLESAUCE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO INGESTION. THE BEADS MUST NOT BE CHEWED, CRUSHED, OR DISSOLVED DUE TO RISK OF ACUTE OVERDOSE. INGESTING CHEWED OR CRUSHED AVINZA BEADS WILL LEAD TO THE RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY TOXIC DOSE OF MORPHINE.

Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages while on AVINZA therapy. Additionally, patients must not use prescription or non-prescription medicine containing alcohol while on AVINZA therapy. Consumption of alcohol while taking AVINZA may result in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.

The daily dose of AVINZA must be limited to a maximum of 1600 mg/day. AVINZA doses of over 1600 mg/day contain a quantity of fumaric acid that has not been demonstrated to be safe, and which may result in serious renal toxicity. (see WARNINGS)

The 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 mg capsules are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients.

All doses are intended to be administered once daily. As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of AVINZA, attention should be given to the following:

the total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent morphine dose needed;
the patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
the general condition and medical status of the patient;
concurrent medications;
the type and severity of the patient's pain.

The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to AVINZA

Patients receiving other oral morphine formulations may be converted to AVINZA by administering the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as AVINZA once-daily. AVINZA should not be given more frequently than every 24 hours. As with conversion from any oral morphine formulation to another, supplemental pain medication may be required until the response to the patient's daily AVINZA dosage has stabilized (up to 4 days).

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride [^112FJrCG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oxymorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets

Abuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.

Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.

### Development of a risk index for serious prescription opioid-induced respiratory depression or overdose in veterans' health administration patients [^1111rrN1]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Intended Use and Interpretation of Results

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention 65. Approximately 80% of pain episodes treated with opioids in the United States are short‐term 60, 63. However, an estimated 100 million to 116 million U.S. adults have chronic pain 65, 66. The prescription of opioids to manage chronic noncancer pain increased dramatically since 2000 to approximately 9 million individuals annually 5, 6, 7, 9, 67. Managing acute, episodic, or chronic pain with opioids is particularly challenging due to the multidimensionality of pain and the multitude of influences affecting opioid efficacy and safety. RIOSORD, which is based on a multivariable regression model, integrates independent risk factors and adjusts for confounding influences. As a result, RIOSORD can provide valuable decision support to health care professionals to manage pain more safely and effectively, particularly in complex patients who are biologically vulnerable to serious opioid‐related CNS or respiratory depression. RIOSORD supports but does not replace the health care provider's judgment in clinical decision‐making.

RIOSORD is intended as a screening tool to be used by a health care professional before prescribing opioids, to assess a patient's baseline risk of opioid‐induced respiratory depression or overdose. It also can be employed periodically during ongoing opioid treatment to re‐evaluate risk based on changes in a patient's clinical condition or medication regimen. Explaining the RIOSORD score to a patient creates an opportunity to discuss the benefits and risks associated with the use of opioids. It also facilitates patient education regarding the word overdose and the importance of adjusting modifiable risk factors (e.g. adhering to prescribed treatment for comorbidities such as sleep apnea, or minimizing use of neurodepressive psychoactive substances and medications). For example, the provider may begin a discussion with, "Patients with risk scores similar to yours" (e.g. 50 points) "were predicted to have an x % chance" (e.g. 76%) "of experiencing a life‐threatening opioid emergency such as an overdose with slow or very shallow breathing and unresponsiveness. This can occur under certain conditions despite taking your opioid medication exactly as prescribed. You can reduce your risk by… " (e.g. "using your CPAP device for sleep apnea, following opioid dose instructions, and not drinking alcohol").

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114M2Bb4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Assessment for co-occurring substance use — screening, risks, and treatment approach in opioid use disorder are emphasized as follows: "Opioid use disorder often co-occurs with alcohol, nicotine, and other substance use disorders", so "evaluation of co-occurring alcohol, nicotine, or substance use (including prescription medication misuse) is recommended", and "Clinicians should assess signs and symptoms of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or withdrawal". "Alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may result in seizures, hallucinosis, or delirium, and may represent a medical emergency", and "concomitant use of alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with opioids may contribute to respiratory depression". Patients with more severe co-use may need escalated care: "Patients with significant co-occurring substance use disorders, especially severe alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, may require a higher level of care". Regarding gabapentinoids, "A 2017 systematic review reported that increasing numbers of patients are self-administering higher than recommended doses of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) to achieve euphoric highs", and "Among opioid users the reported prevalence of gabapentinoid misuse ranged from 3% to 68%". Prognosis and treatment access are addressed: "Evidence suggests that individuals who are actively using other substances during opioid use disorder treatment may have a poorer prognosis", yet "The Guideline Committee cautioned against excluding patients from treatment for their opioid use disorder because they are using cannabis or other psychoactive substances". Initiation of care should not be delayed in most cases: "In most cases, co-occurring substance use will not represent a medical emergency. In such cases, patients can begin treatment for both their opioid use disorder and co-occurring alcohol or substance use disorders". The guideline also warns that "Suspension of opioid use disorder treatment may increase the risk for death from overdose, accidents, or other health problems", and that "Continued use of cannabis or other psychoactive substances may impede treatment for opioid use disorder".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112WqaGC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Assessment for opioid use disorder (OUD) states: "The first clinical priority should be given to identifying and making appropriate referral for any urgent or emergent medical or psychiatric problem(s), including drug-related impairment or overdose". "Comprehensive assessment of the patient is critical for treatment planning. However, completion of all assessments should not delay or preclude initiating pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. If not completed before initiating treatment, assessments should be completed soon thereafter". "Completion of the patient's medical history should include screening for common medical conditions, including psychiatric disorders, infectious diseases (viral hepatitis, HIV, and tuberculosis [TB]), acute trauma, and pregnancy". "Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, liver enzyme tests, and tests for TB, hepatitis B and C, and HIV. Testing for sexually transmitted infections should be strongly considered. Hepatitis A and B vaccinations should be offered, if appropriate". "Women of childbearing potential should be tested for pregnancy, and all women of childbearing potential should be queried regarding methods of contraception". "Patients being evaluated for opioid use disorder, and/or for possible medications use in the treatment of opioid use disorder, should undergo (or have completed) an assessment of mental health status and possible psychiatric disorders (such as is outlined in The ASAM Criteria and The ASAM Standards)". "Opioid use disorder is often co-occurring with other substance use disorders. Evaluation of a patient with opioid use disorder should include a detailed history of other past and current substance use and substance use disorders". "The use of cannabis, stimulants, alcohol, and/or other addictive drugs should not be a reason to withhold or suspend opioid use disorder treatment. However, patients who are actively using substances during opioid use disorder treatment may require greater support including a more intensive level of care (see The ASAM Criteria and The ASAM Standards)". "The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine. While the combined use of these medications increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. A risk-benefit analysis should be conducted, and greater support should be provided including careful medication management to reduce risks". "A nicotine use query should be completed routinely for all patients and counseling on cessation of the use of tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices (ex. vaping) provided if indicated". "As part of comprehensive care the patient should receive a multidimensional assessment (as described in The ASAM Criteria), including an assessment of social and environmental factors to identify facilitators and barriers to addiction treatment and long-term recovery (including pharmacotherapy). Addiction is a complex biopsychosocial illness, for which the use of medication(s) is only one component of comprehensive treatment".

### Alcohol and drug overdose and the influence of pain conditions in an addiction treatment sample [^114BZBeN]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Overdose from alcohol and/or drugs kills tens of thousands of Americans annually, with a large number of deaths attributed to opioid pain medications. Addiction treatment patients are known to be at high risk for overdose; however, the relationship between pain and overdose history within this group is understudied, especially in relation to alcohol overdoses. In the present study, we evaluated whether nonfatal overdose history was more likely among addiction treatment patients with pain, and examined the characteristics of overdoses among those with and without pain.

Methods

We analyzed cross-sectional data from 739 patients at a large residential addiction treatment center (median age 37, 25.7% female). We used 2-stepped binary regression models to evaluate whether demographics, pain type (chronic, acute, or both), depression symptoms, and opioid misuse were associated with lifetime history of nonfatal (1) alcohol and (2) drug overdose (lifetime yes/no), and conducted follow-up analyses examining overdose characteristics.

Results

In adjusted analyses, history of chronic pain (odds ratio [OR] 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59, 4.27) and illicit drug use (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.07, 3.68) were associated with an increased likelihood of nonfatal alcohol overdose. Opioid misuse (OR 3.11, 95% CI 2.51, 3.86), depression symptoms (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14, 1.55), and younger age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) were associated with increased likelihood of drug overdose. Those with pain reported a higher number of lifetime alcohol overdoses and were more likely to combine numerous drugs with alcohol before overdose.

Conclusions

Pain conditions may play an under-recognized role in the overdose epidemic, particularly alcohol-related overdose. Addiction treatment and overdose prevention interventions should incorporate appropriate assessment and treatment of pain including education about the risks of polysubstance use, particularly combining alcohol with sedatives and prescription pain relievers.

### Association of opioid use disorder treatment with alcohol-related acute events [^113vNsXJ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Despite the therapeutic challenge of treating alcohol and opioid co-use, there is reason to believe that existing OUD medications may hold promise in treating comorbid AUD, thus potentially reducing alcohol-related risk among patients with AUD. For instance, some treatment options for dual-diagnosis patients overlap, such as naltrexone, which holds dual US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications for OUD and AUD treatment and has been found to be used more commonly in patients with both OUD and AUD than patients with OUD but without comorbid AUD (Mintz CM, Presnall NJ, Xu KY, et al, unpublished data, November 2020). However, few studies have directly evaluated the efficacy of OUD medications on alcohol-related outcomes among patients with OUD, and the limited research base has been marked by inconsistent results. For instance, although an open randomized studysuggested that methadone and buprenorphine suppressed alcohol intake in heroin users, other analyseshave not replicated these effects, with some studiesshowing increased problematic use of alcohol after initiation of opioid agonist treatment. Existing studies, are also characterized by short follow-up periods, modest sample sizes, and self-reported data.

Given the research gaps on alcohol-related outcomes among patients with OUD, our study used the IBM MarketScan Commercial and Multi-State Medicaid databases (2006–2016) to evaluate the association of 3 OUD medication treatments — buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone — with emergency and inpatient admissions for acute alcohol-related events, specifically falls, injuries, and poisonings in patients with OUD.

Since 2010, medical toxicology physicians from the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) have provided reports on their in-hospital and clinic patient consultations to a national case registry, known as the ToxIC Core Registry. De-identified patient data entered into the registry includes patient demographics, reason for medical toxicology evaluation, exposure agents, clinical signs and symptoms, treatments and antidotes administered, and mortality. This thirteenth annual report provides data from 7206 patients entered into the Core Registry in 2022 by 35 participating sites comprising 52 distinct healthcare facilities, bringing the total case count to 94,939. Opioid analgesics were the most commonly reported exposure agent class (15.9%), followed by ethanol (14.9%), non-opioid analgesic (12.8%), and antidepressants (8.0%). Opioids were the leading agent of exposure for the first time in 2022 since the Core Registry started. There were 118 fatalities (case fatality rate of 1.6%). Additional descriptive analyses in this annual report were conducted to describe the location of the patient during hospitalization, telemedicine consultations, and addiction medicine treatments.

### Alcohol use disorder in the perioperative period: a summary and recommendations for anesthesiologists and pain physicians [^117KZA2T]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD) increase the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Aspiration, malnutrition, coagulopathies, seizures, and hemodynamic alterations are only a few of the major concerns related to acute alcohol intoxication and AUD. There are also numerous physiological effects, changes in medication metabolism and pharmacology, and adverse events related to chronic alcohol consumption. These are all important considerations for the anesthesiologist in the perioperative management of a patient with AUD. Pain perception and thresholds are altered in patients with acute and chronic alcohol use. Medications used to manage AUD symptoms, particularly naltrexone, can have significant perioperative implications. Patients on naltrexone who continue or stop this medication in the perioperative period are at an increased risk for undertreated pain or substance use relapse. This review highlights key considerations for the anesthesiologist and pain physician in the perioperative management of patients with active AUD (or those in recovery). It discusses the effects of acute and chronic alcohol use on pain perception and thresholds, provides guidance on the perioperative management of naltrexone and low-dose naltrexone, and reviews a multimodal approach to pain management.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of DURAMORPH abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing morphine, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use DURAMORPH in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

DURAMORPH, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

### The need for biochemical testing for alcohol in integrated addiction treatment settings during the opioid epidemic [^1144hf5T]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

As the opioid crisis drives expansion of integrated opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment programs in generalist settings, these programs will contend with significant rates of co-occurring alcohol use. The authors present a brief literature review and commentary regarding nondisordered and disordered alcohol use in OUD treatment settings and biochemical detection techniques. Biochemical testing for alcohol in integrated OUD treatment settings is both important for detecting alcohol use disorder and feasible. Breathalyzer testing may assist with management of acutely intoxicated patients. Biochemical testing for alcohol is an important part of integrated OUD treatment. More research is needed on the impact of alcohol use on OUD treatment outcomes and the role of breathalyzer testing in management of intoxicated patients in the outpatient setting.

ASIPP guidelines — Side effect management and safety counseling: During dosage titration of opioid therapy, advise patients to avoid dangerous activities (e.g., driving or using heavy machinery) until a stable dosage is established and it is certain the opioid dose does not cause sedation. Warn about the greatly increased risks for sedation and respiratory depression when opioids are combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedating drugs. For bowel dysfunction, consider initiation of a prophylactic bowel regimen despite mostly anecdotal evidence, using increased fluid and fiber intake, stool softeners, and laxatives, and note that evidence is insufficient to recommend opioid antagonists to prevent bowel dysfunction. When assessing driving safety on long‑term therapy, consider factors that impair cognition and psychomotor ability such as a consistently severe pain rating, disordered sleep, and sedating concomitant medications.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^114qvrhb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Alcohol Screening

For patients with a substance use disorder, alcohol may be problematic and prohibited in any amount; for other patients with chronic pain, only high-risk alcohol use (e.g. binge drinking) is a concern. Many opioids include black box warnings about the concurrent use of alcohol because of the potential for fatal overdose. One reviewed guideline recommends screening for alcohol with UDM in patients with chronic pain; ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, or ethanol in UDM indicates alcohol use. As a caveat, immunoassay and definitive UDM may not differentiate between alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing medications, mouthwashes, and hand sanitizers. Instead of UDM, the panelists recommend the SISQ "How many times in the past year have you had (five or more drinks [men], four or more drinks [women]) in a day?" from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to identify unhealthy alcohol use, as this question is simple to administer and is validated. In primary care settings, the sensitivity of the alcohol SISQ for identifying alcohol use disorder is 88%, and the specificity is 84%.

Cannabis Screening

Practices for cannabis screening vary; individual prescribers can decide whether detecting cannabis by UDM is appropriate by consulting local laws and common practice, as well as by considering the advantages/disadvantages discussed below. At the time of this publication, cannabis is federally illegal (i.e. classified by the US Drug Enforcement Administration as Schedule 1 under the Controlled Substances Act), but several states have passed legislation to decriminalize it for medical and/or recreational use. The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain indicates that the clinical implications of a positive UDM result for cannabis are uncertain; the VA/US Department of Defense guidelines estimate the length of time it can be detected in urine; and the Washington State guidelines suggest implementing an office policy for patients who use cannabis. These guidelines and this consensus report do not provide formal graded recommendations for or against UDM screening for cannabis or for interpretation of the results.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Oxycodone and acetaminophen) [^116iBkdX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death.

Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.

Dependence

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.

### Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence [^112LY4p1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The results from animal studies suggest that opioid antagonists may prevent the reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption. Based on the results of those animal studies, some opioid antagonists, such as, naltrexone, nalmefene, have been studied for their benefits in treating alcohol dependence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of opioid antagonists in attenuating or preventing the recommencement of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence in comparison to placebo, other medications and psychosocial treatments. In addition, discontinuation rate, death, patient satisfaction, functioning, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes were also evaluated.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library 2001, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001), EMBASE (1980 - December 2001), and CINHAL (1982 - December 2001) were undertaken. Du Pont Pharmaceutical and Ivax Corporation were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. The reference lists of the obtained papers were also examined.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were included. Participants were people with alcohol dependence. Naltrexone (NTX), nalmefene (NMF) and other opioid antagonists with/without other biological or psychosocial treatments were examined. Four primary outcomes of interest were number of patients who return to drinking, percentage or number of drinking days, number of standard drinks of alcohol and amount of alcohol consumed. A number of secondary outcomes were also considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers evaluated and extracted the data independently. The dichotomous data were extracted on an intention-to-treat basis. The Relative Risk with the 95% confidence interval was used to assess the dichotomous data. Weighted (or Standardised) Mean Difference with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the continuous data.

Main Results

The review included 19 RCTs or CCTs presented in 26 articles. In comparison to placebo, two of four short-term primary outcomes were significantly in favour of NTX. Those were number of patients who return to drinking (61% in NTX group vs 69% in placebo group) [RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.80 to 0.98), NNT = 14] and percentage or number of drinking days [WMD (95% CI) = -4.52 (-5.29 to -3.75)]. However, the short-term discontinuation rates were high and not different between NTX and placebo groups [RR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.81 to 1.13)]. No medium-term outcomes of NTX and placebo groups showed any significant difference after the completion of NTX treatment for three to six months. However, those who were regularly treated with NTX treatment in both short and medium terms consumed smaller amounts of alcohol than placebo-treated patients. Because of the small sample sizes, there were few significant differences for other comparisons.

Reviewer's Conclusions

NTX at the dose of 50 mg/day is effective for alcohol dependence in short-term treatment. The optimal duration of NTX treatment may be longer than 3 months. The evidence so far may be too little to support the superiority of NTX to acamprosate and the inferiority of NTX to disulfiram. NTX treatment should be concurrently given with a psychosocial intervention. Other patterns of NTX administration should not be used at present, e.g., a dose of three times a week, combined NTX with other biological treatments. NMF has no role for the treatment of alcohol dependence in clinical practice. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of NTX treatment in patients with alcohol dependence are still needed. Some issues should be concerned in further studies. Firstly, further trials should be conducted in larger sample sizes and over longer periods of time. Secondly, other than the outcomes relevant to alcohol use, some important outcomes should also be measured, e.g., functioning, health-related quality of life, economic cost. Thirdly, the comparisons between NTX and other treatments for alcohol dependence, both biological and psychosocial, should be investigated. Fourthly, combined treatments of NTX and other biological treatments for alcohol dependence may be in issue of interest. Lastly, high discontinuation rate in both treatment and control groups should be concerned.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^111h13da]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain — future research priorities include the comparative effectiveness of opioids versus non-opioid interventions (both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for pain; promising interdisciplinary pain care practices with and without opioid prescribing; and social-environmental, behavioral, psychological, and other factors that affect the transition from short-term to chronic opioid use. Intersection of opioid use disorder (OUD) priorities include outcomes related to the transition to chronic opioid use in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) versus OUD; medication treatment for OUD in patients with co-occurring OUD and chronic pain; treatment strategies that concurrently address pain and OUD to improve patient outcomes; and treatment of pain in patients with co-occurring OUD and acute or chronic pain. The page states that future studies focusing on outcomes of interest, including serious adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), are needed and that future research that incorporates diverse demographics to represent the population is required.

### Prevalence and impact of alcohol and other drug use disorders on sedation and mechanical ventilation: a retrospective study [^111YtE6K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

AOD was classified according to the substance used: alcohol, benzodiazepines or barbiturates, heroin, opioids (other than heroin), cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana and other (excluding nicotine). Diagnosis of AOD was assigned if the disorder was present within one year previous to initiation of MV. Medical records were reviewed for the target admission as well as previous admissions and outpatient visits. To maximize diagnostic accuracy, experts in Addiction Medicine and Psychiatry assigned the diagnosis (MFW, JT). Diagnosis was established through review of toxicology results, medical records, and based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition TR (DSM IV-TR) (Table 1).

Table 1
Definition of Substance Dependence and Substance Abuse

- **Medical record**: When physician notes explicitly documented the presence of alcohol or drug abuse, dependence, and/or addiction, the patient was classified as having AOD. When the terms abuse, dependence or addiction were not documented in the record, the patient was not diagnosed with AOD based on review of medical records alone.

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Definitions of substance dependence and substance abuse as defined in DSM IV-TR are outlined in Table 1. If details in the medical history permitted, patients were diagnosed with AOD. For example, patients who presented to the Emergency Department with trauma and intoxication were diagnosed with AOD. As another example, patients with a history of withdrawal syndromes while on the inpatient ward were diagnosed with AOD. As a third example, patients with history of alcoholic cirrhosis who had consumed alcohol within the previous year were diagnosed with AOD.

- **Toxicology results**: If these revealed the presence of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or amphetamine, patients were considered to have AOD. Patients with toxicology results that were positive for other opioids, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates were diagnosed with AOD if the substances were not administered by a healthcare professional prior to collection of urine or blood samples. Positive toxicology results for alcohol could be used only if they supported a clinical diagnosis (e.g. alcohol withdrawal syndromes, alcoholic cirrhosis), and could not be used in isolation.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Diagnosis of opioid use disorder (OUD) states that "Other clinicians may diagnose opioid use disorder, but confirmation of the diagnosis must be obtained by the prescriber before pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder commences". "Opioid use disorder is primarily diagnosed on the basis of the history furnished by the patient, clinician's observations, and sometimes information from family and/or review of the patient's medical, drug use, and prescription drug use history". "Validated clinical scales that measure withdrawal symptoms may be used to assist in the evaluation of patients with opioid use disorder". "Drug testing is recommended during the comprehensive assessment process, and during treatment to monitor patients for adherence to prescribed medications and use of alcohol, illicit, and controlled substances", with frequency determined by "stability of the patient, type of treatment, and treatment setting".

### Beliefs about perioperative opioid and alcohol use among elective surgical patients who report unhealthy drinking: a qualitative study [^116RJxd9]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Elective surgical patients with unhealthy alcohol use have unique pain management needs and addiction risk factors that are relevant to surgical preparation and recovery. This descriptive qualitative study sought to better understand patients' beliefs and behaviors related to opioid use, alcohol use, and pain management in the perioperative context.

Design

We conducted individual semi-structured interviews between July 2017 and March 2018.

Setting

A large Midwestern academic health system.

Subjects

Participants were elective surgical patients meeting unhealthy alcohol use criteria, recruited from the health system's preoperative anesthesia clinic.

Method

Semistructured interview guides explored beliefs and behaviors relating to alcohol and opioid use, health status, and surgical care. Interview recordings were transcribed and coded for thematic analysis.

Results

Among 20 elective surgical patients (25% female), we identified three key themes regarding alcohol use, opioid use, and their co-use before and after surgery. First, desires and intentions to use opioids for postoperative pain management varied widely, even before opioids were prescribed. Second, some participants described alcohol as a preferred pain management strategy. Third, participants held a range of beliefs about the risks and benefits of alcohol and opioid co-use.

Conclusions

Appropriate assessment of beliefs and intentions regarding opioid and alcohol use could help identify patients most vulnerable to new opioid problems and unhealthy alcohol use in the context of perioperative surgical pain. These findings have important implications for perioperative pain management.

### Perioperative naltrexone management: a scoping review by the perioperative pain and addiction interdisciplinary network [^113F7dKx]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, are a public health concern that affect more than 150 million people globally. The opioid antagonist naltrexone is being increasingly prescribed to treat opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and chronic pain. Perioperative management of patients on naltrexone is inconsistent and remains a controversial topic, with mismanagement posing a significant risk to the long-term health of these patients. This scoping review was conducted to identify human studies in which the perioperative management of naltrexone was described. This review includes a systematic literature search involving Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Seventeen articles that describe perioperative naltrexone management strategies were included, including thirteen guidelines, one case report, and three randomized trials. Despite its use in patients with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain, no clinical studies, case reports, or guidelines addressed naltrexone use in these clinical populations. All of the guideline documents recommended the preoperative cessation of naltrexone, irrespective of dose, indication, or route of administration. None of these guideline documents were designed on the basis of a systematic literature search or a Delphi protocol. As described by the primary studies, perioperative pain relief varied depending on naltrexone dose and route of administration, time since last naltrexone administration, and underlying substance use disorder. None of the studies commented on the maintenance of recovery for the patient's substance use disorder in the context of perioperative naltrexone management. The current understanding of the risks and benefits of continuing or stopping naltrexone perioperatively is limited by a lack of high-quality evidence. In patients with risk factors for return to use of opioids or alcohol, the discontinuation of naltrexone should have a strong rationale. Future studies and guidelines should seek to address both acute pain management and maintaining recovery when discussing perioperative naltrexone management strategies.

### Oxycodone (oxycodone hydrochloride) [^11685rX5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of oxycodone HCl abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oxycodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use oxycodone HCl in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Oxycodone HCl, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxycodone HCl

Abuse of oxycodone HCl poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of oxycodone HCl with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.

Oxycodone HCl is approved for oral use only.

Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^1167EhT3]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113QMH4T]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder on the basis of patient concerns or behaviors or on findings in PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) or from toxicology testing (see Recommendation 10), they should discuss their concern with their patient and provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose related concerns or problems. Clinicians should assess for the presence of opioid use disorder using DSM-5 criteria. Opioid use disorder can coexist with other substance use disorders, and patients who are actively using substances during opioid use disorder treatment might require greater support, potentially including involvement of an addiction specialist. Clinicians should ask about use of alcohol and other substances (see Recommendation 8). Alternatively, clinicians can arrange for a substance use disorder treatment specialist to assess for the presence of opioid and other substance use disorders.

For patients meeting criteria for opioid use disorder, particularly if moderate or severe, clinicians should offer or arrange for patients to receive evidence-based treatment with medications for opioid use disorder. Patients with opioid use disorder might benefit from counseling and referrals to mutual help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous, although this should not take the place of treatment with medication. Clinicians also should offer naloxone and training on proper use for overdose reversal to patients with opioid use disorder and to their household members and significant others (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians should not dismiss patients from their practice because of opioid use disorder because this can adversely affect patient safety. Identification of opioid use disorder represents an opportunity for a clinician to initiate potentially life-saving interventions, and it is important for the clinician to collaborate with the patient regarding their safety to increase the likelihood of successful treatment. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for return to drug use, overdose, and overdose death.

### Association of opioid use disorder treatment with alcohol-related acute events [^116pVRMH]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, an unprecedented epidemic of drug-related poisonings has affected countries spanning North America and Europe. Recent estimates of unintentional poisoning deaths (19.1 deaths per 100 000) have eclipsed those of falls (11.4 deaths per 100 000) and motor vehicle traffic deaths (11.6 deaths per 100 000). This is evidenced by an all-time high of 70 980 overdose deaths in the US in 2019. Although the medical community has largely focused on the central role of opioid use disorder (OUD), polysubstance use has been underrecognized, even though most patients with substance use disorder use multiple substances, and the presence of multiple substance use disorders is associated with worse treatment outcomes.

Alcohol is the most commonly misused substance, both as a standalone drug and in the context of polysubstance use. More than 25% of patients with OUD exhibit problematic alcohol use, and, therefore, mitigation of risk for incident or recurrent alcohol use disorder (AUD) presents a salient problem in the treatment of OUD. As central nervous system depressants, alcohol and opioids can be lethal in combination, leading to increased overdoses and mortality among patients with OUD, in addition to increased health care utilization. Because problematic alcohol and opioid use are traditionally studied as independent conditions, limited evidence-based strategies exist for mitigation of alcohol-related risk among patients with OUD.

### Availability of medications for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorder in the USA [^112GeDaZ]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite high mortality rates due to opioid overdose and excessive alcohol consumption, medications for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorder have not been widely used in the USA. This paper provides an overview of the literature on the availability of alcohol and opioid used disorder medications in the specialty substance use disorder treatment system, other treatment settings and systems, and among providers with a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. We also present the most current data on the availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications in the USA. These estimates show steady growth in availability of opioid use disorder medications over the past decade and a decline in availability of alcohol use disorder medications. However, overall use of medications in the USA remains low. In 2017, only 16.3% of specialty treatment programs offered any single medication for alcohol use disorder treatment and 35.5% offered any single medication for opioid use disorder treatment. Availability of buprenorphine-waivered providers has increased significantly since 2002. However, geographic disparities in access to buprenorphine remain. Some of the most promising strategies to increase availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications include the following: incorporating substance use disorder training in healthcare education programs, educating the substance use disorder workforce about the benefits of medication treatment, reducing stigma surrounding the use of medications, implementing medications in primary care settings, implementing integrated care models, revising regulations on methadone and buprenorphine, improving health insurance coverage of medications, and developing novel medications for the treatment of substance use disorder.

### Morphine sulfate (Infumorph 200) [^111wNnMF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of INFUMORPH abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing morphine, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use INFUMORPH in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder.

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol) [^115SbBoT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal

The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting VIVITROL treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7–10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with VIVITROL should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with other substance use disorders, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider providing a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting in patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (or who are in treatment for a substance use disorder involving the use of alcohol or other sedative drugs including benzodiazepines or BZRAs). Obtain careful, regular monitoring of patients using alcohol or other sedatives but not meeting the criteria for diagnosis of a specific substance use disorder.

Figure 3
Explanations for risk factors of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder.

A comprehensive evaluation to assess the presence or risk of misuse and opioid use disorder includes questions about patients' history of substance use disorders and current clinical characteristics (e.g. from a physical examination), input from patients' family members and other health care providers (e.g. psychiatrists, previous pain specialists), and pill counts. Behaviors that may indicate increased likelihood of misuse or opioid use disorder include requests for early refills, unauthorized dose escalations, and use of another individual's medication. Substance use disorder is generally associated with one or more of the four "Cs" (i.e. impaired Control over use, Compulsive use, Continued use despite harm, and Craving).

A few simple questions (e.g. single-item screening questions [SISQs] for alcohol and drug use) followed by a discussion with patients is an efficient way for clinicians to incorporate risk assessment into their practice. Reviewing a patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions in the PDMP is another method for assessing potential opioid misuse or substance use disorder. Clinicians should be aware of their state's regulations, recommendations, and resources regarding PDMPs. All states have or are planning to implement a PDMP, but reporting times vary and not every provider is required to participate in PDMPs in all states. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 is intended to improve the efficiency of these programs to track prescription drug use and help prevent inappropriate use. Despite their inconsistencies, PDMPs (when available) have become standard of care as part of patient risk evaluation. Whether PDMP data will predict aberrant behaviors or other adverse outcomes is not yet known and represents a gap in the science and an unmet need.

Question 3: How Often Should UDM Occur in Patients with Low, Medium, and High Risk for Opioid Misuse or Opioid Use Disorder?

Expert Panel Recommendation

Perform UDM at baseline in patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain. During ongoing monitoring, perform UDM at least annually for low-risk patients, two or more times per year for moderate-risk patients, and three or more times per year for high-risk patients. Additional monitoring can be performed at any risk level as frequently as necessary according to clinical judgment.

### Evolving trends in drug overdose mortality in the USA from 2000 to 2020: an age-period-cohort analysis [^115Kk8fL]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The large number of drug-related deaths in the U.S. is a complex social and political issue. To address the rapidly increasing mortality rates, a multi-faceted public health approach is urgently needed. National guidelines for opioid prescription must be reviewed routinely and modified. In 2016 the CDC published a guideline to address the overprescribing of opioid drugs. Since then, the U.S. has seen a decrease in opioid dispensing rate per 100 persons from 70.6 in 2015 to 43.3 in 2020. In 2022, CDC released another Clinical Practice Guideline for prescribing opioids for adult outpatients with pain. However, these guidelines have some limitations as they do not situate prescription opioids within the context of opioid overdose epidemic. Although rates of opioid prescription have declined since 2012 the guideline does not note that the overdose deaths have increased. In addition, these guidelines do not clearly identify the risk of concurrent alcohol use for overdose deaths. Moreover, the guidelines do not address those who are uninsured or in a low-income household who are at higher risk of opioid deaths but for whom opioid pain relief may be the only option for managing chronic pain. Challenges in implementing the guidelines correctly, and barriers to financing alternatives to opioid-based pain relief, have also been identified. Although the newly-released 2022 guidelines make reference to the opioid crisis, they still lack reference to the management of multi-drug use and concomitant alcohol use, give little guidance on balancing patient needs for pain relief with federal rules on prescription limits, and incorporate recommendations for alternative pain-relief strategies that despite identifying that these are supported only by low quality evidence. Further refinement of these guidelines is essential in light of the rapid growth of opioid overdose deaths in the USA.

### Oxycodone (oxycodone hydrochloride) [^115yuk2z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Oxycodone HCl tablets contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxycodone HCl exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxycodone HCl. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxycodone HCl, and reassess all patients receiving oxycodone HCl for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oxycodone HCl, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxycodone HCl along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone HCl. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and on the proper disposal of unused drugs. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Risk factors for prolonged opioid use following total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty: a narrative review of recent literature [^11381nys]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol and Substance Use

Of the 9 studies that reported preoperative alcohol or other substance use disorders (SUDs) as a risk factor for prolonged opioid use, 7 had statistically significant findings. In these studies, RRs ranged from 1.03 to 1.74 for SUDs in general, and 1.1 to 2.2 for alcohol use disorders specifically. When measured over time, studies had conflicting results as to when the RR was at its peak. Two studies reported a peak RR at approximately 5 months postoperative, whereas the other 2 reported peak RR at approximately 1 year postoperative. In this case, it is notable that both studies reporting a peak RR at 5 months were specific to THA patients, while the 2 reporting a peak RR at 1 year were specific to TKA patients. This indicates that THA patients with a history of SUDs potentially are at a higher risk of prolonged opioid use in the short-term, whereas TKA patients with a history of SUDs are potentially at a higher risk of prolonged opioid use in the longer term. Mechanistically, there are a couple of potential reasons explaining alcohol use disorders as a risk factor. First, opioids and alcohol are known to activate similar reward pathways within the brain and do so through their overlapping analgesic and euphoric outcomes. Second, long-term alcohol use can lead to a cycle of short-term analgesia and long-term hyperalgesia, therefore, patients would be able to avoid the unwanted side effects of alcohol withdrawal by consuming opioids.

In summary, 7 of 9 studies found that a history of alcohol or other SUDs was a significant risk factor for prolonged opioid use, with the risk differing between TKA and THA patients over time. Opioid prescriptions should be carefully considered in these patients due to the increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression that can occur with concomitant use of alcohol on top of the increased risk for prolonged opioid use. Risk mitigation strategies and naloxone re-education should also be performed whenever necessary.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112Wp76S]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression; similarly, patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concurrent alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116S7vKf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Co-occurring sedatives/benzodiazepines and level of care — treatment should not be withheld; monitoring and caution are advised: Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and opportunities for treatment retention versus risks of diversion when determining whether treatment in an OTP or OBOT is more suitable. Patients with co-occurring alcohol, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting; however, treatment services should not be withheld if intensive care is not accessible or acceptable, and in these cases, the patient should be carefully monitored. The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend treatment; although combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harms from untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks, so a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted with greater support and careful medication management, and prescribing benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution, particularly for patients prescribed methadone or buprenorphine.

### Alcohol involvement in opioid pain reliever and… [^111yVunS]. CDC (2014). Low credibility.

1, 2). Excessive alcohol consumption also accounts for a significant health burden and is common among groups that report high rates of prescription drug abuse. When taken with OPRs or benzodiazepines, alcohol increases central nervous system depression and the risk for overdose. The analyses showed alcohol was involved in 18. 5% of OPR and
27. 2% of benzodiazepine drug abuse-related ED visits and 22. 1% of OPR and
21. 4% of benzodiazepine drug-related deaths. These findings indicate that alcohol plays a significant role in OPR and benzodiazepine abuse. Interventions to reduce the abuse of alcohol and these drugs alone and in combination are needed. Discussion Alcohol was commonly involved in ED visits resulting from the abuse of OPRs or benzodiazepines as well as in deaths related to these drugs. Nearly one fifth of OPR abuse–related ED visits and more than one fourth of benzodiazepine abuse–related ED visits involved alcohol.

Slightly more than one fifth of drug related deaths involved OPRs and alcohol and the same proportion applied to benzodiazepines and alcohol. Alcohol was more likely to be involved in single-drug class ED visits and deaths involving benzodiazepines compared with OPRs. Alcohol involvement was higher in single-drug class ED visits for benzodiazepines compared with all ED visits involving benzodiazepines as well as single drug-class deaths for both OPRs and benzodiazepines compared with all deaths involving these drugs; this was especially pronounced for the benzodiazepine single-drug class deaths, for which 72. 1% involved alcohol. This finding is consistent with the well characterized increase in central nervous system depression and overdose risk that results when alcohol is combined with these types of substances (.

The fact that approximately one fifth of OPR drug abuse–related ED visits and drug-related deaths involve alcohol suggests the need for stronger prevention measures to mitigate this significant public health problem. OPRs and benzodiazepines are prescribed and dispensed by health care providers, and this presents an opportunity to discuss their risks, especially the serious risk of central nervous system depression when combined with alcohol or other depressants. However, only 16% of adults in the United States have discussed alcohol consumption with a health professional (.
