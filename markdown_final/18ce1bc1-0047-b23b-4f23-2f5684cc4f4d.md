## Question

Something strange with lumps in my neck i want you to diagnose me

Assistant: I'm sorry you're feeling worried about lumps in your neck. While I can provide general health information, I'm not able to diagnose medical conditions. If you'd like to describe your lumps in more detail, such as their size, how quickly they appeared, or any other symptoms, I can guide you on what types of healthcare professionals or resources might be best to consult.

They just appeared last week on the left side of my neck i dont know how many lumps or how big they are i cant see them i just know theyre lumps do i have cancer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether new neck lumps that appeared last week are cancer and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the time course and how that shifts pretest probability. Then, I should verify which clinical features raise or lower suspicion for malignancy. Next, I will consider the most likely benign explanations and when they typically resolve. After that, I need to outline a guideline-based evaluation plan, including when to image and when to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and address the cancer question directly with probabilities and red flags to watch for [^4d7634e4] [^891c90b0].

> Let me first confirm the time frame, because duration is pivotal. These lumps appeared only a week ago, which places them in the acute window where reactive lymphadenopathy from viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections is most common, and malignancy is less likely at onset, though not impossible, so I should not jump to conclusions yet [^4d7634e4] [^696ad3cb].

> Wait, let me verify the malignancy risk features I must check. Firmness, fixation to surrounding tissues, size greater than 1.5 cm, and ulceration of overlying skin increase concern, whereas small, mobile, tender nodes under 1.5 cm are more consistent with benign disease; I should also ask about B symptoms, voice change, dysphagia, otalgia, and weight loss, and I need to remember that tenderness alone does not reliably distinguish benign from malignant nodes, so I should not anchor on pain as reassuring or concerning by itself [^6cf1ced4] [^4d7634e4] [^24d346f5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cancer just because it's a neck mass in an adult. I initially thought "any new neck mass in an adult is cancer until proven otherwise", but wait, I should correct that framing: the adage applies primarily to persistent, noninfectious neck masses, not to acute, recently appeared nodes in the setting of a likely infectious trigger, so I should be cautious and context-specific here [^891c90b0] [^4d7634e4].

> I will now examine the most likely explanation. Given the one-week onset, reactive cervical lymphadenopathy from a recent viral URI or tonsillitis is most probable; nodes often enlarge over days, may be tender, and in many cases begin to regress within 2 to 3 weeks, so I should set expectations for a short interval of observation if there are no red flags and the exam is reassuring [^b88e97d0] [^2a6b0db4].

> Next, I should review the guideline-based next steps. I need to ensure a focused history and physical exam are completed, documenting size, consistency, mobility, and associated symptoms; if there is no clear infectious source and the mass persists beyond about 2 weeks without improvement, or if any high-risk features are present, I should escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the neck and consider fine-needle aspiration, ideally ultrasound-guided, rather than open biopsy, to secure a tissue diagnosis if imaging is suspicious or inconclusive [^4d7634e4] [^891c90b0] [^87cc2124] [^4d2aa481].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating risk because the nodes are painless? I should double-check that painless nodes can still be reactive early on, and that lymphoma can present with rubbery, mobile, painless nodes; however, lymphoma typically evolves over weeks to months and often brings systemic symptoms, so the very short one-week timeline still favors a benign process, though I must remain vigilant if the nodes persist or grow [^3e63274d] [^696ad3cb].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. If there are no red flags and the exam shows small, mobile nodes under 1.5 cm, I would observe for 2 to 3 weeks, avoid antibiotics unless there are clear signs of bacterial infection, and arrange follow-up to ensure resolution; if the nodes persist beyond 2 weeks, enlarge, become firm or fixed, or if new concerning symptoms arise, I would obtain contrast-enhanced neck imaging and proceed to ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration as indicated, with ENT referral for a targeted head and neck exam including direct visualization of the upper aerodigestive tract if malignancy risk is elevated [^4d7634e4] [^e4254e76] [^87cc2124] [^11ef560b].

> I should confirm the bottom line about cancer risk. With only a one-week history and no described red flags, the likelihood of malignancy is low but not zero; most new neck masses in adults are benign when they appear acutely, yet persistent nodes beyond 2 weeks without improvement warrant a structured cancer workup, so the key is timely follow-up and escalation if the story changes [^4d7634e4] [^891c90b0] [^696ad3cb].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and safety netting. I will advise monitoring for fever, night sweats, weight loss, voice change, dysphagia, or progressive enlargement, and I will document a concrete follow-up plan; if uncertainty remains or anxiety is high, earlier imaging can be reasonable, but I should avoid reflex antibiotics in the absence of infection to prevent delays in diagnosis and unnecessary treatment [^2a6b0db4] [^7ac6abf3] [^5e82944b].

I can't diagnose you, but I can guide you on next steps. New neck lumps that appear over a week are most often due to **benign causes** such as reactive lymph nodes from a recent infection, but **cancer is possible** — especially if the lumps are hard, fixed, larger than 1.5 cm, or persist beyond 2–3 weeks without shrinking [^4d7634e4] [^696ad3cb]. You should **see a doctor within 1–2 weeks** for a focused exam and to decide if imaging or biopsy is needed [^4d7634e4] [^891c90b0]. In the meantime, track size, tenderness, and any new symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, voice changes, or trouble swallowing) and seek urgent care if you develop breathing difficulty, rapidly enlarging masses, or severe pain [^2a6b0db4] [^2b63b43d].

---

## Possible causes of neck lumps

Neck lumps have a broad differential; the most common include:

- **Reactive lymphadenopathy**: Benign enlargement from viral or bacterial infections (e.g. strep, mononucleosis, upper respiratory infections) [^b88e97d0] [^3e63274d].
- **Inflammatory or autoimmune conditions**: Such as sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis [^b3a5f436].
- **Benign neoplasms**: Lipomas, branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, or epidermal inclusion cysts [^b0355a9c].
- **Malignant neoplasms**: Lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, or metastases from other sites [^891c90b0] [^3e63274d].

Given the **one-week timeline**, reactive lymphadenopathy is most likely, but malignancy cannot be excluded without evaluation [^4d7634e4].

---

## Red flag symptoms suggesting malignancy

Certain features increase concern for cancer and warrant **prompt evaluation**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Duration | Persistent > 2–3 weeks without regression [^4d7634e4] [^696ad3cb] |
| Consistency | Hard, firm, or rubbery [^6cf1ced4] [^24d346f5] |
| Mobility | Fixed or non-mobile [^6cf1ced4] [^3e63274d] |
| Size | > 1.5 cm [^6cf1ced4] [^75308b51] |
| Associated symptoms | - Voice change <br/> - Dysphagia <br/> - Odynophagia <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Fever > 101°F [^2b63b43d] [^4d7634e4] |
| Risk factors | - Smoking <br/> - Alcohol use <br/> - Family history of head and neck cancer <br/> - Immunosuppression [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess duration, growth, symptoms, and risk factors; examine size, consistency, mobility, and inspect the oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx [^d1e313cd] [^11ef560b].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is first-line for characterizing lymph nodes; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated if malignancy is suspected or if the mass persists beyond 2–3 weeks [^37354c20] [^891c90b0].
- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Preferred initial tissue diagnosis for suspicious or persistent masses; avoids open biopsy when possible [^e4254e76] [^4d2aa481].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, and targeted serologies (e.g. EBV, HIV) as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and treatment options

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Benign reactive lymphadenopathy**: Typically resolves spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying infection; excellent prognosis [^2a6b0db4].
- **Lymphoma**: Highly curable with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; prognosis varies by subtype and stage [^537d6ff6].
- **Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma**: Early-stage disease has 5-year survival rates of 80–90%, which drop significantly with advanced disease; early detection is critical [^notfound].
- **Thyroid cancer**: Generally favorable prognosis, especially papillary and follicular variants, with high long-term survival rates [^notfound].

Treatment is **cause-specific**: antibiotics for bacterial infections, surgical excision for benign cysts or tumors, and multimodal therapy (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) for malignancies [^e4254e76] [^537d6ff6].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Seek **urgent care** if you experience:

- Rapidly enlarging mass
- Severe pain or tenderness
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing
- Fever > 101°F with systemic symptoms
- Signs of airway compromise (stridor, drooling, inability to handle secretions)

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

While new neck lumps are often benign, **persistent or atypical features require evaluation**. Given your one-week history, observe for changes over the next 1–2 weeks, but **schedule a doctor's visit** if the lumps persist, grow, or develop red flags. Early, guideline-based assessment with imaging and FNA when indicated provides the best chance for timely diagnosis and cure if cancer is present [^4d7634e4] [^891c90b0].

### Lumps and bumps: late postsurgical inflammatory and infectious lesions [^9370124b]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Late postsurgical infectious or inflammatory complications after facial surgery present a difficult challenge. These complications occur at least 2 weeks after surgical procedures and are often attributable to unique causes, in contrast to complications within the first postoperative week. The most worrisome complications in this period are caused by mycobacterial infections, because these infections can be severe and require a protracted treatment course. A high degree of suspicion is required early in presentation because these lesions can be subtle and similar to other infectious or inflammatory lesions. The authors discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnostic and treatment rationale for late postoperative infectious and inflammatory lesions. The authors also demonstrate and compare the clinical manifestations of mycobacterial infections, bacterial infections, and sterile inflammatory reactions. In addition, the treatment rationale for mycobacterial infections is reviewed. Late postoperative infections caused by mycobacteria are reported with increasing frequency in the cosmetic literature. These cases illustrate diverse challenges in the identification and treatment of late postoperative lesions.

Case presentation

A female patient in her 30s with a history of exercise-induced asthma noted a worsening chronic cough for the last 6 months. She was treated twice with a fluticasone inhaler, oral prednisone and benzonatate pearls with no improvement. She was evaluated by otolaryngology, where she underwent nasal flexible laryngoscopy, which was normal. Later on, a trial of pantoprazole was started for 6 weeks, which resulted in improvement of her symptoms. On this follow-up office visit, the patient noticed new symptoms, including worsening shortness of breath and new onset dysphagia, in addition to a lump on the left side of her neck for a few weeks. The lump was not painful, and there was no change in size. She denied infectious symptoms. The patient has a family history of thyroid cancer. She is not a smoker. On the physical exam, she had a palpable left neck mass, lateral to the thyroid and into the supraclavicular region, measuring approximately 1.5×2 cm.

Neck pain is a common and costly problem in Western society. Nearly two-thirds of the US population will experience neck pain at some point in their lives, and at any one time about 5% of the US population has sufficient neck pain to cause disability. Although the likelihood of defining a precise cause of neck pain is low, if the etiology and structural source can be determined, they may be valuable in directing treatment. Patient history serves to identify red flags and yellow flags, whereas the physical examination, guided by the history, serves primarily to confirm those suspicions.

### A child in shock: carotid blowout syndrome [^dca64481]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Paediatricians commonly encounter neck lumps during their routine clinical practice; vascular abnormalities, such as (pseudo)aneurysms, are a rare cause of these. Pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery in children are usually the result of blunt or penetrating trauma, infection or vasculitis/connective tissue disorders. They can present with a variety of symptoms including neck pain, as a pulsatile neck mass or with compressive symptoms (for example, cranial nerve palsies or dyspnoea). Pseudoaneurysms carry a risk of rupture in which case they are fatal, unless immediate treatment is provided.We report a 17-month-old male child with idiopathic carotid artery blowout syndrome presenting with acute oropharyngeal haemorrhage leading to asystolic cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and emergency embolisation controlled the bleeding. Despite extensive left hemispheric infarct, he has survived.Carotid artery blowout syndrome needs to be recognised as a potential cause of major haemorrhage in childhood. The purpose of this case report is to remind readers of the differential diagnosis and work-up of a child presenting with a neck lump, to highlight important aspects of the acute management of major haemorrhage and massive blood transfusion in paediatrics, to describe the aetiology, presentation and management of carotid artery pseudoaneurysm in children and to discuss long term rehabilitation in patients with consequent neurological sequelae (including the need for input from multiple specialty teams).

Case presentation

A 54-year-old woman presented to the outpatient ear, nose and throat neck lump clinic with a 2-week history of multiple bilateral neck lumps. These painless lumps had been progressively enlarging over a 2-week period. She had also been having episodes of night sweats but she felt these were related to her menopause. She had not noticed any other lumps around her body. She denied any weight loss and had no head and neck red flag symptoms or B-type symptoms. Additionally, she had no recent viral illness.

Thirteen years prior to presentation, she had bilateral breast augmentation with silicone-based implants. Three years following insertion, her silicone implants were recalled by the manufacturer and were replaced with saline-based implants. On removal, there was no evidence of implant rupture or leakage. She had no other relevant medical history. She was a non-smoker and consumed five units of alcohol per week.

On examination, she had multiple bilateral palpable lymph nodes in levels IV and Vb, more prominent on the left. A flexible nasoendoscopy and oral cavity examination were unremarkable. At this stage, the differential diagnosis included lymphoma, head and neck cancer, metastases and reactive lymphadenopathy secondary to infection.

Saxenda® and Victoza®—safety and contraindications are emphasized as follows: The risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) has been rarely associated with Saxenda® and Victoza®. If you have had pancreatitis in the past, these medications may not be the right medication, and you should notify the doctor is you have any history of problems with your pancreas. Symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in your upper stomach area which may travel to your back and may worsen after eating, stomach area may be tender to the touch, and vomiting, nausea and/or fever. If you should develop any of these symptoms, stop the Saxenda or Victoza and contact your doctor, and they will do a blood test to check for pancreatitis. Saxenda® and Victoza® has been associated with thyroid cancer in animal studies, and you should not use Saxenda® and Victoza® if you have a history of certain types of thyroid cancers or if you have a family history of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome. Notify your doctor if you develop a lump on your neck, hoarseness (unusual change in your voice), difficulty swallowing or breathing.

### Recurrent deeply invasive basal cell carcinoma [^674ff192]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent skin malignancy worldwide. The majority of BCCs grow slowly and have a low metastatic potential. However, they can be destructive to surrounding tissues since they are locally invasive.

Methods

This case report was conducted on a 78-year-old woman complaining of a solid lump on the left side of the neck and nonhealing lesion. Three years earlier, she had BCC on the same site. Clinical and radiographic examinations were made. The biopsy specimens revealed that it is a recurrent BCC. In operating room, during blunt tissue dissection, the arterial wall was damaged. Tumor was overgrown left internal carotid artery near the bifurcation. Infiltrated part of arteria wall was resected, and a synthetic arterial prosthesis was placed.

Results

Follow-up after 4 months showed that the wound was healing well. No complications regarding cardiovascular and other organ systems were seen.

### Silicone granuloma: a cause of cervical lymphadenopathy following breast implantation [^9746f2c4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with saline-based breast implants who presented to the ear, nose and throat neck lump clinic with a 2-week history of bilateral neck lumps. She was found to have multiple palpable cervical lymph nodes bilaterally in levels IV and Vb. The ultrasonography demonstrated multiple lymph nodes with the snowstorm sign and a core biopsy confirmed a silicone granuloma (siliconoma). This granuloma was likely caused by bleeding gel from the silicone shell of her saline-based implants. This case demonstrates the importance of bleeding gel from saline-based implants, in the absence of implant rupture. Thus, head and neck specialists should consider siliconomas as a cause for cervical lymphadenopathy in patients with saline-based breast implants.

Neck mass in adults—suspicious history criteria: Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration; Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. Supporting details state that in the setting of a neck mass without recent infection, the clinician should establish the duration, that a noninfectious neck mass present ≥2 weeks without signs of improvement is concerning for malignancy, that unknown duration should be considered a persistent mass at increased risk for malignancy, and that the mere presence of a neck mass present ≥2 weeks without signs of improvement is suspicious even without other risk factors.

### Phenotype standardization of angioedema in the head and neck region caused by agents acting on the angiotensin system [^80c853ef]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Angioedema induced by an ACE inhibitor develops in areas of loose connective tissue over about 4–6 h and usually resolves in 24–48 h.The face, lips, tongue, floor of the mouth, and upper airways are most often affected, and the swelling may be asymmetrical. Symptoms such as a lump in the throat, hoarse voice, and difficulties in swallowing and breathing are signs of impending airway obstruction. ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema rarely presents with urticaria or swelling outside the head and neck region, although gastrointestinal and genital angioedema have been reported. There are no obvious differences in symptoms of angioedema induced by ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Supplementary Table S2 online describes further information to be requested with regard to the reaction.

Risk factors

Minor local trauma, surgical procedures, and dental treatment may trigger angioedema during ACE inhibitor treatment. Smoking and a history of ACE inhibitor–induced cough have also been identified as risk factors.Other risk factors include female gender, African-American ethnicity, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and a history of drug rash and seasonal allergies (Table 1). Due to the rarity of angioedema induced by ARBs, knowledge about risk factors is poor.Neither sex nor age has been identified as a risk factor.

### Risk factors and time to symptomatic presentation in leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma [^50ecf2e2]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Interpretation and implications for practice

‘Not realising symptom(s) were serious' was a clear risk factor for waiting >3 months before presentation and has been previously reported in patients with haematological malignancies. This may occur because many of the symptoms (e.g. fatigue, lymphadenopathy and bone pain), are common in the general population and often benign and self-limiting. Patients may justify such symptoms: fatigue may be considered a natural consequence of aging; lymphadenopathy may be attributed to localised infection (if around the neck) or a hernia (if in the groin); and bone pain to age-related ‘wear and tear'. The same may occur for other rarer symptoms, such as genuine drenching night sweats, which might be attributed by women to expected menopausal symptoms. This process of ‘normalising' symptoms has been reported in other studies and is thought to be associated with prolonged time to help seeking.

A further factor that may lead patients to conclude that their symptoms are not serious, and result in them waiting longer before seeking help, is the patients' expectations of what cancer might be like. For example, they may expect symptoms to be painful, constant, associated with a feeling of ill health and gradually becoming worse. However, a previous study of lymphoma reported that patients often experienced abnormal lumps that were intermittent and painless and were not associated with feelings of ill health or progression; alternatively, patients also reported unexplained malaise, with no additional symptoms. These symptoms led patients to believe they had self-limiting, benign illnesses, rather than cancer. Also, despite some symptoms being indicative of individual subtypes, these may be varied and a clear ‘symptom signature' (such as a breast lump in breast cancer) does not exist. There is also a lack of awareness about these diseases, and the range and combination of symptoms that may accompany them, among the general public.

Neck mass follow-up patient handout—adults are instructed on self-monitoring and when to seek care, including “If you were given antibiotics, take them as prescribed,” “Once each week, check the size of the neck mass using your fingertips,” and “Follow up with your provider to be sure that the neck mass decreases in size over time.” The handout explains that “The mass should get smaller over time. A mass due to infection should go away completely or return to a much smaller size, typically in 2 or 3 weeks.” Patients are told to “Contact your provider if” the mass gets larger, does not go away completely, or goes away but then comes back, and to “Notify your provider if you have” symptoms such as “Fever >101°F.” For follow-up methods, “You and your provider may stay in contact by phone, through electronic messages, by mail, or in person at the provider’s office. You may need to go back to your provider’s office for a repeat examination.” It emphasizes, “No matter how you follow up with your provider, be sure that the mass has gone away. If the mass does not go away, your provider will help you decide what to do next.”

### Gnathostomiasis acquired by British tourists in Botswana [^13d0359d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The Cases

The first person evaluated for possible gnathostomiasis was a British Caucasian man, 41 years of age, who came to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) in London on September 30, 2008, 3 weeks after his return from the Okavango Delta in Botswana. He had been camping, walking barefoot, and swimming in and drinking river water. On several occasions, he had also eaten raw bream. About 2 weeks later, he reported intermittent abdominal discomfort, which was localized, but each morning, the pain moved to a different site and was accompanied by a palpable swelling over his spleen that resolved after 12 days. Pruritus then developed under his left arm and, within 24 hours, a painful subcutaneous lump developed on his anterior chest wall.

When he arrived at HTD, he was systemically well but had a raised nontender erythematous lesion below his left axilla. His eosinophil count was slightly high, 0.69 × 10 9 cells/L (reference count <0.4 × 10 9 cells/L).

A presumptive diagnosis of migratory helminthic infection was made (gnathostomiasis or larval cestode infection), and he was treated with ivermectin, 200 μg/kg as a single dose, and albendazole, 400 mg 2×/d for 21 days. A week later, the lesion had migrated to his neck, but within 14 days, the lesion and eosinophilia had resolved. His initial serologic test result was negative for Gnathostoma spp. A subsequent sample was also negative, which may indicate that the antibody response had not developed sufficiently or that results were outside the sensitivity range.

### Low-back and neck pain diagnosis and treatment [^c4807d78]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Back and neck pain are symptoms, often complaints, and sometimes causes of disability, but they are not diseases. These distinctions are critical to understanding the personal and societal impact of back and neck pain and our opportunities to discover new ways to reduce their impact. This article briefly describes current diagnosis and treatment of spinal pain, the relationship between pain and disability, and the challenges in prioritizing our resource allocations between curing pain problems and reducing disability.

The Study

On August 3, 2012, fever developed in a previously healthy 63-year-old woman who lived in Chuncheon-si, Gangwon Province, South Korea; the same day, she noticed a lump on the left side of her neck. She visited a local clinic, and ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were started on the first day of illness. The patient reported that, 2 weeks before her fever started, she noticed an insect bite on her neck while she was working on a crop farm in Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon Province (in the northernmost part of South Korea). She did not recall having contact with any domestic animals on the farm and had no history of travel outside South Korea in the month before illness onset.

On the third day of her illness, she began having watery diarrhea, 6 times per day. On the fourth day of the illness, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were recorded at the local clinic (Table). Because of worsening thrombocytopenia, she was transferred to another hospital. Ciprofloxacin was changed to doxycycline, and ceftriaxone was continued. A computed tomography scan of the neck showed an enlarged (1.6 cm), necrotic lymph node. Multiple lymph nodes on the left cervical and left axillary areas were also swollen. On the sixth day, the patient was transferred to Seoul National University Hospital.

Communication of patients and GPs about the reason for encounter

All interviewees were familiar with the term “neck pain” and most patients used it regularly to describe their complaints. However, most preferred to additionally describe the pain in detail, specifying the affected region or naming co-symptoms; and they reported to do so when talking with their families and friends. However, some patients did not use any medical terminology but referred to their pain in concrete or metaphoric terms such as “stiff neck” or “cannot turn my head” even when consulting their GP or a specialist.

Well, as I just said, it was more like the lower back was worse, and when the upper region was also affected, I had more of an impression that it was around the shoulders and then I also mentioned the shoulder pain and not the neck pain so much. (ID 0069, 47-year-old female).

No, I would also say neck pain! OK, very well, let’s say… erm, erm, yes, neck. Yes I’ve still got a stiff neck, but I know that my spine is, erm, very very straight. I’ve been to an orthopaedic specialist, and he said that, erm—very often, I’ll say ‘I’ve got a stiff neck again today’ that’s for sure…’ a stiff neck again today’ as you say… (ID 0198, 61-year-old female).

Evaluation of the neck mass in adults—strength of action terms and implied obligations are defined for three categories. Strong recommendation indicates that benefits clearly exceed harms with high-quality supporting evidence (grade A or B), and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation indicates that benefits exceed harms but the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option indicates that evidence quality may be suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage among approaches, and clinicians should be flexible in decision making, potentially setting bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Tracheal rupture as a result of coughing [^f144990c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Tracheal rupture is mostly traumatic or iatrogenic. A few cases of spontaneous tracheal rupture have been reported in literatüre and all of them have been described posterior membraneous wall which is the weakest portion of trachea. In most of such cases, predisposing factors that weaken the tracheal structure were present. We presented the first case of spontaneous anterolateral tracheal rupture as a result of coughing that caused no respiratory distress and that spontaneously recovered without any complications. A 24 year old male presented to the emergency department with sore throat. After eating chicken shawarma, the patient felt a lump in his throat and coughed. After coughing, a tearing like and severe pain developed at his neck's front region radiating to his shoulders and back. On past medical history, the patient had no known diseases and had no history of use of medications. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for neck tenderness. Pneumomediastinum, free air within the cervical fascias and a 4mm tracheal mural defect on the left anterolateral side at the level superior to the manubrium was observed in computerised tomography scan of neck and chest. The patient had no shortness of breath and therefore urgent surgery was not considered. Increase in free air was not seen in the control x-rays 6 hours later. The patient with a foriegn nationality left the emergency at his own will. He was contacted one month later via telephone. The patient said that his neck pain subsided and had no other complaints.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^696ad3cb]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^891c90b0]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common. Currently, there is only 1 evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Additionally, much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. In addition, although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes. Specific goals include reducing delays in diagnosis of HNSCC; promoting appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies; reducing inappropriate testing; and promoting appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected. The target patient for this guideline is anyone ≥18 years old with a neck mass. The target clinician for this guideline is anyone who may be the first clinician whom a patient with a neck mass encounters. This includes clinicians in primary care, dentistry, and emergency medicine, as well as pathologists and radiologists who have a role in diagnosing neck masses. This guideline does not apply to children. This guideline addresses the initial broad differential diagnosis of a neck mass in an adult. However, the intention is only to assist the clinician with a basic understanding of the broad array of possible entities. The intention is not to direct management of a neck mass known to originate from thyroid, salivary gland, mandibular, or dental pathology as management recommendations for these etiologies already exist. This guideline also does not address the subsequent management of specific pathologic entities, as treatment recommendations for benign and malignant neck masses can be found elsewhere. Instead, this guideline is restricted to addressing the appropriate work-up of an adult patient with a neck mass that may be malignant in order to expedite diagnosis and referral to a head and neck cancer specialist. The Guideline Development Group sought to craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass. Furthermore, where possible, the Guideline Development Group incorporated evidence to promote high-quality and cost-effective care. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (or magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. The development group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy because the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. (2) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size >1.5 cm, or ulceration of overlying skin. (3) Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for patients with a neck mass to identify those with other suspicious findings that represent an increased risk for malignancy. (4) For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. (5) For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. (6) Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. (7) Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. (8) For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. (9) Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is deemed at increased risk for malignancy who does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. (10) Clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. The development group recommended against clinicians routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection.

Case presentation

A 4-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital in November 2014 with a large, painful and worsening mass (about 20 × 23 cm) on the left side of the neck (Fig. 1). From her past medical history, she initially presented in December 2012 (then aged 2) with a 1-month history of the parents noticing a red left eye and decreased vision. She was found to have cells in the anterior chamber, iris nodules, vitreous opacities and secondary glaucoma. The right eye was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed left intraocular soft tissue density mass lesions with specks of calcifications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a left intraocular mass that was hyperintense relative to the vitreous on T1WI and markedly hypointense relative to the vitreous on axial T2WI (Fig. 2a). Depending on the calcification, demonstrated well with contrast administration and thin sections with fat suppression, a diagnosis of retinoblastoma stage E was made. There was no positive family history. Enucleation was proposed but was refused by the girl’s parents. After 1 year (in December 2013), the patient presented with periocular oedema and conjunctival chemosis for 3 months. She had been enucleated in another hospital. The CT and MRI before operation are shown in Fig. 2b. Histopathological examination revealed the retinoblastoma and showed that tumour cells had invaded the sclera, but tumour cells were not found at the end of the optic nerve. She did not receive any chemical or radiological treatment after the operation. In May 2014, the patient presented with a growing mass in the left orbit and small hard lump of the left side of the neck (Fig. 2c). Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the lump was performed, and it was found positive for tumour deposits of retinoblastoma cells in a local hospital. The parents refused chemotherapy once more due to poor financial situation. After 6 months, the patient presented again because the mass of the left side of the neck was growing too large and painful to tolerate (Fig. 2d). A multidepartment collaboration mode of treatment was applied, which involved surgery, postoperative chemotherapy and/or additional local radiotherapy.

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^b0dd0548]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck pain—risk factors and guideline recommendations—Clinicians should consider age greater than 40, coexisting low back pain, a long history of neck pain, cycling as a regular activity, loss of strength in the hands, worrisome attitude, poor quality of life, and less vitality as predisposing factors for the development of chronic neck pain (Recommendation based on moderate evidence). Evidence from 2 recent systematic reviews indicates that the female sex and prior history of neck pain are the strongest and most consistent risk factors for new-onset neck pain in office workers and the general population, while older age, high job demands, smoking history, low social/work support, and prior history of low back pain may also be risk factors.

### Modern approach to the neck mass [^4d2aa481]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Neck mass is a common first sign of malignancy in adult patients. Timely diagnosis can prevent disease progression. Initial evaluation of a neck mass includes creating a plan for obtaining further diagnostic information such as through imaging and tissue diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be done with or without ultrasound (US) guidance and is commonly done as an alternative to core biopsy and open biopsy. The accuracy of US-guided FNA has been shown to supersede that of palpation-guided FNA. Moreover, in-office US-guided FNA has become more accessible over time and can improve time to diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and evaluation-AAFP (...) [^24d346f5]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example, the child who presents with a sore throat, tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test, or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases, the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings, and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. 1 Lymphadenopathy refers to nodes that are abnormal in either size, consistency or number. There are various classifications of lymphadenopathy, but a simple and clinically useful system is to classify lymphadenopathy as “generalized” if lymph nodes are enlarged in two or more noncontiguous areas or “localized” if only one area is involved. If lymph nodes are detected, the following five characteristics should be noted and described: Size.

Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0. 5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than
1. 5 cm should be considered abnormal. 7, 8 Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. Pain/Tenderness. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of tenderness does not reliably differentiate benign from malignant nodes.
4. Consistency. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant.

The term “shotty” refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. Although rarely present, a paraumbilical node may be a sign of an abdominal or pelvic neoplasm. 12 In patients with generalized lymphadenopathy, the physical examination should focus on searching for signs of systemic illness. The most helpful findings are rash, mucous membrane lesions, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or arthritis.

Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment, less frequent practice variation is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation while options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, clinicians should always act to best serve their patients’ interests regardless of guideline recommendations, and the role for patient preference depends on the strength of clinical evidence behind each statement.

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^c8580415]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases. "I tried to unveil the stillness of existence through a counteracting murmur of words, and, above all, I confused things with their names: that is belief." Jean-Paul Sartre (The Words, 1964).

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^df75f461]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 9—ancillary tests for adult neck mass: Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient’s history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is at increased risk for malignancy and/or does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging, with recommendation based on nonconsecutive studies, observational studies, case series, and panel consensus with preponderance of benefit over harm. The decision to obtain any of these tests should be based on the clinician’s clinical suspicion for a particular disease, it is not recommended that these tests be obtained in patients for whom there is no clinical suspicion, and for patients who are at increased risk, ancillary testing should be performed simultaneously with the malignancy workup to avoid delayed cancer diagnosis. Quality improvement opportunity is to identify laboratory or other test that can aid in neck mass diagnosis; aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence is Medium; benefits include diagnosing the neck mass and avoiding invasive procedures/anesthesia; risks include direct costs of ancillary tests, false-positive tests, incidental findings, and risk of failure to diagnose concurrent malignancy based on these test results; benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; and policy level is Recommendation.

### Intractable localized pruritus as the sole manifestation of intramedullary tumor in a child: case report and review of the literature [^b50fcebd]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Persistent localized pruritus is a rare manifestation of central nervous system tumors. Delayed diagnosis can lead to devastating complications.

Observations

We report an otherwise healthy 19-month-old girl who presented with signs of localized intractable pruritus of 6 months' duration on the left side of the neck, shoulder, and arm, resistant to systemic antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. Findings from skin biopsy, viral culture for varicella-zoster virus, and skin prick test to common food and animal allergens were nondiagnostic. Neurologic examination results were unremarkable. After several months of localized intractable pruritus, magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast was performed, which revealed an intramedullary spinal cord tumor extending from just above the foramen magnum to C6. The tumor was surgically resected and found to be a ganglioglioma. Within a week after the surgery her pruritus completely resolved.

Conclusions and Relevance

We recommend a detailed neurologic examination in any case of persistent localized pruritus, in the absence of primary dermatologic causes. Given the challenges of performing a reliable neurologic examination in children, neuroimaging might be considered in children with intractable localized pruritus of unknown etiology of the head and neck or upper extremity, even in the absence of focal neurologic deficits.

### Global, regional, and national burden of neck pain, 1990-2020, and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^f99e6b6b]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

GBD 2019 found neck pain ranked 11th out of the 369 conditions in terms of YLDs.Given this ongoing high global burden, with neck pain featuring in the leading causes of YLDs since 1990, it is disappointing that effective prevention and management interventions have not been forthcoming,and we still do not understand all the determinants and risk factors. Lack of leadership at country and global levels towards implementation of specific musculoskeletal health strategies has probably contributed to minimal prioritisation of musculoskeletal disorders among policy makers and thereby funders and primary health-care practitioners.Potential reasons are that neck pain is not a homogeneous condition or single disease but rather the symptom state associated with a broad range of conditions, and each person has their own unique experience with their pain. Causes of neck (and low back) pain might be unknown and have not been well defined in population estimates and might include muscle strain (including bad sleeping posture, repetitive movements or injury, carrying of heavy goods, and wearing of heavy loads in the neck region); inflammatory and degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs, joints, ligaments, and nerves; or a non-catastrophic injury from a motor vehicle collision, work-related or sports-related event, or degenerative condition (eg, secondary osteoarthritis of cervical facet joints or degenerative cervical myelopathy).It is also possible the heterogeneity of the clinical course should be reconceptualised as both a tissue-based and stress-based interaction where individual diatheses influence the interaction between inherent vulnerability and environmental stressors. By endorsing the concept of diatheses, we encourage recognition that no two people will respond the same to their neck pain. Whether those responses are driven by the pain experience, genetics, microbiome, life experiences, cultural beliefs and pressures, or (more likely) some contribution from all of these, the challenge for clinicians and researchers is to work beyond their typical academic boundaries to find points of convergence that can start to unravel what continues to be a burdensome and recalcitrant problem: acute and chronic neck pain.

### Broadening risk factor or disease definition as a driver for overdiagnosis: a narrative review [^bb3074f7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The approach described above poses a risk of harm, including increased exposure to radiation and the possibility of leading to incidental findings—named ‘incidentalomas’—especially with techniques that provide more detailed images, such as computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. Incidentalomas constitute a potential source of anxiety and concern for patients, especially when the physician does not correctly explain its meaning or, as it so frequently happens, promotes further investigations, specialist referrals and more intensive and often unnecessary medical or surgical procedures. Disc abnormalities, such as degenerative disc disease or bulging disc, are commonly described in imaging exams, although they may not be the cause of pain since they are also seen in up to 97% of asymptomatic patients. To complicate this problem, there is a very marked variation in the interpretation of imaging in LBP, even from the same radiologist.

A paradigmatic example of overdiagnosis occurred in South Korea between 1999 and 2008, with a steep increase in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer, because of a government‐funded national cancer screening program, which led to the widespread use of thyroid ultrasound in asymptomatic people. Consequently, the incidence of papillary thyroid cancers increased 15 fold, whereas the mortality rate remained unchanged (Fig. 1). In this context, it is estimated that 99.7%–99.9% of all thyroid cancers diagnosed in South Korea represent overdiagnosis, mostly of small papillary tumours. Whereas in the past, most thyroid cancers were diagnosed in patients who presented with symptoms related to compression caused by nodules, visible neck masses, or through regular physical examinations, the advent of neck ultrasonography and ultrasound‐guided biopsy allowed detection and biopsy of nodules as small as 2 mm. Wider and increased use of advanced and more sensible imaging technology for other indications, such as CT and magnetic resonance, has also contributed to the rise in incidence, allowing the incidental finding of even smaller nodules. In fact, in the United States, approximately 16% of CT and magnetic resonance images show incidental thyroid nodules, of which around three quarters are <15 mm.

### Improving adherence to guidelines for spine pain care: what tools could support primary care clinicians in conforming to guidelines? [^d48f4571]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Profiles of the 40 PCCs recruited and interviewed for this study are presented in table 1.

Table 1 
Characteristics of PCC interviewees

Four key themes, described below, were found in the analysis of the interview transcripts. A summary of themes can be found in table 2.

Table 2 
Summary of themes

Clinical guideline recommendations too general to guide treatment decisions

Most of the PCCs (29 of the 40 or 73%) reported that they were generally aware of guideline recommendations for conservative care of spine pain but were not influenced by them in making treatment decisions. Participants saw guidelines as too general to be applied to individual patients. One internist stated, ‘ The guidelines are just not flexible enough for these spine patients. No two of them are alike. I have to use my judgement and experience in selecting treatment for them ’. Another stated, ‘ I think we have an algorithm for when to do an MRI of the spine. I glanced at that once, but usually I just use my gut … to decide. I know I should follow algorithms, but sometimes just judgement is a good thing ’.

Research evidence for low-intensity care is not clear and not convincing

The clinicians were also uncertain that sufficient evidence supports conservative care recommendations. While some (24 of the 40 or 60%) indicated conservative care might have some evidence of positive short-term outcomes, there was more concern about lack of evidence from real-world studies for long-term outcomes. An internist suggested ‘long-term there is almost no difference whatsoever… other than related to secondary financial gain or medical legal issues ’. A family practitioner commented that ‘aggressive treatment may get them to pain relief sooner and beyond that we just don’t know ’.

PCCs indicated that real-world outcome evidence could help them to persuade patients to accept conservative care. One family practitioner stated, ‘ if there was a study that would show it doesn’t really make a difference, if you go through all these tests and studies and take all these medicines, and you end up the same way… then that would probably be beneficial ’. An internist commented that ‘ it would be useful to have… some evidence-based scientific paper on back or neck pain long-term outcomes that I could quote to patients ’.

### Evaluation of neck masses in adults-AAFP (...) [^3e63274d]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

The primary concern in adults with a persistent neck mass is malignancy. Fortunately, a history and physical examination coupled with an organized diagnostic evaluation typically reveal a definitive diagnosis. When the etiology is elusive, a head and neck surgeon should be consulted. ACUTE NECK MASSES Neck masses that appear over a short period are generally symptomatic. Blunt or sharp trauma may damage tissue and vasculature, creating a hematoma. Small hematomas are typically self-limited, but large, rapidly expanding hematomas require immediate intervention and possible surgical exploration. Similar mechanisms of trauma, plus the addition of shearing forces, potentiate the formation of pseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas characterized by soft, pulsatile masses with a thrill or bruit. Computed tomography angiography delineates the extent of any possible vascular injury, and treatment is usually surgical ligation.

SUBACUTE NECK MASSES Subacute masses are noticed within weeks to months. Although these masses might grow somewhat quickly, they often go unnoticed at onset because of their asymptomatic nature. A persistent asymptomatic neck mass in an adult should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. 6 Because delayed diagnosis contributes to decreased survival in conditions such as laryngeal cancer, it is paramount for family physicians to recognize common presentations of head and neck cancers. 7, 8. 1 These tumors are unilateral, asymptomatic, slow-growing, mobile masses, in contrast to malignant tumors, which may have rapid growth, skin fixation, pain, or cranial nerve involvement. 1, 11 An intraparotid or isolated pre-auricular lymph node is another diagnostic possibility. The neck is a common area for lymphoma to present as a painless lymph node that may grow rapidly, and subsequently become painful.

Early constitutional symptoms often precede development of diffuse lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. In comparison to lymph nodes associated with metastatic disease characterized above, those associated with lymphoma are usually rubbery, soft, and mobile. 16 Patients may describe a discrete, tender, erythematous mass, which often coincides with recurrent upper respiratory symptoms. Dermoid cysts, typically located in the submental triangle, are soft, doughy, painless masses that enlarge with entrapment of epithelium in deeper tissue and are less prevalent than thyroglossal or branchial cleft cysts. 16.

### The adult neck mass (...) [^b0355a9c]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

When an adult patient presents with a neck mass, malignancy is the greatest concern. Although differentiating benign and malignant masses can be difficult, a methodical approach will usually result in an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This article reviews the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adults and provides a framework for clinical decision-making. Normal Anatomy Accurate diagnosis of a neck mass requires a knowledge of normal structures. With practice and experience, normal variations in anatomy can be distinguished from true pathology without the need for additional diagnostic testing or subspecialist consultation. Lymph nodes are located throughout the head and neck region and are the most common sites of neck masses. Fixed, firm, or matted lymph nodes and nodes larger than 1. 5 cm require further evaluation. For initial assessment and serial examination, the size of the mass may be measured using calipers or a tape measure.

Typical and atypical mycobacterial infections are less common infectious causes of neck masses. Mycobacterial infection generally presents as a single enlarged node that is rarely tender or painful. Tuberculous infection generally presents in older patients with a history of tuberculosis exposure and a positive purified protein derivative tuberculin skin test. Therapy with antituberculous antibiotics for six to 12 months is the treatment of choice. METABOLIC, IDIOPATHIC, AND AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS Kimura's disease is an uncommon chronic inflammatory condition involving subcutaneous tissue. The etiology is unknown. The disease presents as a tumor-like lesion with a predilection for the head and neck region. Castleman's disease is a benign lympho-proliferative disorder that most frequently involves the mediastinal lymph nodes. It typically presents in the head and neck as cervical adenopathy of unknown etiology.

Multiple biopsies showing florid lymphoid hyperplasia are frequently required to establish the diagnosis. NEOPLASM Benign Masses Lipomas, hemangiomas, neuromas, and fibromas are benign neoplasms that occur in the neck. They are all characterized by slow growth and lack of invasion. Lipomas are soft masses that are isodense with a fat signal on magnetic resonance imaging. Hemangiomas typically occur with cutaneous manifestations and are relatively easy to recognize. Neuromas may arise from nerves in the neck and rarely present with sensory or motor deficits. Most of these benign masses are diagnosed at the time of surgical excision. 26.

### Unexpected findings in the head and neck: when to raise concern for possible malignancy [^b0e47add]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Imaging of the head and neck is often challenging, given the complex anatomy and breadth of pathology. One particularly challenging scenario is when unexpected head and neck cancers are included on imaging examinations tailored to assess the brain, spine, chest, or vasculature. By detecting unexpected head and neck malignancies, radiologists can facilitate appropriate work-up, specialist referral, and timely treatment with the potential for improved patient outcomes. Through an anatomic site-based approach, this article highlights key imaging findings with which radiologists should be familiar to appropriately raise concern for and direct further work-up of possible head and neck malignancies.

### Isolated cervical dystonia: diagnosis and classification [^b6739451]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Alleviating maneuvers occur in up to 90% of iCDpatients.They usually consist of touching the face with fingertips to temporary ameliorate the dystonic posture or to reduce the abnormal movements and associated discomfort.A slight touch of the chin, cheek, or neck is usually sufficient to relieve symptoms.Sometimes, mere imagination of the gesture without touching the face, head or neck are described as useful to alleviate the symptoms of iCD.The diagnostic relevance of alleviating maneuvers has been recognized, but their specific sensitivity and specificity are not known.Although observed in almost 90% of iCD patients, alleviating maneuvers are effective in ~40%and their effectiveness may diminish with time. The phenomenology of these maneuvers is variable, but consistent in each individual patient. A common phenomenon consists of placement of a finger on the chin or hand in the occipital area of the head; others include touching the lower face or the posterior neck, and, less commonly, the upper face.Another maneuver involves raising the arms without touching the head.Actual pushing of the head into position is typically not needed, but when this is the case, it has been called a “forcible trick”.
Pain is also a frequent and distinctive feature of iCD not usually present in other focal or even generalized dystonia types, affecting 67% to 75% of iCD patients – and significantly influencing their quality of life.Pain does not always correlate with motor symptomatology or changes in posture.It is mostly perceived in the neck and shoulders (68% of patients), but may spread to the upper back region with some radiations directed up to the head on the bent side and down to the ipsilateral upper limb. Cervical pain responds efficiently to botulinum neurotoxin treatments and is often an early symptom to reappear following treatment cycles.The mechanism of pain in iCD is considered to be in part related to muscle overactivity and partly caused by non-muscle related mechanisms, such as abnormal transmission and processing of nociceptive stimuli, dysfunction of descending pain inhibitory pathways as well as structural central network changes.The diagnostic value, sensitivity and specificity of iCD-associated pain have not been assessed. Sensitivity is negatively influenced by the observation that that neck and shoulder pain is reported by some patients with tic disorders with strong cervical tics (eg, dystonic tics).Specificity is negatively influenced by the observation that a proportion of patients are painfree, even with dystonic movements of similar severity and duration to those of patients with pain.Furthermore, patients with a variety of longstanding abnormal movements involving the neck may also experience osteoarticular sources of pain.

### Ten must know pseudolesions of the head and neck [^35ea2dff]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients may present in the emergency setting for a variety of head and neck complaints such as fever, trouble swallowing, or a newly palpable mass. When reviewing radiologic head and neck exams for etiology of complaints, it is important to be familiar with the multiple pseudolesions that may mimic pathology. These may be normal variant anatomy, normal anatomy located in an atypical location, as well as iatrogenic or self-introduced foreign bodies. This review article discusses ten common pseudolesions encountered in the head and neck and their typical imaging appearance so that one does not mistake them for ominous pathology, thus preventing unnecessary follow-up, biopsy, or continued concern for the patient.

### Pseudocyst of the neck after facial augmentation with liquid silicone injection [^bb65b9af]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Injection of liquid silicone was performed illicitly in the 1950s to 1960s and was subsequently prohibited. Many complications arise from silicone injection, and liquid silicone migration is a complication that has not been widely reported. The 55-year-old woman was admitted with a palpable mass on her neck; her symptom started 2 weeks ago. Two years previously, she had received bilateral cosmetic silicone fluid injection in the multiple regions of her face. On physical examination, a 6 × 8-cm palpable mass was seen on anterolateral aspect of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. On enhanced facial computed tomography, multiple abscesses were in the right malar, cheek, and preauricular region with abscess tract sequelae. The author prescribed cephalosporin intravenous antibiotics and performed 2 cm of incision line on the lower one-third neck with local anesthesia, and then drain tube was applied. After 5 days, mass on the neck was not palpated, and right buccal swelling was significantly diminished in size and reflected the resolution of the surrounding inflammatory reaction. Bacterial culture reported growth of some gram-negative rods, Burkholderia gladioli. All injectable dermal fillers can cause complications. Immediate reactions are transient and can include edema, erythema, nodularity, and pain. Late averse events also include immunologic phenomena such as late-onset allergy and nonallergic foreign body granuloma, autoimmune responses, or both. So in this case, the author guessed that silicone fluid causes abscess and then pseudocyst formation on the neck. The key to an accurate diagnosis is asking the patient specifically about his/her history of receiving cosmetic filler injections.

### A telephone survey of cancer awareness among frontline staff: informing training needs [^a7c0cbd3]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 5725 contact details were provided to the market research company of which 1061 were either duplicated, incorrect or for ineligible participants giving a potential study population of 4664 contacts. Of 4664 contacts, 359 people could not be contacted, 1330 could not complete the survey during the study period and 2304 refused, mostly because they were too busy. The overall response rate was 671 out of 4664 (14.4%). Of the 671 participants who completed the interview survey during the study period, 85.5% (n =574) were female and 86.9% (n =583) were aged between 25 and 64 years. Smoking prevalence (13.4%, n =90) was lower than the general population, and educational attainment was higher with 37.9% (n =254) having a degree or higher degree. The majority of staff (89.6%, n =601) were employed by the two PCT. Of the others, 37 (5.5%) were employed by the local authority, 21 (3.1%) by independent health care providers and 12 (1.8%) had other employers (Table 1).

The mean number of warning signs recalled from memory by staff was 3.68 (s.d.=2.05). A swelling or lump was recalled by 482 (71.8%) staff; other signs were recalled by 40% or fewer staff, with cough and hoarseness recalled by only 16.5% (n =111). When directly asked their opinion about whether specific signs or symptoms were warning signs of cancer using closed yes/no questions, there was a high level of recognition of most of the nine warning signs of cancer (Table 2). However, a sore that does not heal, cough or hoarseness and unexplained pain were not recognised as being cancer warning signs by 22.7% (n =152), 13.1% (n =88) and 11.2% (n =75) of participants, respectively (Table 2). Staff recognition of cancer warning signs was higher than that reported for a United Kingdom population sample in the ONS Opinions Survey. The weighted analysis comprised 1858 cases comparable to the 596 cases in our data set with all relevant items of demographic information. Staff awareness levels were only slightly attenuated when characteristics of the survey population were taken into account, supporting higher awareness among staff.

### Description of clinical features and diagnoses of 444 cases with neck-shoulder-upper extremity pain: a single-center retrospective review [^d9f15ef8]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Two independent observers screened patients through a review of the consultation records. Our sample population includes patients with NSUEP who met the eligibility criteria: 1) at least one region of pain in the neck, shoulders, or upper extremities, 2) a clear diagnosis and treatment recommendations were included, and 3) complete clinical data (Figure 1).

Based on available data, the clinical characteristics of NSUEP were subdivided into three main categories: symptoms, signs (including objective signs, provocative test, and ancillary test), and treatments. The diagnoses were categorized as single or compound diagnoses. The compound diagnosis was defined as the “diagnosis of two or more diseases.” Data were entered into a Microsoft Excel (Version 16.0) database. Descriptive statistics are presented for patient clinical features and diagnoses. Frequency and percentages were used for categorical variables, and the mean was estimated for continuous variables.

Back Pain

Lumbosacral pain is characterized by discomfort felt in the region between the lower rib cage and buttock creases, with the potential to radiate into the legs. This type of pain is also referred to as lumbar pain. According to the World Health Organization, low back pain (LBP) is the most common type of musculoskeletal conditions, affecting nearly everyone at some point in their lives.LBP is currently the leading cause of disability. Globally, 619 million people were diagnosed with LBP in 2020; by 2050, this number is projected to rise to 843 million, primarily due to population growth and aging.There is a general upward trend in prevalence from birth to age 80, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 55. LBP is more prevalent in women.LBP can manifest as specific or non-specific. In the former, the pain originates from a disease or structural issue in the spine or radiates from another region of the body. In the latter, the inability to identify a specific disease or structural cause for the pain characterizes the condition. In approximately 90% of cases, there is no clear cause for LBP.

Symptoms

Back pain is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that have been thoroughly researched and documented in an enormous amount of published research. Symptoms can range from intense, deep pain to long-lasting, throbbing discomfort. These symptoms are typically centered in the lower back or middle back. In some cases, patients report discomfort that spreads to the limbs, in addition to sensations of tingling, numbness, or paralysis, all of which are indicative of the possibility of nerve involvement. Musculoskeletal symptoms, which include rigidity, muscle spasms, and restricted movement, are regularly experienced by individuals. These symptoms frequently exacerbate functional restrictions and reduce overall well-being. Additionaly, discomfort typically becomes more severe with intense physical activity, extended periods of standing or sitting, and during the night, leading to disruptions in normal sleep rhythms. Anxiety and depression often occur concurrently, adding another layer of complication to the clinical presentation. Due to the complex interaction of various symptoms, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment is necessary. This highlights the relevance of individualized treatment strategies for managing the numerous forms of back pain. It is imperative that the treatment be multimodal and in accordance with the most recent standards established by both national and international organizations.
