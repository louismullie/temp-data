## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy who continues to wet the bed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy who continues to wet the bed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and correctly classifying the enuresis phenotype. Then, I should evaluate the three core pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive nocturnal enuresis. Next, I will screen for high-yield comorbidities and rule out secondary organic causes. After that, I will consider lifestyle and genetic contributors and outline an investigation plan. Finally, I will synthesize the differential and note treatment-resistant considerations alongside first-line options, making sure each step aligns with ICCS, EAU/ESPU, and AAFP guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and classification so I do not miss a secondary process. By standard definitions, nocturnal enuresis is intermittent nighttime urinary incontinence occurring in children aged 5 years and older, typically assessed at a minimum frequency threshold and duration, after excluding organic causes; many clinicians use at least twice weekly for three months, though the ICCS recognizes at least once per month for three months in epidemiologic contexts, and in practice the focus is on clinically meaningful frequency and impact [^111enxt1] [^113Ei5Cm]. I should confirm whether this is primary versus secondary enuresis by asking if the child ever achieved at least six consecutive dry months, and distinguish monosymptomatic from non-monosymptomatic forms by probing daytime lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, incontinence, weak stream, or straining, because this classification drives evaluation and treatment per ICCS and EAU/ESPU standards [^111enxt1] [^116RNzs1]. Hold on, I should verify the age-related context too; prevalence declines with age and is around low single digits by mid-adolescence, so persistence at 12 years warrants a thorough, structured approach rather than reassurance alone [^113Ei5Cm].

> Next, I should review the three interrelated pathophysiologic drivers and begin mapping the case to these mechanisms. The canonical triad includes nocturnal polyuria due to circadian AVP dysregulation or intake patterns, reduced nocturnal bladder capacity or detrusor overactivity, and impaired arousal to bladder signaling during sleep; most children exhibit a combination, and identifying the dominant mechanism improves treatment matching, for example desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria or alarm for arousal deficits and capacity issues [^111enxt1] [^112jwELM]. Wait, let me verify how to assess these at the bedside; a 48–72 hour bladder diary capturing fluids, voiding times, volumes, and wet nights helps quantify nighttime urine production relative to expected capacity, while careful history of holding maneuvers, daytime urgency, or weak stream suggests underlying bladder dysfunction, and parental reports of very deep sleep or difficulty arousing may indicate an arousal component; EAU/ESPU specifically support desmopressin in proven nighttime polyuria, which I should document objectively whenever possible before committing to long-term use [^1164wwoh] [^114jjh3b].

> I will now examine high-yield comorbidities that either perpetuate symptoms or alter management priority. Constipation and bladder–bowel dysfunction are common in enuretic children and should be addressed before initiating enuresis-specific therapy because stool burden impairs bladder emptying and stability; AAFP and ICCS both emphasize prioritizing constipation and daytime LUTS management when present, which can itself reduce wet nights substantially [^112sQ3YZ] [^111enxt1]. I need to check for psychiatric and behavioral comorbidity, particularly ADHD and anxiety/depression, which are overrepresented and can worsen adherence and outcomes; standardized screening tools can be helpful to structure this assessment and guide support [^1138R7Bs]. But wait, what if sleep-disordered breathing is contributing to nocturnal polyuria or arousal failure; snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, and enlarged tonsils should prompt ENT evaluation because adenotonsillectomy can improve enuresis in selected children with OSA [^116L3V7e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding important secondary organic causes. I should obtain a urinalysis in all patients to screen for infection, glucosuria suggestive of diabetes mellitus, and low specific gravity that could indicate diabetes insipidus, adding targeted labs such as serum glucose and electrolytes if polyuria or polydipsia are present, as recommended by AAFP and EAU/ESPU [^117SymH5] [^1167wrfZ]. Imaging such as renal and bladder ultrasound is not routinely indicated in straightforward monosymptomatic cases but becomes appropriate when red flags exist, such as recurrent UTIs, daytime urinary dysfunction, abnormal stream, or suspected structural or neurologic abnormalities, with EAU/ESPU endorsing stepwise escalation in complex or refractory presentations [^116RNzs1]. I should also remain alert for rare contributors like neurogenic bladder, sickle cell disease in high-risk groups, and endocrine disorders when the history or exam suggests them, rather than ordering broad screening indiscriminately [^117SymH5].

> Let me think about modifiable lifestyle and inherited susceptibilities because they often shape both counseling and response. Family history is common with an autosomal dominant pattern and high penetrance, and boys are affected more often than girls; discussing the heritable nature can reduce stigma and improve engagement with treatment [^117L6JSz] [^113Ei5Cm]. I should confirm evening habits, including total fluid intake, timing, and caffeine exposure, since late, high-volume intake can amplify nocturnal polyuria; in parallel, I will counsel on regular daytime voiding to avoid underfilled bladder patterns that paradoxically impair capacity signaling at night, consistent with urotherapy principles [^111enxt1]. Hmm, wait a minute, screen time is easy to overlook; recent pediatric data suggest that limiting daily screen time, particularly in the evening, may improve sleep architecture and treatment response, with lower failure and relapse rates when screen exposure is restricted, so I should incorporate this into sleep hygiene counseling while acknowledging the need for more trials [^115z5veQ] [^117TiCnT].

> Next, I should review the investigation plan and ensure it is proportionate to the phenotype and severity. For all patients, I will obtain a detailed history covering daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, sleep and snoring, fluid timing, and family history; perform an exam including abdominal, genital, and focused neurologic assessments; and order urinalysis; I will also request a bladder diary and, when feasible, a bowel diary, to quantify patterns and guide mechanism-targeted therapy, in line with AAFP and ICCS guidance [^117SymH5] [^111enxt1]. If daytime LUTS are reported or refractory symptoms emerge, I should add post-void residual ultrasound and consider renal/bladder ultrasound, and if OSA features are present, proceed with polysomnography and ENT referral; the EAU/ESPU supports structured symptom tools and voiding diaries to standardize assessment and follow-up [^1164wwoh] [^116L3V7e]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering advanced testing; per ICCS, in the absence of warning signs like voiding difficulty or excessive thirst, routine blood tests, radiology, or urodynamics are not required initially [^111enxt1].

> Now, let me consider first-line management options briefly to ensure the differential links to actionable steps, even though the focus here is diagnostic reasoning. For monosymptomatic cases, enuresis alarms and desmopressin are co–first-line; alarms have the best chance of long-term dryness by modifying arousal and bladder capacity mechanisms, while desmopressin offers faster symptom reduction, especially in nocturnal polyuria phenotypes, with AAFP and ICCS supporting this approach; dosing for oral desmopressin typically starts at 0.2 mg qHS and may be titrated to 0.6 mg if needed per FDA labeling, with careful attention to fluid restriction to minimize hyponatremia risk [^113wAi45] [^111enxt1] [^116d9gDK] [^115VLwzS]. I should double-check that families are motivated and able to implement alarms because adherence is crucial; for desmopressin, I need to document nighttime polyuria when possible and counsel about relapse risk after discontinuation, which is higher than with alarms, but can be mitigated by structured withdrawal strategies [^114jjh3b] [^111enxt1].

> For treatment-resistant or complex presentations, I need to ensure I have not missed comorbid constipation, daytime dysfunction, or OSA, and I should re-evaluate adherence before escalating pharmacotherapy. Low adherence is a common cause of apparent desmopressin failure and can be improved with education and structured urotherapy or "voiding school" approaches; if the phenotype suggests reduced capacity or detrusor overactivity, adding an anticholinergic to desmopressin is reasonable per ICCS and supportive cohort data, while truly refractory or atypical cases may warrant urodynamics and, if indicated, further imaging in line with EAU/ESPU re-evaluation recommendations [^115eVVE7] [^111enxt1] [^1143H3Fi] [^116RNzs1]. Hold on, I should verify that adult urodynamic patterns do not directly translate to children, but the high rate of detrusor overactivity in refractory older adolescents and adults with persistent enuresis underscores why capacity-targeted strategies and, in select cases, invasive studies can be informative when standard therapy fails despite good adherence [^115wSTmV].

> With these elements in mind, I will now synthesize the differential diagnosis for this 12-year-old boy. The most likely diagnosis, provided there are no daytime urinary symptoms and no prior six-month dry period, is primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis driven by one or more of the following: nocturnal polyuria, reduced functional nocturnal bladder capacity or detrusor overactivity, and an arousal deficit, which should be profiled using history and diaries to guide therapy selection, consistent with ICCS and AAFP frameworks [^111enxt1] [^117SymH5]. If daytime urgency, frequency, or incontinence are present, non-monosymptomatic enuresis with bladder–bowel dysfunction becomes more likely and mandates prioritizing constipation management and daytime LUTS interventions before enuresis-specific treatment; concurrent ADHD or anxiety, and signs of OSA should be actively screened and addressed because they modify both prognosis and adherence [^112sQ3YZ] [^116L3V7e] [^1138R7Bs]. Secondary or organic causes are less common but must be excluded systematically with urinalysis and targeted testing for diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary tract infection, neurogenic bladder, and structural anomalies when red flags or atypical features are present, per EAU/ESPU and AAFP guidance [^1167wrfZ] [^116RNzs1] [^117SymH5].

---

A 12-year-old male with persistent bedwetting most likely has **primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis** due to delayed arousal [^112jwELM], nocturnal polyuria [^113Ei5Cm], or reduced bladder capacity [^114Fqyvs]. Secondary causes include **urinary tract infection**, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus [^112dQyFS], constipation, **obstructive sleep apnea** [^113ZvWrH], neurogenic bladder, and psychological stress [^111enxt1]. Initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical exam [^111enxt1], and **urinalysis** [^117SymH5] [^1167wrfZ]; further testing (renal/bladder ultrasound, urodynamics, MRI) is reserved for refractory or complex cases [^116RNzs1]. Management starts with behavioral measures [^112sQ3YZ], enuresis alarms [^113wAi45], and desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria [^114jjh3b]; treat constipation [^116TkCxr] and refer to pediatric urology if refractory [^114iSrqW].

## Differential diagnosis

### Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE)

Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis is persistent bedwetting without daytime symptoms [^114iSrqW], typically related to delayed arousal [^112jwELM], **nocturnal polyuria** [^113Ei5Cm], or **reduced bladder capacity** [^114Fqyvs]. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving delayed maturation of bladder control, circadian disturbances in vasopressin secretion, and brainstem immaturity [^113Ei5Cm] [^112jwELM]. Risk factors include family history, constipation, psychological stress, ADHD, and sleep disorders [^111enxt1] [^112NUuSk].

---

### Secondary enuresis

Secondary enuresis is the recurrence of bedwetting after **six or more months of dryness**, often reflecting an underlying medical or psychological condition [^111enxt1]. Common causes include urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus, constipation or fecal retention, obstructive sleep apnea [^113ZvWrH], neurogenic bladder or spinal cord abnormalities, and psychological stress or psychiatric disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression, ADHD) [^112dQyFS].

---

### Structural or anatomical abnormalities

Structural or anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to enuresis include **posterior urethral valves** causing congenital obstruction, urethral strictures or meatal stenosis leading to incomplete bladder emptying, and **ectopic ureter** resulting in continuous leakage. These abnormalities impair normal urine storage or emptying [^116RNzs1].

---

### Neurological disorders

Neurological disorders include **neurogenic bladder** — associated with spinal dysraphism, tethered cord, or spinal cord injury — and **seizure disorders**, in which nocturnal seizures may present as enuresis [^116RNzs1].

---

### Endocrine disorders

Endocrine disorders encompass **diabetes mellitus**, with polyuria due to hyperglycemia, and **diabetes insipidus**, with polyuria from impaired antidiuretic hormone function [^117SymH5] [^112dQyFS].

---

### Psychological and behavioral factors

Psychological and behavioral factors include **stressful life events** — such as family conflict, school stress, or trauma — and **psychiatric disorders**, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD [^1138R7Bs] [^112NUuSk].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

The initial evaluation includes a **detailed history** covering frequency and pattern, family history, daytime symptoms, fluid intake, bowel habits, and psychological stressors [^111enxt1] [^114iSrqW]. The **physical examination** should assess growth and blood pressure and include an abdominal, neurologic, and genital examination [^117SymH5]. **Urinalysis** is used to screen for infection, glycosuria, and proteinuria [^117SymH5] [^1167wrfZ].

---

### Further evaluation (if indicated)

- **Renal and bladder ultrasound**: Structural abnormalities, bladder wall thickness, post-void residual [^116RNzs1].

- **Urodynamic studies**: Suspected bladder dysfunction or refractory cases [^116RNzs1].

- **MRI of lumbosacral spine**: Suspected neurogenic bladder or spinal abnormalities [^116RNzs1].

- **Polysomnography**: Suspected obstructive sleep apnea [^113ZvWrH].

---

## Management strategies

### Behavioral interventions

Behavioral interventions include bladder training with a regular voiding schedule, fluid management, and constipation management [^112sQ3YZ]. **Enuresis alarms** are a first-line option for motivated families [^1153k66F] [^113wAi45]. Psychological support addresses stressors and may involve counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Desmopressin**: Effective for nocturnal polyuria [^114jjh3b]; monitor for hyponatremia [^115VLwzS].

- **Anticholinergics**: Oxybutynin or tolterodine for bladder overactivity [^111enxt1].

- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: Imipramine for refractory cases [^111dG2tg].

---

### Addressing underlying conditions

Addressing underlying conditions includes managing **constipation** through dietary changes, laxatives, and bowel regimens [^112sQ3YZ] [^116TkCxr]. For obstructive sleep apnea, arrange ENT evaluation and consider **adenotonsillectomy** when indicated [^116L3V7e]. Psychiatric comorbidities warrant appropriate evaluation and treatment [^1138R7Bs].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent enuresis despite initial management** [^114iSrqW].

- **Daytime urinary symptoms or recurrent UTIs** [^116RNzs1].

- **Suspected structural or neurological abnormalities** [^116RNzs1].

- **Significant psychological or behavioral comorbidities** [^1138R7Bs].

- **Family preference or significant psychosocial impact**.

---

Persistent bedwetting in a 12-year-old male requires a **structured evaluation** [^111enxt1] to distinguish PMNE from secondary causes, with **management tailored** to the underlying etiology and patient needs.

### Management and treatment of nocturnal enuresis-an updated standardization document from the International Children's Continence Society [^111enxt1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). High credibility.

Enuresis is an extremely common condition, which, although somatically benign, poses long-term psychosocial risks if untreated. There are still many misconceptions regarding the proper management of these children.

- **Aim**: A cross-professional team of experts affiliated with the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) undertook to update the previous guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children with enuresis.

- **Methods**: The document used the globally accepted ICCS terminology. Evidence-based literature served as the basis; however, in areas lacking primary evidence, expert consensus was used. Before submission, a full draft was made available to all ICCS members for additional comments.

- **Results**: In the absence of certain warning signs (i.e. voiding difficulties, excessive thirst), the enuretic child does not need blood tests, radiology, or urodynamic assessment. Active therapy is recommended from the age of 6 years. The most important comorbid conditions to consider are psychiatric disorders, constipation, urinary tract infections, and snoring or sleep apneas. Constipation and daytime incontinence, if present, should be treated. In nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, it is recommended that basic advice regarding voiding and drinking habits be provided. In monosymptomatic enuresis, or if the above strategy did not make the child dry, the first-line treatment modalities are desmopressin or the enuresis alarm. If both these therapies fail alone or in combination, anticholinergic treatment is a possible next step.

### Assessment of nocturnal enuresis diagnostic criteria [^113Ei5Cm]. Anales de Pediatria (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on enuresis:

- **Definition**: Enuresis is the involuntary or intentional discharge of urine after the age at which bladder control is expected, typically beyond 5 years of age.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of enuresis is multifactorial and not fully understood. It is believed to involve a delay in the maturation of the mechanisms controlling urination during sleep. This includes a maturational deficit in motor performance, particularly for repetitive hand and finger movements, and a possible maturational deficit of the motor cortex circuitry and related cortical areas. Disturbances in the circadian rhythm of arginine-vasopressin, leading to excess urine production during sleep, are also common in children with enuresis. Additionally, immaturity of the brainstem may be involved in the pathogenesis of enuresis.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is estimated at 6–10% at age 7, decreasing to 2% by age 15, and further to 0.5–2% in adulthood. Boys are twice as affected as girls.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for enuresis include a family history of the condition, constipation, UTIs, and psychological stress. Secondary nocturnal enuresis can develop after traumatic events such as traffic accidents. Additionally, conditions like attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder can be associated with enuresis.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, enuresis presents with bedwetting that is inappropriate for the child's developmental age, typically occurring at least twice a week for three consecutive months.

### The role of sleep in the pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis [^112jwELM]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a common condition affecting 5–10% of all 7-year-old children. NE pathophysiology relies on three main factors: abnormal bladder function, excess urine production during sleep, and the inability to awaken to the signals of a full bladder. The aim of this review is to evaluate the connection between sleep and its structure and the pathophysiology of NE. NE often occurs early at night and primarily in sleep stage 2 and "deep sleep". Although sleep stage distribution seems similar between NE and healthy children, recent studies indicate differences in sleep microstructure.

Several lines of research support the common notion among parents that children with NE are difficult to awaken. Moreover, children with NE and nocturnal polyuria differ in terms of hemodynamics and possibly autonomic activation at night compared to healthy controls, leading to the hypothesis that these changes are attributable to different sleep characteristics. In support of this hypothesis, children with NE often suffer from sleep-disordered breathing, as well as disturbed sleep due to awakenings and arousals. Periodic limb movements (PLM) have been observed in children with refractory enuresis, but the clinical significance remains unclear.

### Nocturia: "do the math" [^1159Kiet]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed the definition and etiologies of nocturia, offering diagnostic procedures and standards of care. Recent literature regarding nocturia, along with paradigms for diagnosis and management, was also reviewed.

Nocturia is common as a limited occurrence but becomes troublesome if the patient experiences more than two episodes during sleep hours. The four principal etiologies associated with nocturia (nocturnal polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity, mixed polyuria, and global polyuria) can be differentiated easily through mathematical analysis of a 24-hour bladder diary.

Nocturia is highly treatable in many patients. Identification of the precise type and its cause enables clinicians to minimize the inconvenience and sleep deprivation associated with nocturia.

### Parental perception and factors associated with treatment strategies for primary nocturnal enuresis [^117SycHZ]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim was to investigate the factors influencing parents seeking reasonable management for their child and their overall outlook toward primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE).

We recruited 93 children with PNE from enuresis clinics and requested their parents to complete questionnaires regarding their child's medical history and behavior, their methods for coping with PNE, and their perception of enuresis. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate factors influencing the parents to adopt a positive approach toward enuresis and to subsequently seek a medical consultation.

- **Results**: One-third of the parents had an encouraging attitude toward children with PNE, whereas slightly less than half reacted with anger. The more educated the father or the younger the child with NE, the larger the possibility of the parents utilizing a positive approach, such as encouragement, for coping with NE. Factors that influenced parents to seek medical consultation for NE were socioeconomic status, maternal educational level, and the age and birth order of their child.

- **Discussion**: From our results, angry and frustrated parents (43.0%) were significantly more likely to punish their child for bedwetting than were parents who approached NE positively (comfort and encouragement; 33.3%). A lack of encouragement may negatively affect the self-esteem of children with NE. Moreover, an individual's self-esteem or confidence, both of which can help them eliminate NE, determines the person's behavioral response to bedwetting. In our study, approximately 50% of the parents had variations in their approach based on the factors studied.

### Primary nocturnal enuresis: A novel therapeutic strategy with higher efficacy [^1143H3Fi]. Urology (2019). Low credibility.

To introduce a new protocol for patients with primary nocturnal enuresis, the aim is to increase the efficacy of treatment and decrease the relapse rate. A prospective study was conducted on 185 children diagnosed with nocturnal enuresis between 2007 and 2014.

Inclusion criteria consisted of age greater than 5 years, monosymptomatic enuresis or non-monosymptomatic enuresis, strict adherence to the protocol, and a follow-up period greater than 24 months. Exclusion criteria included secondary enuresis, poor compliance with the protocol, and neurogenic bladder. Participants were started on combination therapy of desmopressin 120 µg (MELT formula) once per day and propiverine 7.5 mg twice per day, which were then adjusted as per their response to therapy and our designed protocol. The outcome was defined according to the latest definitions provided by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS).

One hundred twenty-two patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the study, with a median age of 9 years (range 5–19 years). The mean follow-up time was 62 months (range 25–114 months). Our protocol showed an overall complete success rate of 87%, with failure and relapse at 13%. The success rate of patients needing 120 µg desmopressin as maintenance therapy to achieve dryness was 92.7%, compared to 65% success in patients needing a higher dose of desmopressin to achieve dryness (P .05).

Adopting combination therapy along with structured withdrawal as per our protocol showed higher success rates.

### Psychological and psychiatric issues in urinary and fecal incontinence [^1138R7Bs]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

We provide an overview of the psychological and psychiatric aspects of nocturnal enuresis, urinary, and fecal incontinence. Clinical behavioral disorders and subclinical psychological symptoms are reviewed. Aspects of screening, assessment, counseling, and in severe cases, treatment are outlined, and recommendations are formulated.

- **Materials and methods**: Relevant publications on psychological and psychiatric aspects are reviewed. The recommendations passed several rounds of consensus finding and were circulated among International Children's Continence Society members and external experts.

- **Results**: In addition to subclinical effects on self-esteem, quality of life, and distress, the rate of comorbid clinical behavioral disorders is increased. In fact, 20% to 30% of children with nocturnal enuresis, 20% to 40% with daytime urinary incontinence, and 30% to 50% with fecal incontinence fulfill the criteria for ICD-10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV psychiatric disorders. These concomitant disturbances require assessment and counseling, and in severe cases, treatment. They have a negative effect on compliance and outcomes if not addressed and left untreated.

- **Conclusions**: Because the comorbidity rate is high, screening for psychological symptoms is recommended for all children in all settings with enuresis and/or daytime urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Standardized, validated questionnaires are recommended. In addition to clinical observation and history, a short screening questionnaire can be used as a first step.

### Prevalence and factors associated with nocturnal enuresis and social anxiety among Palestinian primary school children: a cross-sectional study [^116Wnux5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is involuntary urination during sleep that occurs beyond the age when bladder control is usually developed, typically after the age of five. This prevalent pediatric condition affects millions of children worldwide and can sometimes persist into adolescence and adulthood. NE impacts not only the physical health of those affected but also presents significant psychological and social challenges. It often leads to embarrassment, low self-esteem, and disrupted sleep patterns for children and their families.

According to the diagnostic standards of the International Children's Continence Society, NE can be identified when no other symptoms are affecting the lower urinary tract or a history of bladder dysfunction. A disturbing and prevalent developmental disorder, NE affects between 15% and 20% of children aged five and around 2% of young adults. Among school-aged children (6 to 13 years old), the prevalence of NE is 6.5% for girls and 12.4% for boys. However, its prevalence varies across different regions due to genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.

Studies conducted in regional countries highlight these differences, with reported prevalence rates of 10.2% in Iran, 18% in Egypt, 23.8% in Jordan, and 30.5% in Abu Dhabi. Research on NE remains scarce in Palestine, where cultural stigmas and healthcare access may contribute to underreporting, explaining the lack of data on NE prevalence and its psychosocial impact. In addition, NE remains a complex condition influenced by various risk factors, including sex, age, and family background.

### Low compliance contributes to insufficient desmopressin response of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and the role of voiding school [^115eVVE7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

A prospective cohort study, observing primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) patients, was carried out from 2017 to 2020 at the Urology Department of the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. A total of 124 patients were diagnosed with primary MNE, 96 met the inclusion criteria, and 89 patients agreed to participate in the study.

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as patient assessment criteria, were previously published. Briefly, patients with an active urinary tract infection, non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE), bowel dysfunction (constipation/encopresis), endocrine, neurological, and psychiatric disorders, hypertension, presence or history of renal disease, genitourinary or congenital abnormality, secondary enuresis and previous medical/alarm therapy for nocturnal enuresis were excluded from the study. NMNE was defined as increased/decreased voiding frequency, daytime incontinence, urgency, hesitancy, straining, a weak stream, intermittency, holding maneuvers, a feeling of incomplete emptying, post-voiding dribble, and genital or lower urinary tract pain.

Urine analysis, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and complete blood count, as well as ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract, were performed if necessary. Finally, the study included only the primary MNE patients in whom solely nocturnal polyuria was diagnosed; the existence of a lower-capacity bladder was ruled out. All patients were newly diagnosed with primary MNE, were medical treatment-naive, and did not respond to conservative modalities for at least three months.

### Childhood nocturnal enuresis-a marker for pelvic floor disorders and urinary tract symptoms in women [^116iHu4x]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

This prospective cohort study used data from a national population register linked to information from a questionnaire survey about symptoms of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The postal and internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted in 2014. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (reference no. 776–13; November 18, 2013), and all women received written information and gave their consent to participate by answering the questionnaire.

The potential study population was identified by Statistics Sweden from the Total Population Register and comprised women registered in Sweden (> 99%) who had not given birth and were 25–64 years of age. The lower limit of the age span was set to 25 years because studies of adolescent girls and young women indicate that the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) seems to stabilize at a minimum during the 3rd decade. The upper limit was set to 65 years because confounding, age-dependent comorbidities potentially influence the prevalence of PFDs, which is known to increase rapidly from the 7th decade.

### Sleep/arousal and enuresis subtypes [^114Fqyvs]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The mechanisms responsible for enuresis are maturational delays, and the extent of the maturational lag equates with the severity of the clinical picture.

- **Materials and methods**: A literature review was conducted comparing the mechanisms of bladder physiology in normal children and those with enuresis.

- **Results**: Several mechanisms are associated with enuresis, including nocturnal urine volume, nocturnal functional bladder capacity, spontaneous bladder contractions, and the inability to arouse to the stimulus of a large and/or contracting bladder. There is adequate evidence for children with enuresis who demonstrate nocturnal spontaneous bladder contractions (detrusor-dependent enuresis) and nocturnal polyuria (volume-dependent enuresis). A recent study has shown that children with enuresis are difficult to arouse in the first two-thirds of the night, which is also associated with the period of greatest wetting frequency. Night dry children may demonstrate daytime frequency and urgency; others may have nocturia, and some are difficult to arouse. Subtyping into volume-dependent and detrusor-dependent types may only describe specific entities of a larger array of clinical presentations.

- **Conclusions**: It is proposed that the mechanisms responsible for enuresis are maturational delays, and the extent of the maturational lag equates with the severity of the clinical picture. Included in this clinical spectrum are children who demonstrate diurnal incontinence and those with secondary enuresis. The former is a condition of maturational severity, and the latter is a maturation issue.

### Childhood nocturnal enuresis-a marker for pelvic floor disorders and urinary tract symptoms in women [^1129Kr3J]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: The main finding of this study was that the prevalence of a wide spectrum of pelvic floor disorders and lower urinary tract symptoms was approximately doubled in nulliparous women with a history of childhood nocturnal enuresis (NE). The prevalence of micturition frequency ≥ 8/day, nocturia ≥ 2/night, overactive bladder (OAB), symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (sPOP), fecal incontinence (FI), and ≥ 1 pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) was higher in nulliparous women with a history of childhood NE compared to women without a history of childhood NE, suggesting that there may be at least one common causal factor linking childhood NE to these adult pelvic floor disorders.

The earliest studies about a possible association between childhood nocturnal enuresis (CNE) and PFDs in adulthood demonstrated an association with adult urge urinary incontinence (UUI) but not stress urinary incontinence (SUI). These observations were later confirmed for UUI (OR 2.7, p < 0.005) and severe urinary incontinence (UI) (OR 2.9, p = 0.002) in the study by Kuh et al, involving 1333 predominantly multiparous women aged 48 years. In a clinical evaluation of 1021 women during annual gynecological examinations, Gurbuz et al. found an association between CNE and SUI and FI but no association with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) and UUI. Fitzgerald et al. showed an association with adult UUI occurring weekly or more often (OR 2.7), but no association was found with urinary frequency ≥ 8/day, nocturia ≥ 2/night, urgency, or SUI occurring weekly or more often. D'Ancona et al. interviewed patients presenting with UI at an outpatient clinic (585 women, 76 men, mean age 54 years) and found that those with MUI and UUI in adult life were more likely to have a history of CNE than those with adult SUI. Thus, overall, these studies, although they preferentially focused on UI, were conflicting and were based on…

### Ddavp [^115VLwzS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were between 5–17 years old, and 72% were male. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. During a two-week baseline period, the average number of wet nights was 10 (ranging from 4–14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of DDAVP or placebo.

- **Pooled results**: Patients treated with DDAVP tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg.

In a six-month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day of DDAVP. The dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved, with a maximum dose of 0.6 mg/day. A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy. The average number of wet nights over two weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4–14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Of these, 25 patients (11%) achieved a complete or near-complete response (≤ 2 wet nights/2 weeks) without requiring titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 patients (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights over two weeks, while 87 patients (38%) achieved a complete response.

### The effect of screen time on the presentation and treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^115z5veQ]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, bringing screen time to a normal range, which should be controlled in childhood, can be considered to contribute to the treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, just as it will contribute to a sufficient level of physical activity in children. This method, which can be easily applied and is beneficial, shows a positive effect on response to treatment and recurrence. Nevertheless, there is a need for further randomized, controlled studies and meta-analyses, as required by evidence-based medical regulations, to support these results.

### Childhood nocturnal enuresis - a marker for pelvic floor disorders and urinary tract symptoms in women [^117DqXbh]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

In future epidemiological research, it would be interesting to define high- and low-risk subgroups of childhood nocturnal enuresis (CNE) for adult pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), such as those with early versus late spontaneous recovery of CNE, monosymptomatic versus non-monosymptomatic children with any concomitant lower urinary tract symptoms, more frequent bedwetters (once a week or more) compared to low-frequency bedwetters by age, and the interaction between CNE and childbirth.

### Long-term follow-up of children with nocturnal enuresis: Increased frequency of nocturia in adulthood [^113tfMM7]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

We investigated the long-term prognosis of a cohort of children with nocturnal enuresis and identified the prevalence of nocturia and persistent comorbid symptoms. A questionnaire was sent to 1,265 patients treated for nocturnal enuresis during childhood at our university hospital. We used a validated tool, the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire on overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, to evaluate the presence of urological symptoms. Participants were also asked about the treatment received for nocturnal enuresis, and their medical files were analyzed.

A total of 516 patients (41%) returned the questionnaire. The mean age was 17 years, and 64% of patients were male. Urgency, daytime frequency, and urinary incontinence were reported by 17%, 8%, and 25% of patients, respectively. During the period of nocturnal enuresis, up to 60% of patients had concomitant daytime symptoms. Nocturia was reported by 182 participants (35%). Males comprised 56% of patients (101) with nocturia and 69% of patients (230) without nocturia. The prevalence of daytime symptoms and incontinence was higher in patients with nocturia (p < 0.001). Those with nocturia were older at the resolution of nocturnal enuresis (p < 0.001) and experienced more nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (p < 0.014).

About a third of patients experience nocturia, a fourth still report some kind of urinary incontinence, a fifth have regular urgency, and a tenth have daytime frequency. Thus, the resolution of nocturnal enuresis does not necessarily lead to complete remission of symptoms.

### The effect of screen time on the presentation and treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^116YwV6X]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, commonly known as bedwetting, is defined as intermittent nighttime bedwetting only, without any daytime lower urinary tract symptoms. When this continues without a six-month dry period, it is known as primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE). This condition is considered physiological up to the age of five years, and treatment is recommended for children older than six years.

Three important pathophysiological factors are responsible for PMNE. Two of these factors are an increase in the nighttime-to-daytime urine output ratio and reduced nocturnal functional bladder capacity. However, the primary pathophysiology is believed to be an increased threshold for waking from sleep despite the fullness of the bladder. Research has shown differences in REM sleep patterns between bedwetting children and their peers, as proven in sleep disorder laboratory tests. Consequently, many causes of sleep disorders, primarily adenotonsillar hypertrophy, have been researched in relation to the etiology of PMNE.

In recent studies, screen time (ST) exposure has been reported as a factor that could lead to sleep disorders. It has been determined that excessive screen time (EST), which can lead to emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems, also impairs sleep quality. Considering screen time as a potential pathophysiological factor for sleep disorders in children diagnosed with PMNE, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there is any relationship between screen time and the degree and severity.

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: a comparative study [^116eFTkf]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The study examined various factors potentially associated with nocturnal enuresis, including sleep patterns, daytime urination control, fluid intake habits, frequency and volume of bedwetting episodes, family history, urinary urgency and frequency, bladder capacity, bowel habits, and emotional factors.

- **Abnormal urine volume**: Abnormal urine volume was defined as urine output per bedwetting episode exceeding the expected bladder capacity for the child's age. For children aged 5–8 years, this was calculated using the formula: Bladder capacity (mL) = 30 × (age in years) + 30.

- **Abnormal ultrasound findings**: Abnormal ultrasound findings included any deviation from normal kidney and bladder anatomy or function. This encompassed findings such as increased bladder wall thickness, residual urine volume exceeding 20 mL after voiding, and structural anomalies such as vesicoureteral reflux or hydronephrosis. These definitions were standardized to ensure consistent assessment and reporting across all study participants.

- **Statistical analysis**: Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 and R (version 4.4.2). Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables, including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. The Fisher's exact test was employed to assess the relationship between various factors and the two study groups. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### The safety and efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of refractory primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis in children: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^113ar6bP]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for treating refractory primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis in children.

- **Materials and methods**: Children aged 8–18 years with severe primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis unresponsive to alarm therapy, desmopressin, and anticholinergics were screened for eligibility. After excluding children with daytime urinary symptoms, constipation, and underlying urological, neuropsychiatric, endocrinological, or cardiac conditions, patients were randomly and equally assigned to receive 10 mg fluoxetine once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was treatment response according to the International Children's Continence Society terminology, while treatment-related adverse effects and nighttime arousal were secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 150 children were enrolled; 110 (56 in the fluoxetine group and 54 in the placebo group) with a mean age of 11.8 (SD 2.46) years were finally analyzed. After 4 weeks, 7.1% of the fluoxetine group achieved complete response and 66.1% achieved partial response (defined as 50%-99% reduction in the number of wet nights), compared to 0% and 16.7% of the placebo group, respectively (P < .001). At 12 weeks, complete and partial responses were achieved in 10.7% and 21.4% of the fluoxetine group, respectively, versus 0% and 14.8% of the placebo group (P = 0.023). Fluoxetine-treated patients experienced fewer wet nights: 4.7 (SD 4.2) fortnightly vs. 9.7 (SD 3.5) at 4 weeks (P < .001) and 5.7 (SD 4.4) vs. 9.9 (SD 3.4) at 8 weeks (P < .001). The data truncated after 8 weeks suggests a continuation of improved outcomes with fluoxetine.

### The genetics of enuresis: a review [^117L6JSz]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Formal studies of the genetics of enuresis have been conducted since the 1930s, with molecular genetics research beginning in 1995, both emphasizing the significance of hereditary factors in the etiology of nocturnal enuresis. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the genetics of nocturnal enuresis and its genotype-phenotype interactions.

A comprehensive review of the published data on the genetic basis of enuresis was performed. Genetic factors are primarily significant in the etiology of nocturnal enuresis, though somatic and psychosocial environmental factors exert a major modulatory effect. Typically, nocturnal enuresis is inherited through an autosomal dominant mode of transmission with high penetrance (90%). However, about one-third of cases are sporadic, and the distinction between sporadic and familial forms remains unclear.

Four gene loci associated with nocturnal enuresis have been identified, and it is presumed that others exist (locus heterogeneity). Thus far, all likely candidate genes have been excluded. No specific association is found among the different loci, types of wetting, and other phenotype aspects. All subtypes of nocturnal enuresis (primary, secondary, combined day/night wetting) are subject to comparable genetic influences. While certain syndromes of day wetting follow distinct genetic mechanisms, their association with the genetics of nocturnal enuresis is not established.

Nocturnal enuresis is a common, genetic, and heterogeneous disorder. The associations between genotype and phenotype are complex.

### Adolescents with nocturnal enuresis and daytime urinary incontinence-how can pediatric and adult care be improved-ICI-RS 2015 [^114LKyzG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis (NE) and daytime urinary incontinence (DUI) are common in adolescents. The aim of this paper was to review studies on prevalence, clinical symptoms, and associated risk factors and to formulate recommendations for assessment and treatment.

A systematic Scopus search was performed, and relevant publications were selected. The topic was discussed during the ICI-RS meeting in 2015.

One to two percent of older adolescents are affected by NE, and 1% by DUI. NE and DUI are associated with multiple risk factors such as fecal incontinence and constipation, obesity, chronic illness, and psychological impairment. Chronic treatment-resistant, relapsing, and new-onset cases can occur. Adolescent NE and DUI can be treated by a multidisciplinary team according to pediatric principles. Additional treatment components have been developed for adolescents. Transition from pediatric to adult services is frequently disorganized.

Incontinence in adolescents is a neglected research topic, and clinical care is often suboptimal. As adolescents are seen by both pediatric and adult services, alignment and harmonization of diagnostic and therapeutic principles are needed. Also, an organized transition process is recommended to improve care for adolescent patients.

### Is routine urinary tract investigation necessary for children with monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis [^111ZFghr]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate in a prospective study the role of bladder function, the research compared the results of urinary tract ultrasonography and urinalysis in children with and without primary nocturnal enuresis. Despite being a common problem in children, the etiology and mechanisms of the disorder have not been elucidated.

The study included 106 children with monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis and a control group of 57 children with no history of voiding dysfunction, aged 5 to 19 years. All children underwent urinalysis, bladder and upper urinary tract ultrasonography, and uroflowmetry. Ultrasonography was utilized to measure bladder capacity, bladder wall thickness, and postvoid residual volume. The findings were compared between the enuresis and control groups according to age: 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 to 19 years.

The mean age was 9.6 ± 3.1 years in the nocturnal enuresis group and 9.4 ± 3.3 years in the control group (P = 0.727). The mean number of defecations per week was statistically significantly lower in the enuresis group than in the control group in the age categories of 5 to 9 years and 10 to 14 years (P = 0.038 and P = 0.018, respectively). Additionally, the mean number of urinations per day was statistically significantly higher in the enuresis group than in the control group in the age groups of 5 to 9 years and 10 to 14 years (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). The bladder capacity, bladder wall thickness, postvoid residual volume, and results from uroflowmetry, such as maximal and average flow rates, were not significantly different between the groups.

### Nocturnal enuresis in adolescents with anorexia nervosa: prevalence, potential causes, and pathophysiology [^113rjFjM]. The International journal of eating disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and potential causes of secondary nocturnal enuresis (NE) in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN).

Method

Adolescents with AN completed the Incontinence Symptom Index-Pediatric (ISI-P), a self-report urinary incontinence survey. Those who had NE associated with the onset of AN on the ISI-P completed a comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluation, including urinary flow measurements.

Results

The prevalence of NE in adolescents with AN was 17.0% (10 of 59). The overall frequency of day- and night-time urinary incontinence symptoms in adolescents with AN was 62.7%; urgency incontinence, 57.6%; stress incontinence, 32.2%; and insensate incontinence, 17.0%. Nine of the 10 adolescents with NE had secondary NE and confirmed that bedwetting ceased after weight restoration.

Discussion

Decreased functional bladder capacity and detrusor instability may contribute to the NE observed in this population. The high prevalence of NE in adolescents with AN warrants further study to determine the potential causative pathways. Clinicians who work with adolescents with AN should assess for this problem.

### Childhood nocturnal enuresis: A marker for pelvic floor disorders and urinary tract symptoms in women [^117CyojG]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis - **Descriptive data**: Continuous variables were presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), and categorical data as number and percentage. The prevalence of different aspects of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) was calculated for all women. In each analysis, missing data were accounted for and excluded. Comparison between groups was analyzed with Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Student's t-test for continuous variables. Results were presented as number, percentage, 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-values.

- **Model adjustment**: No adjustment was made for multiple testing. The difference between groups was analyzed using a logistic regression model, taking age and BMI into account. Results were presented as adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Trend analysis**: The trend between independent age groups was analyzed with Mantel-Haenszel statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

### Prevalence and risk factors of nocturnal enuresis among children ages 5–12 years in Xi'an, China: a cross-sectional study [^111L4E5f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Childhood nocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to the symptoms of intermittent urinary incontinence during sleep, at a minimum age of 5 years, with a minimum duration of three months, and a minimum of one episode per month. The pathogenesis of NE is complex and multifactorial. Contributing elements include family history of NE, changes in antidiuretic hormone secretion rhythm, sleep disorders, retarded bladder maturity, immature nerve development, psychology, and environment.

In Egypt, Hamed et al. found that the prevalences of NE in rural and urban areas were 17.5% and 18.4%, respectively. In Turkey, the overall occurrence of NE was between 7.5% and 16.2%, while in Iran, the prevalence ranged from 8% to 18.7%. Furthermore, Ramírez-Backhaus et al. found that the prevalence of NE in Spanish school-age children was 7.8%. In China, NE prevalence was found to vary by region, ranging from 4.07% to 10.3%, and NE occurred more frequently in boys.

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: A comparative study [^112tZ1tm]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

We also found urinary frequency at night, including one or more than one episode of bedwetting per night, and abnormal residual volume as potential risk factors for enuresis, which are similar to the results of a study performed by Li et al. Similarly, intestinal disorders were found to be non-statistically significant in influencing enuresis. However, they did not investigate other factors affecting enuresis in our study.

Besides, we discovered that the treatment-resistant enuresis group had more cases with abnormal post-void residual volume compared to the controlled enuresis group. This is quite different from the findings of Hagstroem et al, where individuals with abnormal post-void residual volume were equally distributed between the two groups.

While our findings showed no significant difference in bowel movement disorders between groups, other studies have demonstrated a substantial relationship between constipation and nocturnal enuresis, with constipation management yielding significant enuresis improvement.

### Predictors and outcomes of childhood primary enuresis [^112NUuSk]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Although enuresis is relatively common in early childhood, research exploring its antecedents and implications is surprisingly limited, perhaps because the condition typically remits in middle childhood.

We examined the prevalence, predictors, prognostic factors, and outcomes of primary enuresis in a large (N = 559) multi-method, multi-informant prospective study with a community-based sample of children followed from age 3 years to age 9 years.

We found that 12.7% of our sample met criteria for lifetime enuresis, suggesting that it is a commonly occurring childhood disorder. Males were more than twice as likely as females to have a lifetime diagnosis. Significant age 3 predictors of developing primary enuresis by age 9 included child anxiety and low positive affectivity, maternal history of anxiety, and low authoritative parenting. In addition, poorer global functioning and more depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 3 years predicted a greater likelihood of persistence through age 9. By age 9 years, 77% of children who had received a diagnosis of primary enuresis were in remission and continent. However, children who had remitted exhibited a higher rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and greater ADHD and depressive symptoms at age 9 compared to children with no lifetime history of enuresis.

Results of the present study underscore the clinical significance of primary enuresis and demonstrate that it shows both strong antecedent and prospective associations with psychopathology.

### Prevalence of nocturnal enuresis and its influence on quality of life in school-aged children [^111qCR8k]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

According to the ICCS definitions, enuresis is defined as intermittent wetting during sleep after organic causes have been ruled out, with a minimum wetting frequency of once per month. Previous studies reported a prevalence rate of 9–12%. Eighty to 90% of enuresis cases are identified as primary enuresis, based on genetic predisposition, biological, and developmental factors. In contrast, secondary enuresis often arises from psychological factors. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of nocturnal enuresis (NE) among primary school children.

We initiated a prospective cross-sectional epidemiological study from January 2013 to May 2013 by sending a questionnaire to parents of 4,250 school children, aged 6–13 years. The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first part investigated the demographic characteristics of the child and family, such as age, gender, number of siblings, and the enuresis history of the parents and siblings. The second part included questions about the presence and frequency of bedwetting, presence of constipation/fecal incontinence, and presence of daytime incontinence (DI). The last part surveyed school performance and the effect of enuresis on the quality of life of parents and children. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the significant predictive factors for NE.

The overall prevalence of enuresis was 9.52%. The prevalence of NE among boys and girls was 12.4% and 6.5%, respectively. Daytime incontinence was present in 18% of children.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: A report of three cases and review [^114wXvjh]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, breath-holding episodes during sleep should be differentiated from nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders. When diagnosing nocturnal episodes, it is important to take into consideration that sleep-related choking syndrome and laryngospasm associated with GER may appear in the absence of other GERD symptoms. PSG is an essential tool for the evaluation of sleep abnormalities; however, PSG alone is not useful for differentiating nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders in children. Therefore, PSG with full-montage video-EEG and simultaneous 24-hour pH monitoring are important adjunct tools for diagnosing respiratory symptoms, such as breath spells, choking, and sudden coughing during sleep.

### Age of attaining nocturnal bladder control and adolescent suicidal behavior [^111NHMEQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis and delayed attainment of nocturnal bladder control are associated with an increased risk for psychopathology in children and adolescents. It has long been known that psychopathology is a major risk factor for youth suicide. However, no studies have examined the association between the age of attainment of nocturnal bladder control and adolescent suicidal behavior.

- **Methods**: A community sample of 1,920 adolescents aged 11–16 years from one prefecture of mainland China participated in the study. Parents completed a structured questionnaire including adolescents' developmental history, suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, aggressive behavior, and family environment.

- **Results**: Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that attaining nocturnal bladder control after 3 years was significantly associated with an increased risk for adolescent suicidal behavior, after controlling for a number of child and family covariates. A dose-response relationship between the age of attaining nocturnal bladder control and suicidal behavior was observed (OR = 2.1 for children attaining bladder control at 3–4 years and OR = 3.6 for children attaining bladder control at 5 years or later). Mediating models indicated that depression and aggressive behavior mediated, at least in part, the effect of delayed nocturnal bladder control on suicidal behavior.

- **Limitations**: This is a retrospective study. Suicidal behaviors were reported by parents.

Delayed nocturnal bladder control may be an earlier neurodevelopmental predictor of youth suicidal behavior. Further research is encouraged to explore this potential link.

### Practical recommendations of the EAU-ESPU guidelines committee for monosymptomatic enuresis-bedwetting [^114hFCM4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this update of the EAU-ESPU guidelines recommendations for nocturnal enuresis was to review the recently published literature, including studies, reviews, and guidelines, regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for nocturnal enuresis. The goal was to transform this information into a practical recommendation strategy for general practitioners, pediatricians, pediatric urologists, and urologists.

Since 2012, a monthly literature search using Scopus® has been performed. The relevant literature was reviewed and prospectively registered on the European Urology bedwetting enuresis resource center (http://bedwetting.europeanurology.com/). In addition, guideline papers and statements from the European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU), the European Association of Urology (EAU), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) were used to update the knowledge and evidence, resulting in this practical recommendation strategy. Recommendations have been discussed and agreed upon within the working group of the EAU-ESPU guidelines committee members.

The recommendations aim to place the child and their family in a position of control. A pragmatic analysis is made of the bedwetting problem by collecting information on voiding and drinking habits during the day, measuring nighttime urine production, and identifying possible risk factors such as high-volume evening drinking, nighttime overactive bladder, behavioral or psychological problems, or sleep-disordered breathing. A questionnaire may also be utilized to gather comprehensive data regarding these factors.

### Rls, PLM, and their differential diagnosis — a video guide [^112aXPbt]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

This video guide has been designed as an introduction to the full spectrum of nocturnal presentations of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements (PLM), along with their differential diagnoses. The DVD consists of four sections:

- **Clinical presentations of RLS**: Videos 1–3 cover the various clinical presentations of RLS.
- **Presentations of PLM**: Videos 4–14 demonstrate the typical and less frequent presentations of PLM.
- **Clinical presentation of augmentation**: Videos 15–19 show the clinical presentation of augmentation in RLS.
- **Differential diagnosis of RLS and PLM**: Videos 20–33 are dedicated to demonstrating nocturnal manifestations of other motor disorders during sleep, which must be distinguished from RLS and PLM. These include epilepsy, parasomnias, and other movement disorders of sleep.

After viewing this DVD, the reader should be able to: (1) appreciate the spectrum of voluntary and involuntary movements seen in patients with RLS during wakefulness; (2) recognize typical PLM during sleep in subjects with RLS and appreciate the enormous variability of clinical presentations of PLM; (3) describe specific and distinct aspects of motor activity in augmentation in patients with RLS; and (4) be aware of the most important differential diagnoses of RLS/PLM from a video or nocturnal motor activity perspective, namely, nocturnal epilepsy, parasomnias, and others.

### Evaluation and treatment of nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis: A standardization document from the International Children's Continence Society [^1177VMm2]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

This document represents the consensus guidelines recommended by the ICCS on evaluating and treating children with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). It is intended to be clinically useful in primary, secondary, and tertiary care.

- **Materials and methods**: Discussions were held by the board of the ICCS, and a committee was appointed to draft this document. The document was then made available to the society members on the website. Comments were vetted, and amendments were made as necessary.

- **Results**: The main scope of the document is the treatment of NMNE with drugs other than desmopressin-based therapy. Guidelines on the assessment and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of children with NMNE are presented.

- **Conclusions**: The text should be regarded as an expert statement, not a formal systematic review of evidence-based medicine. The evidence behind much of what we do in the care of enuretic children is quite weak. However, we intend to present what evidence exists and give preference to this rather than to experience-based medicine, whenever possible.

### Incontinence and sleep disturbances in young children: A population-based study [^11479UrW]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis (NE), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), fecal incontinence (FI), and sleep problems are common disorders in school-aged children. At least 25% of all children are affected by sleep problems. Many excellent studies on sleep and incontinence, both clinical and polysomnographic, have been published in the past decades. Most of these studies have focused on children with NE, as outlined by Pedersen et al. and Van Herzeele et al. Most episodes of NE occur early during sleep, in the first two-thirds of the night. NE episodes can occur in all sleep stages, especially in Stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep; wetting during REM stages is the exception. Preceding NE episodes, periods of arousal are typical in some children. Many children experience repeated transient arousals, leading to poor sleep quality and fragmentation. NE can be associated with circadian variations in blood pressure, heart-rate variability, vasopressin secretion, and urine production. NE in children is also associated with abnormalities in respiratory parameters and autonomic control. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and periodic limb movements (PLMS) have also been reported. Furthermore, children with NE are more difficult to arouse, a phenomenon commonly reported by parents.

In contrast to this extensive database, no studies have analyzed associations between DUI and sleep. One large, prospective population-based study analyzed which psychosocial risks influence later FI and/or constipation. Behavioral sleep problems at the age of 2−3 years were among the most influential factors.

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: A comparative study [^1127JGCc]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis remains a challenging pediatric condition that significantly impacts children's psychological and social well-being. Despite its prevalence, treatment outcomes are frequently suboptimal, with up to 50% of children demonstrating resistance to therapeutic approaches. This variability in treatment response underscores the critical need to understand the underlying factors that differentiate treatment-responsive from treatment-resistant patients.

While existing research has explored various aspects of enuresis, including physiological mechanisms and therapeutic interventions, a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing treatment outcomes remains elusive. Previous studies have suggested potential contributors to treatment resistance, such as comorbid psychiatric conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychological factors including diminished self-esteem, and organic pathologies such as constipation.

The complex nature of enuresis demands a multifaceted approach to investigation. Therapeutic strategies, including alarm therapy and pharmacological interventions like desmopressin and anticholinergics, have yielded inconsistent results. This inconsistency highlights the necessity of a more nuanced understanding of patient characteristics that may predict treatment response.

Accordingly, this study seeks to comprehensively examine the demographic, clinical, ultrasonographic, and psychological variables that distinguish treatment-resistant enuretic children from those who respond positively.

### Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) [^116ep1pH]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis, or bedwetting, is an old but still prevalent clinical problem in childhood and adolescence. Recent research has helped to correct some traditional misconceptions and unveil the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This article reviews recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and management strategy for enuresis.

- **Recent findings**: Nocturnal enuresis is a heterogeneous disorder with various underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, causing a mismatch between the nocturnal bladder capacity and the amount of urine produced during sleep at night, in association with a simultaneous failure of conscious arousal in response to the sensation of bladder fullness. Children with increased nocturnal urine production usually have a good response to desmopressin therapy. Patients with a small bladder almost invariably have various types of occult bladder dysfunction, but otherwise have a completely normal circadian rhythm of urine production. These patients generally have a poor response to desmopressin treatment but would benefit more from combination therapy with enuretic alarms, urotherapy, and antimuscarinic agents in addition to desmopressin.

- **Summary**: Various factors can potentially influence the balance between nocturnal urine production and functional bladder capacity. Different types of bladder dysfunction, resulting in a small nocturnal bladder capacity, probably contribute significantly to the pathogenesis, particularly in those with treatment failure and refractory symptoms.

### The effect of screen time on the presentation and treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^117TiCnT]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Patients in Group 3 reported complying with the rule of DST < 60 minutes throughout the study. The response to treatment measured at three months was determined as full response in 70% (14/20) in Group 3 and 31% (5/16) in Group 4 (p = 0.021). Failure in response to treatment was determined in 5% (1/21) in Group 3 and 30% (7/23) in Group 4 (p = 0.048). Recurrence at one month after the completion of treatment was determined at a lower rate in Group 3 where DST was restricted (7% vs. 60%, p = 0.037).

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: A comparative study [^112P37D5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides critical insights into the factors differentiating treatment-resistant from treatment-responsive nocturnal enuresis in children. The findings revealed that the prevalence of controlled nocturnal enuresis was higher than treatment-resistant cases. Factors such as deep sleep, daytime urinary control, and fluid management were more prevalent in children with controlled enuresis. In contrast, treatment-resistant cases were characterized by poor medication adherence, high urine volume per episode, and frequent enuresis.

Furthermore, a large volume of urine in each bedwetting episode, the child's cooperation in proper medication use, and deep sleep had the highest prevalence in both groups. Additionally, abnormal residual urine volume and one or more episodes of bedwetting per night were found to be statistically significant in affecting nocturnal enuresis.

These findings underscore the importance of individualized management strategies that address specific clinical and behavioral factors in treatment-resistant cases, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes. Longitudinal research is needed to assess long-term treatment efficacy and explore new therapeutic approaches, with a focus on improving outcomes for children with nocturnal enuresis.

### A novel method of rapid appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for children with enuresis [^111ddd1A]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Enuresis (bedwetting) is a common but variably managed pediatric condition. Despite an abundance of published documents that provide recommendations for clinical evaluation and management of enuresis, no formal appraisal of their methodological quality has been undertaken.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study is to evaluate the quality of pediatric guidelines for enuresis (bedwetting) using a novel method of appraisal.

- **Study design**: A comprehensive gray literature search was undertaken to identify guideline documents that provide recommendations for the management of enuresis in children and adolescents. The search strategy included guideline databases, targeted websites, Google search engines, and MEDLINE. Guideline documents included clinical practice guidelines, consensus documents, position statements, and other clinical review documents. Each document underwent basic appraisal by two independent assessors using the International Centre for Allied Health Evidence (iCAHE) Guideline Quality Checklist. Documents that (1) had an iCAHE quality score of ≥ 10, (2) used a systematic search strategy, and (3) linked evidence to their recommendations underwent further detailed appraisal using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.

- **Results**: Eighteen documents were shortlisted for basic appraisal. The iCAHE highlighted a lack of information regarding underlying evidence and dates (mean score 36% and 41%, respectively). Only three documents met basic quality criteria and progressed to detailed appraisal using the AGREE II instrument.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^114itHpD]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of enuresis, specifically concerning the indication for treatment, the EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend not to treat children under five years of age, as a spontaneous cure is likely. Families should be informed about the involuntary nature of enuresis, the high incidence of spontaneous resolution, and the fact that punishment will not help improve the condition.

### Nocturnal enuresis [^111dG2tg]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that can be troubling for children and their families. Recent studies indicate that nocturnal enuresis is best regarded as a group of conditions with different etiologies. A genetic component is likely in many affected children. Research also indicates the possibility of two subtypes of patients with nocturnal enuresis: those with a functional bladder disorder and those with a maturational delay in nocturnal arginine vasopressin secretion.

The evaluation of nocturnal enuresis requires a thorough history, a complete physical examination, and urinalysis. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Continence training should be incorporated into the treatment regimen. Use of a bed-wetting alarm has the highest cure rate and the lowest relapse rate; however, some families may have difficulty with this treatment approach. Desmopressin and imipramine are the primary medications used to treat nocturnal enuresis, but both are associated with relatively high relapse rates.

### Urodynamic findings in adults with primary nocturnal enuresis [^115wSTmV]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

We evaluate bladder function in adults with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) since childhood.

- **Materials and methods**: We recruited all patients older than 16 years who presented to our PNE clinic with persistent enuretic symptoms. All patients were assessed by a detailed voiding diary, uroflowmetry, and ultrasonography of the urinary tract. Urodynamic studies were performed for those with moderate or severe PNE (more than three wet nights a week).

- **Results**: The study included 18 males and 29 females with a mean age of 20 years (range 16 to 43). Of these patients, 37 (79%) had moderate or severe symptoms and 17 (38%) also had daytime urinary symptoms. Urodynamic studies were conducted in 30 patients, including 12 males and 16 females; 93% had detrusor overactivity. In addition, 73% of patients had urodynamic evidence of functional bladder outflow obstruction, including dysfunctional voiding and detrusor sphincter or detrusor pelvic discoordination. Two male patients (6.7%) had an obstructive pattern on urodynamics, and subsequent cystoscopic examination confirmed the presence of congenital obstructive urethral lesions. Sixteen patients (53%) had significantly reduced bladder capacity of less than 300 ml.

- **Conclusions**: Unlike in early childhood, the majority (79%) of enuretic adults had significant symptoms, and more than a third also had daytime urinary symptoms. We believe that PNE in adults is not only a psychologically disturbing condition but also a urological disorder with significant underlying bladder dysfunction that warrants special attention to management.

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: A comparative study [^113GaEjY]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 1, 144 children with nocturnal enuresis were studied within a 3-month period. Among them, 85 children were in the controlled enuresis group (Group 1), while 59 children were in the treatment-resistant enuresis group (Group 2). In Group 1, 57 (67.1%) were boys and 28 (32.9%) were girls, whereas in Group 2, 25 (42.4%) were boys, and 34 (57.6%) were girls. Moreover, as indicated in Table 1, only the gender value was found to be statistically significant (P-value < 0.05) in terms of demographic characteristics. The age distribution was slightly higher in the treatment-resistant group compared to the controlled enuresis group. The educational level of fathers in the treatment-resistant group was higher than in the controlled group; however, no significant differences were observed in the mothers' education levels or the employment status of either parent between the groups.

- **Demographic and parental characteristics**: In this section, we examined the prevalence of factors influencing nocturnal enuresis in two groups of children: those with controlled nocturnal enuresis and those with treatment-resistant nocturnal enuresis. Factors like deep sleep, daytime urinary control ability, excessive fluid intake before bedtime, a single episode of nocturnal enuresis per night, reduced frequency of nocturnal enuresis with fluid intake management, family history of nocturnal enuresis, prolonged intervals between urination, urinary frequency, post-void residual urine in the bladder, and frequent urination with small voids were considered.

### Current management of nocturnal enuresis [^115wb3o3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis is an especially common problem with the potential to have an appreciable negative impact on the emotional health of a child.

- **Recent findings**: Our understanding of the pathogenesis continues to improve. A disorder of sleep arousal, a low nocturnal bladder capacity, and nocturnal polyuria are the three factors that interrelate to cause nocturnal enuresis. Constipation is a very common and often unrecognized factor that appreciably affects bladder function.

- **Summary**: Successful treatment involves interventions that simultaneously improve these factors. Self-esteem improves with any form of therapy and dryness is possible for the majority of children.

### Accuracy and comprehensiveness of publicly-available online data about bedwetting: An actionable opportunity to improve parent and caregiver self-education [^1123wkNe]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is one of the most common reasons for referral to pediatric urologists. Prior to subspecialist visits, many parents seek electronically available information online to gather information about this condition and potential treatment options. Previous publications suggest that electronically available information on medical conditions does not always align with evidence-based or expert recommendations, raising the question of whether the same is true for MNE.

- **Objective**: To describe the content and accessibility of electronically available information on MNE and its alignment with recommendations from the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS-MNE).

- **Study design**: We simulated a layperson's electronic search using 10 pertinent search terms associated with bedwetting. We evaluated the first five pages (50 results) for each search. All publicly-available (non-paywalled) sites were assessed for concordance with ICCS-MNE in eight domains: increasing fluid intake, limiting bladder irritants, optimizing bowel habits, utilizing timed voiding, pelvic floor relaxation, endorsing alarm use, avoiding medications as standard first-line therapies, and pediatrician referral. Additionally, statements discouraging blaming or punishing the child were evaluated. Sites were classified as layperson-derived (blogs, communities/forums) or commercially-derived (medical institutions, commercial medical sites, corporations, government). Reading level was assessed by readable.io (compound scoring algorithms).

- **Results**: Of 500 pages, 410 (82%) met inclusion criteria.

### Atypical presentation of shock from acute adrenal insufficiency in an adolescent male [^11419315]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

To report an atypical presentation of shock and acute adrenal insufficiency in an adolescent male, we present the case of a 14-year-old boy with a history of nocturnal enuresis. He presented with a clinical picture suggestive of septic shock that was refractory to aggressive fluid and vasopressor management. The history and physical examination indicated shock secondary to an infectious etiology and were associated with skin findings of hyperpigmentation. Laboratory studies showed normal levels of sodium, potassium, glucose, and renin. Hydrocortisone therapy resulted in improvement of his blood pressure and allowed the weaning of vasopressor medications. Further laboratory studies, including an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test and adrenal antibodies, confirmed the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Acute adrenal insufficiency is an uncommon cause of shock in the adolescent population. We report a clinical presentation suggestive of shock secondary to acute adrenal insufficiency, remarkable for an atypical clinical and laboratory presentation. We further provide information on the management of acute adrenal crisis.

### Exploring clinical and urinary factors in treatment-resistant vs. treatment-responsive childhood enuresis: A comparative study [^11561h5K]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study has a limitation that should be considered when interpreting the findings. The relatively brief treatment duration and the cross-sectional design of this study restrict the ability to assess the prolonged efficacy of treatment strategies and the progression of treatment-resistant cases. Longitudinal studies with extended follow-up periods are essential to evaluate sustained treatment responses and identify additional factors contributing to resistance.

Despite this limitation, the study provides valuable insights into factors differentiating treatment-resistant from treatment-responsive nocturnal enuresis and highlights critical areas for future investigation.

### Enuresis in children: Common questions and answers [^114iSrqW]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Nocturnal enuresis is defined as nighttime urinary incontinence occurring at least twice weekly in children five years and older. Approximately 14% of children experience spontaneous resolution each year without treatment. Subtypes of nocturnal enuresis include nonmonosymptomatic enuresis and primary and secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Monosymptomatic enuresis is characterized by nighttime bedwetting without daytime urinary incontinence. The pathophysiology of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis may be due to sleep arousal disorder, overproduction of urine, small bladder storage capacity, or detrusor overactivity. Children with nonmonosymptomatic enuresis exhibit both daytime and nighttime symptoms resulting from a variety of underlying etiologies.

An in-depth history is an integral component of the initial evaluation. For all types of enuresis, a comprehensive physical examination and urinalysis should be performed to help identify the cause. It is important to reassure the family that bedwetting is not the child's fault.

- **Treatment options**: Treatment should begin with behavioral modification, which then progresses to enuresis alarm therapy and oral desmopressin. Enuresis alarm therapy is more likely to produce long-term success; desmopressin yields earlier symptom improvement. Treatment of secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis should primarily focus on the underlying etiology. Pediatric urology referral should be made for refractory cases in which underlying genitourinary anomalies or neurologic disorders are more likely.

### Seventeen-year-old female with history of depression presented with mania and enuresis [^116XYP1T]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old girl with a history of depression was referred by her psychologist to the emergency department (ED) because of concerning behavioral changes for the past 2 weeks. She was engaging in erratic behaviors, including excessive baking, handling broken glass, mixing chemicals, and swimming alone while clothed. She denied any intention to harm herself or others. She was feeling energized in the morning despite only sleeping a few hours at night. She also urinated on herself the day before her ED visit.

Her examination and preliminary testing findings in the ED were largely normal. Her initial presentation was concerning for a psychiatric etiology, such as new-onset bipolar disorder, given the previous history of depression and recent impulsive symptoms suggestive of mania. As her clinical course evolved and urinary incontinence continued, her definitive diagnosis was made by an interdisciplinary team that included child psychiatry and pediatric neurology.

### Assessment of readability and quality of patient education materials specific to nocturnal enuresis [^111PAN6r]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Bedwetting, or nocturnal enuresis (NE), is a common childhood disease. Families increasingly turn to free online resources for health education to navigate treatment options.

The objective is to determine the readability and quality of online health information that families may encounter when searching for information on pediatric NE. The study design involved querying the search term 'bedwetting' in commonly used search engines. Included articles were further categorized as institutional/reference, commercial, non-profit/charitable, or personal. An online readability platform calculated three commonly used readability assessments as well as a consensus score. Quality was assessed by two independent pediatric urologists using a validated DISCERN instrument. Differences in readability were further assessed by article category type.

A total of 36 websites were reviewed. Three did not include treatment options and were not included in the quality assessment. 55.6% of the articles were categorized as institutional/reference, 27.8% as non-profit/charitable, 11.1% as personal, and 5.6% as commercial. The average, standard deviation, and range of readability levels were as follows: overall consensus score = 9.56 ± 2.09, FK Grade Level Formula score = 9.38 ± 2.17 (range 5.8–14.1), SMOG Index score = 8.89 ± 1.79 (range 6.4–12.9), and the GF Index score = 11.86 ± 2.34 (range 8.4–16.9). The overall consensus score, 9.56, correlates to a 9th-grade reading level. According to the DISCERN instrument, 16 articles were considered to be of 'good' quality, 12 of 'fair' quality, and 5 of 'poor' quality.

### Prevalence and risk factors of nocturnal enuresis among children ages 5–12 years in Xi'an, China: A cross-sectional study [^1137cDv1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We also found that being female and having good academic performance were protective factors of nocturnal enuresis (NE), findings that agreed with another study. Genetic factors play a decisive role in NE, and the poor control of the nervous system over the bladder at night may be more heritable in boys than in girls, so boys are more likely to wet their beds than girls. In addition, bed-wetting has a negative effect on the body and mind, and it results in poor sleep quality in children with NE. This effect may cause enuretic children to be self-conscious and unable to concentrate on their studies, leading to poor academic performance.

NE has been closely associated with diaper dependence (DD) use, family income, and parental education level. However, in our study, the difference in parental education levels was not statistically significant. We found that the prevalence of NE varied with regions, with the highest in the southern suburb followed by the urban area. This regional variation might exist because of the rapid development of the economy in the southern suburb and urban area. We also found that with the widespread use of DD, younger children had used it much longer than the older ones. Due to increases in income, parents may prolong the use of DD and delay toilet training, thus promoting the occurrence of NE. Joinson et al. suggested that delayed toilet training (after 24 months) was likely to induce persistent urine accidents during the daytime. However, Hodges et al. found that children with early (before 24 months) or late (after 36 months) toilet training had more.

### Sleep-related breathing disorders and lower urinary tract dysfunction in children and adolescents: A scoping review [^113ZvWrH]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

If a child has a breathing problem at the age of 3.5 years, the odds ratio for a trajectory of daytime wetting (i.e. not enuresis alone) is increased. In addition, sleep problems observed in early childhood could be an indicator of difficulty obtaining bladder control in the future. The prevalence of enuresis in children with obstructive sleep apnea varies worldwide, ranging from 10% to 40% depending on the study characteristics. Additionally, there is a link between nocturnal polyuria, which is the excessive production of urine at night compared to daytime production, and sleep apnea in adults. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the increased prevalence rates of enuresis in children with obstructive sleep apnea could be related to nocturnal polyuria as well. This is especially relevant for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities, as the prevalence rates of both sleep apnea and incontinence are increased in this population. While children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities are more impacted by incontinence, those with certain genetic disorders and anatomical or physiological conditions are more predisposed to sleep apnea.

- **Clinical manifestations of sleep apnea**: Loud snoring, sense of asphyxiation, gasping for air, and excessive drowsiness are common clinical manifestations. Worldwide, approximately 1%–4% of children or adolescents under the age of 18 are expected to suffer from one of the above-mentioned sleep apnea disorders, with the most common form being obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy (e.g. enlarged tonsils) and obesity are particularly affected.
