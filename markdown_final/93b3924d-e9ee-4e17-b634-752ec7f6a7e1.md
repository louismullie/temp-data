## Question

How soon after a shingles outbreak can a patient get the shingrix vaccine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon after a shingles outbreak a patient can receive the Shingrix vaccine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the vaccine's mechanism and whether it treats acute shingles. Then, I should verify what ACIP and CDC say about timing after an acute episode. Next, I will check disease-specific guidance for immunocompromised patients, including people with HIV and cancer. After that, I need to consider practical clinical markers of illness resolution. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation and address common exceptions or special scenarios, making sure I cross-check each claim against authoritative sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the vaccine's role and mechanism, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating treatment with prevention. Shingrix is a nonlive, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine that prevents future herpes zoster; it is not a treatment for acute shingles, so giving it during an active episode would not help and could theoretically complicate assessment of adverse effects or reactogenicity, which is why guidelines advise against it during acute disease [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk] [^115PgcDV].

> Next, I should review the core ACIP/CDC guidance for immunocompetent adults. The recommendation is to delay Shingrix until the acute stage of herpes zoster is over and symptoms have abated; critically, there is no mandated minimum waiting period beyond that, so once the patient is clinically well, vaccination can proceed, typically as a 2-dose series 2–6 months apart [^112EPPQE] [^111gVXDQ].

> Wait, let me verify the immunocompromised guidance because timing nuances can differ. For adults with immunocompromising conditions, ACIP similarly instructs to delay vaccination until the acute episode is over and symptoms have abated; the dosing interval can be shortened to 1–2 months between doses when rapid protection is needed, but again, no specific minimum interval after illness resolution is prescribed beyond "until the acute illness is over" [^114FFxtk] [^116ptXWc].

> I will now examine disease-specific guidance to ensure consistency. In people with HIV, expert guidance aligns: do not administer Shingrix during an acute shingles episode; once the acute illness has resolved, proceed with the 2-dose series, ideally after virologic suppression and immune reconstitution if feasible, though the vaccine can be given regardless of CD4 count once the acute episode is over [^115PgcDV] [^1155aKhd] [^1132z87w].

> Hold on, I should verify oncology guidance as well. ASCO advises that patients who have experienced herpes zoster should receive Shingrix to prevent future episodes, with no specific waiting period required after resolution of the acute episode, reinforcing the principle of vaccinating as soon as the patient has recovered clinically [^116gVDoV].

> Let me consider practical clinical markers of resolution so I don't overgeneralize. Clinically, "acute stage over" generally means the rash has crusted and is healing, pain is improving and manageable, and there is no fever or systemic toxicity; if there is uncertainty about persistence or atypical features, a brief delay to ensure stability is reasonable, but prolonged deferral without indication is not recommended by ACIP or disease-specific guidelines [^notfound].

> But wait, what if someone proposes a fixed waiting window like 2–4 weeks after the last new lesion? I should double-check whether any guideline mandates that. I do not find a required minimum interval such as 2 or 4 weeks in ACIP, CDC, or disease-specific recommendations; the consistent instruction is to wait until the acute illness is over and symptoms abate, after which vaccination should be offered promptly to restore protection and reduce recurrence risk [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk] [^115PgcDV].

> Next, I should review the dosing schedule so I give the right interval advice. For immunocompetent adults, administer dose 2 of Shingrix 2–6 months after dose 1. For immunocompromised adults who would benefit from faster protection, dose 2 can be given 1–2 months after dose 1, with the caveat that if the second dose is administered too early (less than 4 weeks), it should be repeated to ensure validity, and the series does not need to be restarted if more than 6 months elapse after dose 1 [^111gVXDQ] [^116BB9NS] [^116ptXWc].

> I need to ensure I address a common misconception. Some clinicians recall older live zoster vaccine rules and worry about waiting months after shingles. However, Shingrix is a nonlive recombinant vaccine without the same timing constraints, and current guidance explicitly supports vaccination after recovery from a prior episode without a mandated delay beyond clinical resolution, which corrects that outdated thinking [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: administer Shingrix as soon as the acute shingles episode is over and symptoms have abated, using clinical judgment to confirm resolution. For immunocompetent adults, give the 2-dose series 2–6 months apart, and for immunocompromised adults who need faster protection, give the 2-dose series 1–2 months apart, ensuring the second dose is not given earlier than 4 weeks after the first. There is no required minimum waiting period after illness resolution beyond ensuring the patient is clinically well [^112EPPQE] [^111gVXDQ] [^116BB9NS] [^115PgcDV] [^116gVDoV].

Patients should receive Shingrix **once the acute shingles episode has resolved and symptoms have abated** [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk]. There is **no minimum waiting period** after resolution; the key is that the patient is no longer acutely ill. If antiviral therapy was used, wait until it is completed and the rash has healed. For immunocompromised patients, follow the same principle and use the 1–2 month interval between doses if rapid protection is needed [^116BB9NS]. Vaccination during active shingles is not recommended [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk].

## Clinical guidelines on timing of Shingrix vaccination after shingles

ACIP recommends administering Shingrix **after the acute episode has resolved and symptoms have abated** [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk]. There is **no minimum waiting period** after resolution; the key is that the patient is no longer acutely ill. If antiviral therapy was used, wait until it is completed and the rash has healed. For immunocompromised patients, follow the same principle and use the 1–2 month interval between doses if rapid protection is needed [^116BB9NS]. Vaccination during active shingles is not recommended [^112EPPQE] [^114FFxtk].

---

## Clinical rationale for delaying vaccination until after acute illness

Delaying vaccination until after the acute illness has resolved is recommended for the following reasons:

- **Immune response**: Vaccination during active infection may not elicit an optimal immune response due to ongoing viral replication and immune modulation.

- **Safety considerations**: Administering a vaccine during an active infection may increase the risk of adverse reactions or exacerbate symptoms.

- **Clinical assessment**: Waiting until symptoms abate allows for accurate assessment of the patient's clinical status and ensures that the acute episode has fully resolved.

---

## Evidence supporting vaccination after shingles resolution

Although no specific studies have evaluated the exact timing of Shingrix vaccination after shingles resolution, clinical trials and real-world data support vaccination after shingles:

- **Efficacy**: Shingrix has demonstrated high efficacy (> 90%) in preventing shingles and its complications, including postherpetic neuralgia, in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years [^114ftVaY] [^114JvMqd].

- **Safety**: Shingrix has a favorable safety profile, with no significant increase in serious adverse events compared to placebo in clinical trials [^111wGZYi] [^114JvMqd].

- **Immunogenicity**: Shingrix induces robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, providing durable protection against shingles [^113PwWq1] [^117HbiwF].

---

## Special considerations for immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of shingles and its complications; therefore, vaccination is particularly important. ACIP recommends that immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years receive Shingrix in a **2-dose series**, with the second dose administered 1–2 months after the first if rapid protection is needed [^116BB9NS]. Vaccination should still be delayed until the acute shingles episode has resolved and symptoms have abated [^114FFxtk].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current guidelines and clinical evidence, the following practical recommendations are suggested:

- **Wait until resolution**: Administer Shingrix only after the acute shingles episode has resolved and symptoms have abated [^112EPPQE].

- **No specific waiting period**: There is no specific minimum waiting period after resolution of shingles. The key consideration is that the patient is no longer acutely ill [^116gVDoV].

- **Complete antiviral therapy**: Ensure that any antiviral therapy initiated for shingles has been completed and the rash has healed before vaccination.

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Follow the same principle of delaying vaccination until after resolution of the acute episode [^114FFxtk]. Consider the shortened interval between doses if rapid protection is needed [^116BB9NS].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Timing of shingrix vaccination after shingles** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompetent adults | Administer after resolution of acute episode and abatement of symptoms [^112EPPQE] |
| Immunocompromised adults | Administer after resolution of acute episode; consider shortened interval between doses if rapid protection needed [^116BB9NS] |
| General recommendation | No specific waiting period; vaccinate once acute illness has resolved [^116gVDoV] |

### Immunogenicity of adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with upadacitinib: 60-week results from a randomised controlled trial substudy [^112CkrhU]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are approximately twice as likely to develop infections compared with those without RA. This increased susceptibility can be attributed to various factors, such as immune dysfunction due to RA, comorbid conditions and the use of immunosuppressive therapies like corticosteroids (CSs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which can include conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Of particular concern is the heightened risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ), an opportunistic infection resulting from the reactivation of the dormant varicella-zoster virus infection. Studies have shown that patients with RA have a two- to almost threefold higher risk of developing HZ compared with the general population. Moreover, recent research has highlighted that the use of JAK inhibitors for treating moderately to severely active RA is associated with an elevated incidence rate of HZ, with rates of 2.8 per 100 patient-years reported for tofacitinib and baricitiniband 3.0 to 5.3 per 100 patient-years for upadacitinib. To provide optimal patient care and minimise the risk of infections in RA, it is important to prioritise infection prevention, with vaccination serving as a valuable strategy to stimulate and enhance protective immunity. Recognising the increased risk of vaccine-preventable infections, the American College of Rheumatologyand the European League Against Rheumatismrecommend vaccination for immunosuppressed adults with RA. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasise the importance of using the non-live adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix GlaxoSmithKline; approved 2017) for preventing HZ in adults aged 50 years or older.

Furthermore, results from clinical trialsand real-world evidence studieshave shown the efficacy and safety of RZV in healthy and immunocompromised adults; however, the biological effects of RZV in patients with RA receiving JAK inhibitors, particularly those receiving upadacitinib with background methotrexate, have not been well studied. To gain a better understanding of vaccination response and optimise vaccination strategies for patients with RA, short- and long-term data on the immunogenicity of RZV are needed. Therefore, the objective of this analysis was to evaluate the immunogenicity of RZV through week 60 in patients with RA who were receiving upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and background methotrexate.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^1129LaiG]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella zoster, commonly referred to as chickenpox, is a respiratory infectious disease that causes a characteristic red rash and pox on the skin surface. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which also causes shingles, often referred to as herpes zoster. Chickenpox symptoms typically arise 1–3 weeks after exposure to an infected individual, and a newly infected individual is infectious for around a week starting 1–2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptoms last approximately 2 weeks, when the virus then retreats to the nerve ganglia in the spine. By the age of 15, nearly all children have antibodies to VZV, whether from a natural infection or vaccine. In 10–30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles, typically in adults aged over 60. The VZV vaccine prevents infection with VZV in children while a booster dose, referred to as a shingles vaccine, later in life suppresses VZV reactivation in adults.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine confers long-term protection against herpes zoster: interim results of an extension study of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 [^115LmPzS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results have some limitations but also some strengths. Almost half of the former ZOE-50/70 participants did not enroll in this LTFU study. However, this is likely due to the age of former ZOE-50/70 participants (mean age > 67 years at vaccination in ZOE-50/70) and the time between vaccination in ZOE-50/70 and the start of this follow-up study (5 years). At the data lock point for the present interim analysis, not all participants had reached Y8 post-vaccination, and since the follow-up is ongoing, precision of the vaccine efficacy estimate and the sample size for immunogenicity assessments for this time point will increase in subsequent analyses. Participants will be followed through 11 years post-vaccination, and final data will confirm whether the observed plateaus in immune responses and vaccine efficacy persist. While HZ cases that occurred during the ZOE-50/70 and this LTFU study were ascertained according to the same strict protocol, those that occurred during the 1-year gap between the ZOE-50/70 and this LTFU study were only recorded at enrollment, without being confirmed per the same protocol. Therefore, vaccine efficacy for Y5 could not be estimated. This LTFU study did not have a concomitant placebo group, as placebo recipients from ZOE-50/70 had received RZV in a subsequent study. Hence, we used HZ incidences from the placebo group of the ZOE-50/70 studies (adjusted for age and region at randomization in ZOE-50/70) to calculate vaccine efficacy in the present LTFU study. While previous long-term immunogenicity data were generated in a population of approximately 70 White adults vaccinated at age ≥ 60 years, our immunogenicity data were generated along with efficacy data on a larger and racially more heterogeneous population that also included adults aged 50–59 years at vaccination, suggesting that our results may be generalized to a broader population.

### Effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster in a real-world setting [^115UnS7T]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A 2-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 97% effective against herpes zoster (HZ) in a pivotal clinical trial.

Objective

To evaluate real-world effectiveness of RZV against HZ.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Four health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink.

Participants

Persons aged 50 years or older.

Measurements

The outcome was incident HZ defined by a diagnosis with an antiviral prescription. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard of HZ in vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons, with adjustment for covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 minus the adjusted hazard ratio and was estimated by time since the last RZV dose and by corticosteroid use.

Results

The study included nearly 2.0 million persons who contributed 7.6 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment, VE of 1 dose was 64% and VE of 2 doses was 76%. After 1 dose only, VE was 70% during the first year, 45% during the second year, 48% during the third year, and 52% after the third year. After 2 doses, VE was 79% during the first year, 75% during the second year, and 73% during the third and fourth years. Vaccine effectiveness was 65% in persons who received corticosteroids before vaccination and 77% in those who did not.

Limitation

Herpes zoster could not be identified as accurately in these observational data as in the previous clinical trials.

Conclusion

Two doses of RZV were highly effective, although less effective than in the previous clinical trials. Two-dose effectiveness waned very little during the 4 years of follow-up. However, 1-dose effectiveness waned substantially after 1 year, underscoring the importance of the second dose.

### Safety of herpes zoster vaccine in the shingles prevention study: a randomized trial [^115t1buQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent older adults. However, its safety has not been described in depth.

Objective

To describe local adverse effects and short- and long-term safety profiles of herpes zoster vaccine in immunocompetent older adults.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with enrollment from November 1998 to September 2001 and follow-up through April 2004 (mean, 3.4 years). A Veterans Affairs Coordinating Center generated the permutated block randomization scheme, which was stratified by site and age. Participants and follow-up study personnel were blinded to treatment assignments. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00007501)

Setting

22 U.S. academic centers.

Participants

38 546 immunocompetent adults 60 years or older, including 6616 who participated in an adverse events substudy.

Intervention

Single dose of herpes zoster vaccine or placebo.

Measurements

Serious adverse events and rashes in all participants and inoculation-site events in substudy participants during the first 42 days after inoculation. Thereafter, vaccination-related serious adverse events and deaths were monitored in all participants, and hospitalizations were monitored in substudy participants.

Results

After inoculation, 255 (1.4%) vaccine recipients and 254 (1.4%) placebo recipients reported serious adverse events. Local inoculation-site side effects were reported by 1604 (48%) vaccine recipients and 539 (16%) placebo recipients in the substudy. A total of 977 (56.6%) of the vaccine recipients reporting local side effects were aged 60 to 69 years, and 627 (39.2%) were older than 70 years. After inoculation, herpes zoster occurred in 7 vaccine recipients versus 24 placebo recipients. Long-term follow-up (mean, 3.39 years) showed that rates of hospitalization or death did not differ between vaccine and placebo recipients.

Limitations

Participants in the substudy were not randomly selected. Confirmation of reported serious adverse events with medical record data was not always obtained.

Conclusion

Herpes zoster vaccine is well tolerated in older, immunocompetent adults.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^116BPQK5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a 2-dose (0.5 mL each) subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with adjuvant (AS01 B) that was licensed in the United States for prevention of herpes zoster for adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2017* (1). On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for herpes zoster because of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy (2). On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended 2 doses of RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years † who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy. RZV is the first herpes zoster vaccine approved for use in immunocompromised persons. With moderate to high vaccine efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, RZV has the potential to prevent considerable herpes zoster incidence and related complications. This report updates previous ACIP recommendations for the prevention of herpes zoster (1,3).

### Immunogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine: persistence and anamnestic response to additional doses administered 10 years after primary vaccination [^116h3Bms]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Between 9 and 10 years after initial vaccination, no vaccine-related SAEs were reported. During the current study and the previous follow-up study, covering the period between 4 and 6 years, 6 and 9 years, and up to 10 years after initial vaccination, suspected HZ cases were reported in 2 of ≥ 70 participants. One case had polymerase chain reaction testing, and results proved negative for VZV; the other had no such testing. Neither case was assessed by an adjudication committee, and HZ cases were not actively sought in these studies.

The ability of a vaccine to induce an anamnestic response is reflected by a rapid and strong immune response elicited in an individual with a previously developed primary immune response to the vaccine's antigen(s). To assess the ability of RZV to induce anamnestic immune responses in previous RZV recipients, 2 additional doses were administered 2 months apart, 10 years after the initial 2-dose vaccination course. This also allowed assessment of the safety of repeated RZV administration. Both the anti-gE antibody GMC and the median CD4 2+ T-cell frequency increased substantially after the first additional dose, to higher levels than those elicited by the second dose of the initial vaccination course, revealing the ability of RZV to induce strong anamnestic immune responses. By contrast to the initial 2-dose schedule, for which humoral and CMI responses were higher after dose 2 than after dose 1, no further increases were observed after the second additional dose. Hence, the ability of RZV to induce strong anamnestic immune responses was shown after a single additional dose.

The persistence of immune responses through 1 year after the additional vaccination course was higher for the anti-gE antibody GMCs and similar for the median CD4 2+ T-cell frequency compared with the initial vaccination course. Long-term efficacy (NCT02723773) and real-world data will enable further assessment of the duration of protection offered by RZV and could help determine the need and optimal timing for additional dosing. The long-term follow-up and revaccination study (NCT02723773), which is currently ongoing, also aims to compare revaccination with 1 or 2 RZV doses. These future data may help us understand whether the anamnestic response induced by the first additional dose reaches a maximum that cannot be further increased by a second additional dose given 2 months after the first additional dose, potentially owing to homeostatic control mechanisms.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1155aKhd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster vaccine — For people with HIV aged ≥ 18 years, administer two doses of recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (RZV) at 0 and 2 to 6 months (AIII). Consider delaying vaccination until the patient is virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or until the CD4 count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 to ensure a robust vaccine response (CIII). People with HIV aged ≥ 18 years should receive RZV regardless of previous history of herpes zoster or previous receipt of zoster vaccine live (no longer available). Do not give RZV during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII), and RZV is not recommended during pregnancy (AIII). Herpes zoster vaccine has not been studied for prevention against primary varicella infection.

### Zoster vaccine: current status and future prospects [^117PL2zJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Live, attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (zoster vaccine) protects immunocompetent adults from herpes zoster and its complications. Success of zoster vaccine in preventing the clinical manifestations of latent VZV reactivation contrasts with the failure to achieve similar results with vaccination to prevent recurrent herpes simplex. This reflects major differences in the pathophysiology of latency and reactivation of these 2 alphaherpesviruses. The Shingles Prevention Study and many others have demonstrated that VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, but not VZV antibody, plays a critical role in limiting reactivation and replication of latent VZV and, thus, in preventing herpes zoster and its complications. Consequently, induction of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity and not antibody should be used as a proxy for the clinical efficacy of new formulations and uses of zoster vaccine. Prospects for improved zoster vaccines and their use in immunocompromised patients are discussed, and questions related to zoster vaccine use are addressed.

### Persistence of the efficacy of zoster vaccine in the shingles prevention study and the short-term persistence substudy [^117EyZvn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Shingles Prevention Study (SPS; Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 403) demonstrated that zoster vaccine was efficacious through 4 years after vaccination. The Short-Term Persistence Substudy (STPS) was initiated after the SPS to further assess the persistence of vaccine efficacy.

Methods

The STPS re-enrolled 7320 vaccine and 6950 placebo recipients from the 38 546-subject SPS population. Methods of surveillance, case determination, and follow-up were analogous to those in the SPS. Vaccine efficacy for herpes zoster (HZ) burden of illness, incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and incidence of HZ were assessed for the STPS population, for the combined SPS and STPS populations, and for each year through year 7 after vaccination.

Results

In the STPS as compared to the SPS, vaccine efficacy for HZ burden of illness decreased from 61.1% to 50.1%, vaccine efficacy for the incidence of PHN decreased from 66.5% to 60.1%, and vaccine efficacy for the incidence of HZ decreased from 51.3% to 39.6%, although the differences were not statistically significant. Analysis of vaccine efficacy in each year after vaccination for all 3 outcomes showed a decrease in vaccine efficacy after year 1, with a further decline thereafter. Vaccine efficacy was statistically significant for the incidence of HZ and the HZ burden of illness through year 5.

Conclusions

Vaccine efficacy for each study outcome was lower in the STPS than in the SPS. There is evidence of the persistence of vaccine efficacy through year 5 after vaccination but, vaccine efficacy is uncertain beyond that point.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114bPkGF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster vaccination — one U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine is available for prevention in immunocompetent adults. In 2017, a subunit vaccine containing recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) and adjuvant AS01B, the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix), was FDA approved and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to prevent herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years, given on a 2-dose schedule. Pivotal Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving > 30,000 participants aged ≥ 50 years showed vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster of 97.2% overall and 91.3% in those aged ≥ 70 years. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain (78% of recipients), myalgia (45%), and fatigue (45%), with Grade 3 injection site reactions reported in 9.4% of vaccine recipients.

### Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^112EPPQE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, immunocompetent adults, CDC 2018 guidelines recommend to offer recombinant zoster vaccine in adults with a history of HZ. Delay the vaccination in patients experiencing an episode of HZ until the acute stage of the illness is over and symptoms abate.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

Studies of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of herpes zoster vaccines in defined immunocompromised populations are ongoing. ACIP will consider these data as they become available and revise recommendations accordingly. In addition, CDC will monitor coverage of RZV and adherence to the 2-dose schedule. Short-term and long-term effectiveness of RZV will be assessed through longitudinal studies of clinical trial participants as well as through observational studies.

As with all new vaccines, CDC will monitor adverse events following immunization through VAERS and the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Additional post-marketing safety monitoring will include studies conducted by GSK and reported to the FDA. Monitoring RZV is particularly important given the vaccine's novel adjuvant and its high reactogenicity and immunogenicity.

Timing of RZV for persons previously vaccinated with ZVL. Age and time since receipt of ZVL may be considered to determine when to vaccinate with RZV. Studies examined the safety and immunogenicity of RZV vaccination administered ≥ 5 years after ZVL; shorter intervals have not been studied. However, there are no data or theoretical concerns to indicate that RZV would be less safe or less effective when administered at an interval of < 5 years. Clinical trials indicated lower efficacy of ZVL in adults aged ≥ 70 years; therefore, a shorter interval may be considered based on the recipient's age when ZVL was administered. Based on expert opinion, RZV should not be given < 2 months after receipt of ZVL.

Coadministration with other vaccines. CDC's general best practice guidelines for immunization advise that recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vaccines. Concomitant administration of RZV with Fluarix Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine) (QIV) has been studied, and there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to either vaccine or safety concerns. Evaluation of coadministration of RZV with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax23) and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap, Boostrix) is ongoing. The safety and efficacy of administration of two adjuvanted vaccines (e.g. RZV and adjuvanted influenza vaccine [Fluad]), either concomitantly or at other intervals, have not been evaluated.

Counseling for reactogenicity. Before vaccination, providers should counsel RZV recipients about expected systemic and local reactogenicity. Reactions to the first dose did not strongly predict reactions to the second dose; vaccine recipients should be encouraged to complete the series even if they experienced a grade 1–3 reaction to the first dose of RZV. The impact of prophylactic analgesics in conjunction with RZV has not been studied.

### Association between immunogenicity and reactogenicity: a post hoc analysis of 2 phase 3 studies with the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine [^114JGnwW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A recurrent question is whether transient reactions to vaccines translate into better immune responses. Using clinical data from 2 large phase 3 studies of the recombinant zoster vaccine, we observed a small but statistically significant association between the intensity of a frequent side effect (pain) after vaccination and immune responses to vaccination. However, despite the statistical correlation, the impact on the immune response is so small, and the immune response in individuals without pain already sufficient, that pain cannot be a surrogate marker for an appropriate immune response. Reactogenicity cannot be used to predict immunity after vaccination.

### Postlicensure safety surveillance of recombinant zoster vaccine (shingrix)-United States, October 2017-June 2018 [^111wGZYi]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix), an adjuvanted glycoprotein vaccine, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for adults aged ≥ 50 years in October 2017 (1). The previously licensed live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax) is recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. RZV is administered intramuscularly as a 2-dose series, with an interval of 2–6 months between doses. In prelicensure clinical trials, 85% of 6,773 vaccinated study participants reported local or systemic reactions after receiving RZV, with approximately 17% experiencing a grade 3 reaction (erythema or induration > 3.5 inches or systemic symptoms that interfere with normal activity). However, rates of serious adverse events (i.e., hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death) were similar in the RZV and placebo groups (2). After licensure, CDC and FDA began safety monitoring of RZV in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (3). During the first 8 months of use, when approximately 3.2 million RZV doses were distributed (GlaxoSmithKline, personal communication, 2018), VAERS received a total of 4,381 reports of adverse events, 130 (3.0%) of which were classified as serious. Commonly reported signs and symptoms included pyrexia (fever) (1,034; 23.6%), injection site pain (985; 22.5%), and injection site erythema (880; 20.1%). No unexpected patterns were detected in reports of adverse events or serious adverse events. Findings from early monitoring of RZV are consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure clinical trials.

### Time to talk to adults with rheumatic diseases about herpes zoster vaccination [^113hBzNY]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations on herpes zoster vaccination for adult patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases stated that these patients are at increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population. However, these recommendations lack clarity and specificity and are cautiously phrased, which might cause physicians to underestimate the importance of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients, potentially resulting in suboptimal protection. Since the formulation of the 2019 EULAR guidelines, new data on herpes zoster in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been published. Moreover, a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) has become available that can be given to these patients in a more accessible manner than the original live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax). Here, we evaluate existing evidence on risk factors for herpes zoster and the safety and efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and discuss the necessity of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^112u5MqW]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The chickenpox vaccine was first approved for use in the USA in 1995. Despite its successful use for a quarter century, global VZV vaccination policy remains a topic of much debate. It is a live-attenuated vaccine administered in two doses during childhood. The shingles vaccine is either a single (Zostovax) or double (Shingrix) dose recombinant vaccine given later-in-life to suppresses reactivation. Chickenpox vaccination is only used in a limited number of countries, and there are multiple reasons why most countries have not yet implemented vaccination. First, complications from chickenpox are rare, with less than 1% of infected individuals experiencing severe illness. Second, childhood immunization against VZV has been hypothesized to reduce natural VZV exposure in adults. This reduction of VZV exposure could then reduce VZV immune-boosting, which would cause additional reactivation. Third, low and intermediate levels of chickenpox vaccine coverage would shift the age distribution of chickenpox infection onto older age groups who would carry a higher burden of disease. Severe complications become more common in individuals who contract chickenpox at an older age. Fourth, as with other vaccine-preventable diseases, it is likely that natural infection provides longer immunity than a vaccine dose. Despite the complexities surrounding VZV vaccination, some countries have chosen to vaccinate. Although the percent of infections resulting in serious illness is low, when endemic VZV infects the majority, vaccination prevents a substantial number of serious cases (e.g. hospitalizations). For instance, vaccination prevents an estimated 4 million cases each year in the United States, and 1% of those averted cases (approximately 40,000) would have been serious illness.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1132z87w]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Zoster vaccination — Indication is age ≥ 18 years, regardless of a past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of attenuated ZVL (Zostavax). Recommendations list a two-dose (0.5 mL IM) series of RZV (Shingrix) IM 2–6 months apart (AIII). RZV is not recommended in pregnancy (AIII). To maximize immunologic response to the vaccine, consider delaying vaccination until patient is virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or wait for immune reconstitution in those who had a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (CIII). Do not give RZV (Shingrix) during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). ACIP recommends RZV for adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be at risk for herpes zoster.

Concise clinical guidance use and scope — Shared decision-making should be utilized to ensure optimal patient care decisions are made, and these decisions should jointly reflect patient preference and those of the managing clinician, especially in areas of management uncertainty. This CCG does not supersede good clinical judgment, and the clinician should seek input as needed from relevant experts. Although this CCG focuses on respiratory vaccinations, the writing committee acknowledges emerging evidence suggesting that other vaccines — such as the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine — may offer cardiovascular protective benefits. This CCG is based on the best data currently available, with new information to inform guidance being rapidly generated; these updates will influence the considerations presented in the document, and it is essential that clinicians stay current with emerging evidence and updates following the publication of this CCG.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^1172ud3k]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

CDC will monitor adverse events following RZV immunization through VAERS, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and observational studies. This is particularly important given the heterogeneity of herpes zoster risk within and across immunocompromised groups and the novel adjuvant and high rates of reactogenicity of the vaccine. Limited data for outcomes deemed important by the work group (e.g. possible graft rejection, graft-versus-host-disease, immune-mediated disease) highlight the need for additional research. Additional post-marketing monitoring will include studies conducted by GSK and reported to FDA. Continued monitoring of the impact of the U.S. varicella and herpes zoster vaccination programs on herpes zoster epidemiology will be important to guide future herpes zoster vaccination recommendations.

### Review of the persistence of herpes zoster vaccine efficacy in clinical trials [^111es85q]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine(*) was approved for the prevention of shingles in 2006. Initial Phase III clinical trials proved vaccine efficacy persisted during the study duration; however, assessment of long-term efficacy required additional studies. This article reviews efficacy data for the zoster vaccine that have been published since 2004. It focuses on studies assessing declining vaccine efficacy.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were searched for zoster vaccine efficacy trials. Randomized controlled trials published from 2004 to 2015 were included in the review.

Findings

Six studies were included in the review. The zoster vaccine reduced the risk of herpes zoster by 51.3% to 72.4% in 2 Phase III trials. Primary and other analyses showed the vaccine was effective at reducing the burden of illness (61.1%), postherpetic neuralgia (66.5%), disease interference on functional status (66.2%), and disease impact on health-related quality of life (55%) compared with placebo. Surveillance studies showed a decrease in vaccine efficacy for reducing the incidence of herpes zoster during follow-up years 3.3 to 7.8 (39.6% relative reduction) and 4.7 to 11.6 (21.1% relative reduction).

Implications

Initial zoster vaccine efficacy is significant, but declines in post-vaccination years 3 to 11. This raises the question about the need for possible revaccination with the zoster vaccine. Clinicians should consider the declining efficacy when administering the zoster vaccine to patients. Future studies will need to address the impact of the varicella vaccine on the incidence of shingles and whether this impacts the efficacy of the zoster vaccine.

### Final analysis of the ZOE-LTFU trial to 11 years post-vaccination: efficacy of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster and related complications [^111Ehwr1]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

VE analysis

To construct the historical control, age stratum specific incidence rates (per age at vaccination at ZOE-50/70) were estimated with a Poisson regression model (adjusted for region), and the resulting incidence rates were multiplied by the actual follow-up time observed in the ZOE-LTFU study to obtain the predicted number of HZ cases for the historical control. The same sample size and follow-up time as the vaccinated group were assumed for the historical control to ensure that the two groups were comparable. The same approach was taken for historical control construction in both yearly and overall VE calculations.

A Poisson regression model was used to estimate VE and associated 95% CIs overall and by age strata (50–59, 60–69, 70–79, ≥ 70, and ≥ 80 years of age at vaccination), considering region as a fixed effect. The time at risk for each participant ended at the time of the first or only event of interest; or at the time of receiving any non-protocol HZ vaccination; or at the latest visit for which data were available for participants who did not experience an event (i.e. the earliest of the date of withdrawal, death, or study conclusion). For the annual VE estimates and the VE estimate from 1 month after the second vaccine dose to the end of the ZOE-LTFU study, calculations for Year 1–Year 4 used actual incidence rates from the ZOE-50/70 placebo arm, and calculations for Year 6 onwards used the estimated rates for the historical control. Any suspected HZ cases occurring during the gap period were recorded, but were not considered in the VE analysis of ZOE-LTFU, because HZ cases could not be confirmed per protocol requirements. Hence, it was not possible to estimate VE during the gap period. A sensitivity analysis including HZ cases identified during the gap period was also done.

### Adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E herpes zoster vaccine [^114ftVaY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine is superior to the live attenuated HZ vaccine, with an efficacy > 90% against HZ in healthy immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years after vaccination. In pivotal studies, the efficacy of the new vaccine varied very little with the age of the vaccinee and decreased only by 5–10% in the 3.5 years after immunization. This nonlive vaccine was successfully administered to small cohorts of immunocompromised individuals; initial trials showed efficacy of > 60–80% in several such settings. Potential drawbacks include the requirement for 2 vaccine doses separated by 2–6 months, local and systemic reactogenicity that is significantly greater than observed with commonly used vaccines, and the inclusion of a strong adjuvant that has been minimally studied in clinical settings where it might be problematic, such as in people with autoimmune diseases. Postmarketing studies are underway to address some of the drawbacks.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^113u1Hg4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

RSV Vaccination Timing

RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

Vaccine Administration, Including Coadministration with Other Vaccines

Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. *Available data on immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity. Data are lacking on the safety of coadministration with other vaccines that might be recommended for persons in this age group, such as COVID-19 vaccines; pneumococcal vaccines; adult tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines; and the recombinant zoster vaccine (the recombinant zoster vaccine and GSK's RSV vaccine contains the same adjuvant). When deciding whether to coadminister other vaccines with an RSV vaccine, providers should consider whether the patient is up to date with currently recommended vaccines, the feasibility of the patient returning for additional vaccine doses, risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine reactogenicity profiles, and patient preferences. Postlicensure efficacy and safety monitoring of coadministered RSV vaccines with other vaccines will further direct guidance.

Precautions and Contraindications

As with all vaccines, RSV vaccination should be delayed for persons experiencing moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (precaution). RSV vaccines are contraindicated for and should not be administered to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any component of the vaccine.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^114jH2MP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In both study groups, while the proportion of CD4 T cells expressing 3 or 4 activation markers (polyfunctional CD4 T cells) increased after each RZV dose and remained above prevaccination levels at 12 months after dose 2, the proportion of CD4 T cells expressing a single activation marker decreased after each RZV dose and remained below the prevaccination level at 12 months after dose 2 (Figure 2B).

Expression of activation markers was similar in the 2 study groups. At all time points, CD40L (alone or especially in combination with other markers) was expressed in the vast majority of gE-specific CD4 T cells. IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α were usually expressed in combination with IL-2 and/or CD40L. The frequencies of CD4 T cells expressing individual and combinations of 2, 3, or 4 activation markers peaked 1 month after dose 2 and decreased thereafter, except for the frequency of those expressing CD40L alone, which peaked 12 months after dose 2 (Figure 2C). In both study groups, exploratory analyses showed a statistically significant positive correlation between anti-gE concentrations and gE-specific CD4 2+ T-cell frequencies at all time points, which was highest at 1 month after dose 2 (Supplementary Table 1).

From RZV dose 1 through 12 months after dose 2, ≥ 1 SAE was reported by 18 (8.4%; 95% CI, 5.0%–12.9%) and 22 (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.5%–15.1%) participants from the HZ-PreVac and HZ-NonVac groups, respectively. Fatal SAEs were reported for 2 of 215 participants from the HZ-PreVac and 3 of 215 from the HZ-NonVac group. At least 1 pIMD was reported by 2 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.1–3.3%) and 4 (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.5%–4.7%) participants from the HZ-PreVac and HZ-NonVac groups, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). None of the reported SAEs or pIMDs were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

During the entire study period, 1 suspected HZ episode was reported, which occurred in a HZ-PreVac group participant approximately 160 days after dose 2. Although both the investigator and the HZ ascertainment committee ascertained the case as HZ, this diagnosis was ruled out by PCR.

### Herpes zoster frequency and adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccination after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [^115VLK15]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevention of Herpes Zoster (HZ) is of prime importance in patients post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Shingrix, an inactivated, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (aRZV) is now available and recommended to prevent HZ in seropositive immunocompromised patients. Safety and efficacy for this vaccine has been established in autologous HCT and other immunocompromised patients, however, for alloHCT recipients, limited data exists.

Objectives

The primary outcome was the frequency of HZ occurring in patients post alloHCT in those who received aRZV vaccination compared with those who did not receive aRZV. Other characteristics of interest included the clinical presentation of HZ, treatment, and outcomes related to the HZ episode.

Study Design

A single-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada between April 1 2018 - May 1 2024. Adult patients were included from a prospective registry if they underwent alloHCT from April 1 2018 - Dec 31 2022. Follow up was censored at time of death, 90 days post first episode of HZ, loss to follow-up, end of study period or 36 months post alloHCT. Data was systematically collected from the electronic medical record or registry. A confirmed HZ episode was defined by clinical and/or molecular criteria. Statistical analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with HZ and the relative risk (RR) of HZ episode occurring in those ≥ 12 months post HCT considering aRZV status and cumulative follow-up period.

Results

In total 445 patients were included. Median age was 56-years-old (interquartile range, IQR, 38–64), with slight male predominance (241/445, 54.2%). From ≥ 12 months post alloHCT, there were 43 HZ episodes, with 26/263 (9.9%) in patients who had received at least one dose of aRZV, 19/263 (7.2%) after two doses, 7/70 (10.0%) in those who had not received aRZV and 10/112 (8.9%) with unknown vaccination status. Median time to HZ post any dose of aRZV was 8.1 months (IQR 3.9–12.3). Overall, median time to HZ episode post alloHCT was 20.7 months (IQR 16.9–27.9), the majority occurring after antiviral prophylaxis cessation (38/43, 88.4%). Most HZ episodes were localized (38/43, 88.4%), treated in the outpatient setting with oral antiviral therapy (39/43, 90.7%) for a median of 10 days (IQR 7–14). There was no disseminated HZ in those who had received aRZV. Considering aRZV status and follow-up period, the RR of HZ in those who had received two doses of aRZV compared to those who had not received any doses of aRZV was 0.90 (95% Confidence Interval 0.75–1.07, p = 0.22). In a sensitivity analysis, the risk of HZ was reduced (lower RR) in those receiving aRZV ≥ 12 months post-HCT compared with those who did not receive aRZV.

Conclusions

Overall, the receipt of aRZV did not seem to influence the frequency of HZ in patients post alloHCT, however, there may be disease severity modification and benefit if receiving beyond 12 months post HCT. We provide preliminary findings that would benefit from further evaluation in a prospective, randomized trial.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^1169Nu7h]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Studies of Efficacy and Duration of Protection

One randomized, placebo-controlled trial has evaluated short-term efficacy of herpes zoster vaccine administered to adults aged 50 through 59 years. This study of 22,439 adults in this age group showed a vaccine efficacy of 69.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 54.1%–80.6%) for the prevention of herpes zoster over a mean follow up period of 1.3 years. Efficacy for prevention of PHN and long-term vaccine efficacy in this age group were not studied.

Two studies have evaluated the short-term efficacy of the zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 60 years. The shingles prevention study (SPS), a randomized controlled trial, followed 38,546 subjects for up to 4.9 years after vaccination (median = 3.1 years) and found a vaccine efficacy of 51.3% (CI = 44.2%–57.6%) for prevention of herpes zoster and 66.5% (CI = 47.5%–79.2%) for prevention of PHN. The short-term persistence substudy (STPS) followed a subset of 14,270 SPS subjects primarily 4 to 7 years after vaccination and found a vaccine efficacy of 39.6% (CI = 18.2%–55.5%) for prevention of herpes zoster and 60.1% (CI = −9.8%–86.7%) for prevention of PHN. The point estimates for vaccine efficacy for prevention of herpes zoster by year after vaccination from the combined SPS and STPS studies decreased from 62.0% (CI = 49.6%–71.6%) in the first year after vaccination to 43.1% (CI = 5.1%–66.5%) in year 5. The 95% CIs around the point estimates for years 6 (30.6%) and 7 (52.8%) included zero; therefore vaccine protection could not be demonstrated after year 5. Vaccine efficacy for prevention of PHN decreased from 83.4% (CI = 56.7%–95.0%) in year 1 to 69.8 (CI = 27.3%–89.1%) in year 2. Estimates for years 3 through 7 after vaccination were not statistically significantly different from zero, although point estimates were generally higher compared with estimates of vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster.

Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) — evidence on immunogenicity and safety in cancer: The adjuvanted, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 and is a nonlive, adjuvanted recombinant subunit (surface glycoprotein E) vaccine; two doses are immunogenic in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, with humoral responses tending to be higher when given before or after immunosuppressive therapy rather than during therapy. Adverse events were common: Grade 3 local adverse events, such as injection-site pain, were reported in 12%–13% of patients in vaccine arms and no one in placebo arms; Grade 3 solicited general adverse events were more common in vaccine than placebo arms (22% v 16% and 16% v 6%). As with COVID-19 vaccines, response to RZV was lower in patients treated with BTK inhibitors.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^1153TgqS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, also known as 'shingles', is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and it can significantly compromise the quality of life of affected individuals. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus for clinical use among older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine has also been tested. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This new vaccine is not yet available for clinical use.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1948 to the 3rd week of October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and LILACS (1982 to October 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also performed 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Main Results

We identified 13 studies involving 69,916 participants. The largest study included 38,546 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries and included only healthy Caucasian individuals ≥ 60 years of age without immunosuppressive comorbidities. Ten studies used live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccines. Three studies tested a new type of vaccine not yet available for clinical use. We judged five of the included studies to be at low risk of bias. The incidence of herpes zoster, at up to three years of follow-up, was lower in participants who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56, risk difference (RD) 2%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of mild to moderate intensity adverse events. These date came from one large study that included 38,546 people aged 60 years or older. A study including 8122 participants compared the new vaccine (not yet available) to the placebo; the group that received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years of follow-up: RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, RD 3%, NNTB 33; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events but most them were of mild to moderate intensity. All studies received funding from the pharmaceutical industry.

Authors' Conclusions

Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease and this protection can last three years. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are studies of a new vaccine (with a VZV glycoproteic fraction plus adjuvant), which is currently not yet available for clinical use.

### Effect of recombinant zoster vaccine on incidence of herpes zoster after autologous stem cell transplantation: a randomized clinical trial [^116Cp5UL]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Herpes zoster, a frequent complication following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is associated with significant morbidity. A nonlive adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine has been developed to prevent posttransplantation zoster.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse event profile of the recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised autologous HSCT recipients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded study conducted in 167 centers in 28 countries between July 13, 2012, and February 1, 2017, among 1846 patients aged 18 years or older who had undergone recent autologous HSCT.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive 2 doses of either recombinant zoster vaccine (n = 922) or placebo (n = 924) administered into the deltoid muscle; the first dose was given 50 to 70 days after transplantation and the second dose 1 to 2 months thereafter.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was occurrence of confirmed herpes zoster cases.

Results

Among 1846 autologous HSCT recipients (mean age, 55 years; 688 [37%] women) who received 1 vaccine or placebo dose, 1735 (94%) received a second dose and 1366 (74%) completed the study. During the 21-month median follow-up, at least 1 herpes zoster episode was confirmed in 49 vaccine and 135 placebo recipients (incidence, 30 and 94 per 1000 person-years, respectively), an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.22–0.44; P < .001), equivalent to 68.2% vaccine efficacy. Of 8 secondary end points, 3 showed significant reductions in incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (vaccine, n = 1; placebo, n = 9; IRR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.00–0.78; p = 0.02) and of other prespecified herpes zoster-related complications (vaccine, n = 3; placebo, n = 13; IRR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.04–0.81; p = 0.02) and in duration of severe worst herpes zoster-associated pain (vaccine, 892.0 days; placebo, 6275.0 days; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.89; p = 0.01). Five secondary objectives were descriptive. Injection site reactions were recorded in 86% of vaccine and 10% of placebo recipients, of which pain was the most common, occurring in 84% of vaccine recipients (grade 3: 11%). Unsolicited and serious adverse events, potentially immune-mediated diseases, and underlying disease relapses were similar between groups at all time points.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults who had undergone autologous HSCT, a 2-dose course of recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo significantly reduced the incidence of herpes zoster over a median follow-up of 21 months.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^116JXewM]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Zoster vaccination — routine schedule: Age 50 years of age or older should receive 2 doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) 2 to 6 months apart regardless of previous episodes of HZ or previous receipt of zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (administer RZV at least 2 months after ZVL). Immunocompromised adults 19 years of age or older should receive a 2-dose series of RZV 2 to 6 months apart. No screening for evidence of prior varicella infection is necessary. RZV should not be administered to patients experiencing an acute episode of HZ.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114wAMMj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in people with HIV is supported by limited data from a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 94 adults with HIV receiving ART with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm^3, 14 adults receiving ART with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm^3, and 15 ART-naive adults with CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/mm^3; the participants' median age was 46 years and participants received the vaccine in three doses administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, with increased humoral and cell-mediated immunity to VZV gE after two doses including among people with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm^3, common side effects of pain at the injection sites (98.6% of participants, 16.4% Grade 3), fatigue (75.3%, 16.4% Grade 3), myalgia (74.0%, 13.7% Grade 3), and headache (64.4%, 8.2% Grade 3), and no vaccine-related severe adverse events during follow-up; based on these very limited data, the vaccine appears safe and immunogenic and no efficacy data are available for the RZV among people with HIV. Given that the risk of herpes zoster is high among people with HIV, administration of RZV to people with HIV 18 years of age and older is recommended following the FDA-approved schedule for persons without HIV (intramuscular [IM] dose at 0 and 2–6 months) (AIII). No data identify the optimal timing of vaccination for persons who have a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm^3 or who are not suppressed virologically on ART; following initiation of ART, some experts would administer the RZV vaccination series after CD4 count recovery (CIII), and others would administer the series after virologic suppression was achieved (CIII). RZV is not a treatment of herpes zoster and should not be given during acute episodes (AIII), and it also should not be given to individuals with VZV-related inflammatory eye disease (keratitis or anterior uveitis) during episodes of active inflammation (AIII); a 1-dose attenuated live-zoster virus vaccine (zoster vaccine live [ZVL], Zostavax) was FDA approved for use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years, but as of November 18, 2020, it is no longer available for use in the United States and those who previously received ZVL should be revaccinated with RZV.

### Hypermetabolic axillary lymphadenopathy after shingrix vaccination for varicella zoster virus [^116AF1TA]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 67-year-old woman underwent staging 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan for recently diagnosed breast cancer. Her scan showed a highly hypermetabolic right breast mass, with ipsilateral hypermetabolic axillary lymph nodes. The contralateral axillary lymph nodes were also enlarged with avid FDG uptake, alongside focal increased uptake in the left deltoid muscle. Upon investigation, the patient reported receiving the new zoster recombinant adjuvanted varicella zoster vaccine (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline) 4 days before the scan. The lymph node uptake could be potential pitfall for cancer staging.

### Lipo-pam ™ adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine induces potent gE-specific cellular and humoral immune responses [^115P3RLq]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Decreased VZV-specific T-cell immune responses significantly contribute to the development of HZ. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine that is currently used to prevent HZ. However, Shingrix has high reactogenicity and pain at the injection site due to QS21, one of the adjuvant components. In this study, we developed a new herpes zoster vaccine formulation called CVI-VZV-001, containing gE protein and a novel liposome-based adjuvant Lipo-pam™, which consists of two TLR agonists. We evaluated the immunogenicity of CVI-VZV-001 in mouse and rabbit models. CVI-VZV-001 elicited robust gE-specific T-cell immune responses and gE-specific antibody production. Specifically, CVI-VZV-001 induced polyfunctional CD4 + T cell populations that secrete multiple cytokines. Furthermore, CVI-VZV-001 sustained the gE-specific immune responses for up to six months after immunization. To ensure CVI-VZV-001's safety for further development, we conducted a good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity test, which confirmed that CVI-VZV-001 is safe for use. At present, CVI-VZV-001 is undergoing phase I clinical trials. This study suggests that CVI-VZV-001 can be a potent candidate for the HZ vaccine with high immunogenicity and safety.

### Safety of zoster vaccine in elderly adults following documented herpes zoster [^115VPdR2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

After completion of the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS; Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Number 403), SPS participants who had initially received placebo were offered investigational zoster vaccine without charge. This provided an opportunity to determine the relative safety of zoster vaccine in older adults following documented herpes zoster (HZ).

Methods

A total of 13 681 SPS placebo recipients who elected to receive zoster vaccine were followed for serious adverse events (SAE) for 28 days after vaccination. In contrast to the SPS, a prior episode of HZ was not a contraindication to receiving zoster vaccine. The SPS placebo recipients who received zoster vaccine included 420 who had developed documented HZ during the SPS.

Results

The mean interval between the onset of HZ and the receipt of zoster vaccine in the 420 recipients with prior HZ was 3.61 years (median interval, 3.77 years [range, 3–85 months]); the interval was < 5 years for approximately 80% of recipients. The proportion of vaccinated SPS placebo recipients with prior HZ who developed ≥ 1 SAE (0.95%) was not significantly different from that of vaccinated SPS placebo recipients with no prior history of HZ (0.66%), and the distribution of SAEs in the 2 groups was comparable.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that the general safety of zoster vaccine in older persons is not altered by a recent history of documented HZ, supporting the safety aspect of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation to administer zoster vaccine to all persons ≥ 60 years of age with no contraindications, regardless of a prior history of HZ.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114JuiSH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

With FDA approval, Zostavax is available in the United States and indicated for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Vaccination providers considering the use of Zostavax among certain persons aged 50 through 59 years despite the absence of an ACIP recommendation should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their patients. Although the vaccine has short-term efficacy, there have been no long-term studies of vaccine protection in this age group. In adults vaccinated at age ≥ 60 years, vaccine efficacy wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and protection beyond 5 years is uncertain; therefore, adults receiving the vaccine before age 60 years might not be protected when their risks for herpes zoster and its complications are highest. CDC is actively monitoring postmarketing data on duration of vaccine protection in adults vaccinated at age ≥ 60 years. As additional data become available, ACIP will reevaluate the optimal age for vaccination and the need for revaccination to maintain protection against herpes zoster and its complications.

### Bullous fixed drug eruption following administration of the recombinant adjuvant shingrix vaccine [^114ZfJgV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 51-year-old woman with Crohn's disease presented with a bullous rash on her left arm and axilla 2days after receiving her second dose of the recombinant adjuvant Shingrix vaccine. PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1, HSV 2 and varicella zoster virus was negative. Punch biopsy revealed changes that were consistent with a bullous fixed drug eruption. She was successfully treated oral prednisone and topical triamcinolone cream. This is the first known case of a bullous fixed drug eruption due to the recombinant adjuvant Shingrix vaccine.

### Avoiding rash decisions about zoster vaccination: insights from cost-effectiveness evidence [^115cL1Ep]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The adjuvanted Shingrix® vaccine

Given the concerns regarding the ZVL, uptake was lower than expected. After 7 years on the market in the U.S. coverage with the ZVL in patients over 60 years was estimated at 19.5%. In this context, the approval of a newer zoster vaccine in 2017 was welcomed. Shingrix is an adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su) that overcomes many of the limitations of the ZVL. First, the HZ/su has significantly greater efficacy than the ZVL. In particular, among patients over 70 years the efficacy of the HZ/su has been estimated at 91% compared to 38% for the ZVL. Second, the HZ/su is not contraindicated in patients with immunocompromised states. Finally, the HZ/su is indicated in patients over the age of 50 (as opposed to 60 years for the ZVL).

While the HZ/su has significant advantages over the ZVL, it has three main limitations. Compared with placebo, those that received the HZ/su in clinical trials experienced a higher risk of adverse events, including grade 3 systemic reactions. These side effects are particularly concerning because they may discourage patients from obtaining the required booster injection within 2–6 months of the original vaccination. Of note, prior studies of vaccines that require a second shot indicate that adults frequently do not get the entire series. For example, only 43.6% and 61.1% of patients over 65 years receive the second hepatitis A and B immunizations, respectively, within 1 year of receiving the initial shots. The ZVL does not require a second injection; however, re-vaccination at 10 years has been studied to overcome its lack of efficacy over time. Additionally, it remains unknown whether the effectiveness of the HZ/su will decline as rapidly as does that of the ZVL, although it is expected that the immune response to the HZ/su will be better maintained owing to its superior initial antibody response. Finally, the HZ/su is costlier than the ZVL.

### Assessment of herpes zoster risk among recipients of COVID-19 vaccine [^114vaA1J]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The rapid production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines have been key measures in reducing the burden of disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As millions of US residents complete their COVID-19 primary immunization series and receive additional doses or booster injections to maintain adequate immunity, there remains a need for vaccine safety monitoring. Surveillance of vaccine safety in clinical practice is important after licensure when a vaccine is administered to large numbers of the general population, including subgroups such as immunocompromised individuals who were not included in initial clinical trials.

Due to the world-altering nature of COVID-19, postvaccination adverse events have been a focus of both scientific and public attention. Multiple centers in the US and abroad have published case reports of herpes zoster after the first and second doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by a reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus and manifests as a blistering dermatomal rash that can lead to long-term pain and reduced quality of life. It is unknown whether these case reports represent increased reporting of randomly occurring herpes zoster cases given the increased attention on the COVID-19 vaccine or a true increase in risk. Although these case reports could not definitively establish an association between COVID-19 vaccination and herpes zoster, many of the reports postulated that an association may exist. This ambiguity has generated uncertainty among physicians and concern among patients, contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Characterization of this risk is important to vaccine safety monitoring and to inform ongoing vaccination efforts. Therefore, we performed this claims-based study to assess whether there was an increased risk of herpes zoster after COVID-19 vaccination.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^114JvMqd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The USA Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus, live zoster vaccine (LZV), for clinical use amongst older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), has also been approved. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2016.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2019 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, January 2019), MEDLINE (1948 to January 2019), Embase (2010 to January 2019), CINAHL (1981 to January 2019), LILACS (1982 to January 2019), WHO ICTRP (on 31 January 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov (on 31 January 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 11 new studies involving 18,615 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 24 studies involving 88,531 participants. Only three studies assessed the incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan. Fifteen studies used LZV. Nine studies tested an RZV. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Most data for the primary outcome (incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-quality evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6) of mild to moderate intensity (moderate-quality evidence). These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or over. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-quality evidence). There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that there symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All of the other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV and RZV are effective in preventing herpes zoster disease for up to three years (the main studies did not follow participants for more than three years). To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.

### Vaccination practices in dialysis patients: a narrative review [^112q5h3q]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

In a period of turmoil concerning vaccination practices, there is a serious conflict between scientifically reasonable, evidence-based guidelines and the far-fetched rumors or misconceptions concerning the vaccination practices in the general population. When a significant portion of the medical and paramedical personnel may be deliberately unvaccinated against common biological agents, achieving effective vaccination rates in the dialysis population may be complicated. Vaccination rates are unacceptably low in dialysis patients and seroconversion rates are even lower; further, serological follow-up is generally poor. The particularly anergic immune system of the advanced chronic kidney disease patients is partly a cause of both high rates of infection and low rates of seroconversions. This narrative review is an effort to summarize current knowledge concerning the vaccination practices in dialysis patients with some specific recommendations based on these facts. Of particular interest is a new vaccine, the Zoster Recombinant, Adjuvanted Vaccine (Shingrix), which we will include in our discussion.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies: a phase 3, randomised, clinical trial and post-hoc efficacy analysis [^117P5SiN]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study, done at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1–2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments, and stratified participants according to their underlying diseases. The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after last vaccination in all participants; evaluation of the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; and evaluation of the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We assessed immunogenicity in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767467, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2012–003438–18.

Findings

Between March 1, 2013, and Sept 10, 2015, we randomly assigned 286 participants to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine and 283 to placebo. 283 in the vaccine group and 279 in the placebo group were vaccinated. At month 2, 119 (80·4%, 95% CI 73·1–86·5) of 148 participants had a humoral vaccine response to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, compared with one (0·8%, 0·0–4·2) of 130 participants in the placebo group, and the adjusted geometric mean anti-glycoprotein E antibody concentration was 23132·9 mIU/mL (95% CI 16642·8–32153·9) in the vaccine group and 777·6 mIU/mL (702·8–860·3) in the placebo group (adjusted geometric mean ratio 29·75, 21·09–41·96; p < 0·0001) in all patients, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted above baseline until month 13 in all strata and, as expected, vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo (within 7 days after vaccination pain was reported by 221 [79·5%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 45 [16·4%] of 274 placebo group participants; fatigue was reported by 162 [58·3%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 102 [37·2%] of 274 placebo group participants). Incidences of unsolicited or serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, disease-related events, and fatal serious adverse events were similar between the groups.

Interpretation

The immunocompromised adult population with haematological malignancies is at high risk for herpes zoster. The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, which is currently licensed in certain countries for adults aged 50 years and older, is likely to benefit this population.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116xrdkA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Varicella and zoster vaccination — adults and adolescents with HIV: Varicella vaccination (Varivax) should be considered as 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine administered 3 months apart for adults and adolescents with HIV with a CD4 count > 200 cells/μL on suppressive ART who do not have prior evidence of immunity to varicella and with a CD4 cell percentage ≥ 15%; persons without evidence of immunity at risk after exposure should receive varicella zoster IG within 10 days. Varicella zoster IG is not indicated for persons who received 2 doses of varicella vaccine and became immunocompromised later in life. RZV (Shingrix) should be administered to adults aged ≥ 18 years using 2 doses 2–6 months apart for prevention of herpes zoster; those with virus suppressed on ART with CD4 count > 200 cells/μL may respond better, but the vaccine can be safely given regardless of CD4 cell count, and those who have not had varicella exposure should not be offered this vaccine. Data indicate that 99% of those born prior to 1980 have had varicella, and studies in HIV have found the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic after 2 doses.

### Avoiding rash decisions about zoster vaccination: insights from cost-effectiveness evidence [^116NoC7D]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

de Boer and colleagues present a cost-effectiveness analysis based in the Netherlands of two vaccines available for the prevention of herpes zoster. Zostavax® was the first vaccine available for the prevention of herpes zoster in older adults. A live-attenuated vaccine, Zostavax is not free of limitations, which include a relatively low efficacy that wanes over time and its contraindication among immunocompromised individuals. The recently available adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine Shingrix® overcomes some of these limitations. The herpes zoster subunit vaccine is more efficacious than Zostavax, and it can be administered to immunosuppressed individuals. However, the herpes zoster subunit vaccine is considerably costlier and requires a booster injection. In order to clarify the value of each vaccine, de Boer and colleagues compare the cost-effectiveness of no vaccination, and of vaccination with Zostavax or the herpes zoster subunit vaccine in four cohorts of older adults from the perspective of the Netherlands. Whereas neither vaccine was cost-effective under the willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the authors find the herpes zoster subunit vaccine to be cost-effective in some scenarios under a €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine confers long-term protection against herpes zoster: interim results of an extension study of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 [^111JuEyv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Study Participants

Of the 14 648 ZOE-50/70 participants who received at least 1 RZV dose, 7413 (50.6%) were enrolled for the long-term efficacy assessment, exceeding the expected sample size. Of these, 7277 had previously received both RZV doses and were included in the mTVC for the efficacy assessments, 813 in the ATP cohort for humoral immunity persistence, and 108 in the ATP cohort for CMI persistence (Figure 2). In the mTVC, the mean age at first vaccination in the ZOE-50/70 studies was 67.2 (± 9.4) years (Table 1); 60.7% were women, and 76.5% of participants were of European ancestry. Demographic characteristics in the ATP cohorts for humoral and CMI persistence were similar to those in the mTVC (Table 1).

Table 1.
Summary of Demographic Characteristics

Long-Term Efficacy

During the period ranging from a mean of approximately 5.1 to approximately 7.1 years post-vaccination, 27 and 169 confirmed HZ cases occurred in the vaccine and control groups, respectively, and thus RZV was 84.0% (95% CI, 75.9–89.8) efficacious in preventing HZ (Table 2). Through the entire post-vaccination follow-up period, ranging from 1 month post-dose 2 to a mean of approximately 7.1 years post-vaccination, 59 and 651 confirmed HZ cases occurred in the vaccine and control groups, respectively, and thus efficacy of RZV against HZ was 90.9% (95% CI, 88.2–93.2). Annual vaccine efficacy estimates reached a plateau > 84% between Y4 and Y6 post-vaccination (Table 2).

### Shingrix: the new adjuvanted recombinant herpes zoster vaccine [^115sZVnF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su) for use in adult patients for the prevention of shingles.

Data Sources

A literature search through PubMed was conducted (June 2008 to October 2017) using the terms shingles vaccine and varicella zoster virus. References from retrieved articles and the prescribing information were also reviewed for any additional material.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Randomized controlled, multicenter trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HZ/su. Literature on the epidemiology and pathology of herpes zoster virus infections and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

HZ/su is a new adjuvanted recombinant vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults 50 years of age and older. HZ/su significantly reduced the risk of developing herpes zoster by more than 90% as compared with placebo and displayed a comparable adverse effect profile. The most common local adverse events were injection site pain, redness, and swelling, and the most common systemic adverse events were myalgia, fatigue, and headache. The ACIP recommends the routine use of HZ/su as the preferred vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults 50 years of age and older.

Conclusions

Based on published immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety data, as well as the recent recommendations by the ACIP, HZ/su should be included on both hospital and community pharmacy formularies and recommended to all immunocompetent patients older than 50 years to prevent herpes zoster.

### Shingles vaccination of U.S. adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years before recommendations for use of recombinant zoster vaccine [^112hFC36]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2006, zoster vaccine live was recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. In 2011, zoster vaccine live was approved for use but not recommended for adults aged 50–59 years. This study assessed zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years.

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 National Health Interview Surveys were analyzed in 2019 to estimate national zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years. State-specific zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years was assessed using 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data.

Results

Among adults aged 50–59 years, zoster vaccine live coverage was 5.7% in 2017, ranging from 4% to 6% during 2013–2017 (test for trend, p > 0.05). Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years ranged from 5.8% in Pennsylvania to 14.7% in South Dakota. By 2017, zoster vaccine live was received by 34.9% of adults aged ≥ 60 years, a significant increase from 24.2% in 2013. Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 60 years in 2017 ranged from 26.0% in Mississippi to 51.8% in Vermont. In 2017, major characteristics significantly associated with increased likelihood of zoster vaccine live vaccination among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years were older age, having 4 to 9 physician contacts in the past 12 months, and having a usual place for health care.

Conclusions

This study provides an assessment of zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years before the newly recommended recombinant zoster vaccine came into widespread use. Providers should routinely assess adults' vaccination status and strongly recommend or offer needed vaccines to their patients.

### Adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients [^116vXk8M]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematopoietic stem-cell (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are particularly at risk to develop herpes zoster and its complications. A recently approved nonlive, adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (aRZV) is a potential candidate to provide durable prevention of herpes zoster. This review summarizes current scientific evidence and expert recommendations for its use in these populations and offers practical clinical guidance.

Recent Findings

Recent clinical trials have shown aRZV to be well tolerated and efficacious in the prevention of herpes zoster, even in the elderly. Data are emerging that this vaccine might also be effective in immunocompromised individuals, such as SOT and HSCT recipients. Evidence is sparse regarding optimal timing of vaccination and durability of responses. However, several specialized societies have already established expert-based aRZV immunization recommendations for these vulnerable populations.

Summary

Practical considerations, safety concerns, and timing of vaccine administration vary from one immunocompromised subpopulation to another. Initial studies show that aRZV has a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile in SOT and HSCT recipients. However, data are sparse, particularly in allogeneic HSCT, and practical recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion. Additional research is needed to offer better insight on aRZV administration in immunocompromised patients.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115nSEXX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing herpes zoster (shingles) — HIV adults and adolescents: RZV (Shingrix) is preferred over attenuated ZVL (Zostavax) for prevention of herpes zoster (AIII). RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of CD4 count, with a schedule of RZV 0.5 mL IM injection (2 dose series) at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII), and RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine. If RZV is not available or cannot be given because of allergy or intolerance, ZVL can be administered (0.65 mL SQ for 1 dose) (BIII), but ZVL is contraindicated for persons with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (AIII).

### Recombinant zoster vaccine (shingrix): real-world effectiveness in the first 2 years post-licensure [^114LSHkv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine) was licensed to prevent herpes zoster, dispensed as 2 doses given 2–6 months apart among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Clinical trials yielded efficacy of > 90% for confirmed herpes zoster, but post-market performance has not been evaluated. Efficacy of a single dose and a delayed second dose and efficacy among persons with autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions have not been studied. We aimed to assess post-market vaccine effectiveness of Shingrix.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study among Medicare Part D community-dwelling beneficiaries aged > 65 years. Herpes zoster was identified using a medical office visit diagnosis with treatment, and postherpetic neuralgia was identified using a validated algorithm. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to improve cohort balance and marginal structural models to estimate hazard ratios.

Results

We found a vaccine effectiveness of 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.6–71.5) and 56.9% (95% CI, 55.0–58.8) for 2 and 1 doses, respectively. The 2-dose vaccine effectiveness was not significantly lower for beneficiaries aged > 80 years, for second doses received at ≥ 180 days, or for individuals with autoimmune conditions. The vaccine was also effective among individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness against postherpetic neuralgia was 76.0% (95% CI, 68.4–81.8).

Conclusions

This large real-world observational study of the effectiveness of Shingrix demonstrates the benefit of completing the 2-dose regimen. Second doses administered beyond the recommended 6 months did not impair effectiveness. Our effectiveness estimates were lower than the clinical trials estimates, likely due to differences in outcome specificity.

### Recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine and reduced risk of coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis and hospitalization in older adults [^112wgg6U]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Some vaccines elicit nonspecific immune responses that may protect against heterologous infections. We evaluated the association between recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (RZV) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.

Methods

In a cohort design, adults aged ≥ 50 years who received ≥ 1 RZV dose before 1 March 2020 were matched 1:2 to unvaccinated individuals and followed until 31 December 2020. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for COVID-19 outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. In a test-negative design, cases had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test and controls had only negative tests, during 1 March-31 December 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs for RZV receipt were estimated using logistic regression.

Results

In the cohort design, 149244 RZV recipients were matched to 298488 unvaccinated individuals. The aHRs for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were 0.84 (95% CI, .81-.87) and 0.68 (95% CI, .64-.74), respectively. In the test-negative design, 8.4% of 75726 test-positive cases and 13.1% of 340898 test-negative controls had received ≥ 1 RZV dose (aOR, 0.84 [95% CI, .81-.86]).

Conclusions

RZV vaccination was associated with a 16% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and 32% lower risk of hospitalization. Further study of vaccine-induced nonspecific immunity for potential attenuation of future pandemics is warranted.

### Shingles vaccine [^114jZCdt]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Herpes zoster or shingles is a condition with the potential to result in severe debilitation. It affects approximately 10–30% of the population. Until recently there were only treatments to shorten the duration and lessen the symptoms of herpes zoster, but no practical or approved method of prevention for susceptible immunocompetent adults. The live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck & Co, Inc.) is effective in preventing shingles in individuals 60 years of age and older and recommended by the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Areas Covered In This Review

Literature related to the live attenuated zoster vaccine is reviewed from its beginnings in the early 1970s through to the present.

What The Reader Will Gain

Background information on herpes zoster and up to date information on the live attenuated zoster vaccine including pharmacology, efficacy and safety are covered. New areas of research in zoster vaccination are also discussed.

Take Home Message

The live attenuated zoster vaccine is an effective and well-tolerated method of preventing zoster and the potentially debilitating sequelae and is recommended for immunocompetent patients 60 years of age and older. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating new means of effective prevention.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) — vaccinations: "AACE supports the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that all persons with DM receive age-appropriate vaccinations according to the CDC/ACIP schedule (7)", with specifics including: "Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for those with DM who are ≥ 6 mo old". For pneumococcal vaccination, "The 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15 or PCV20) should be administered to all adults aged 19 to 64 y who have DM. When PCV15 is used, PPSV23 should be administered at least 12 mo following the dose of PCV15. A minimum interval of 8 wk may be used for adults with immunocompromising conditions". For older adults, "For adults over 65 who have not previously received PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown, PCV15 or PCV20 should be administered. When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23". Hepatitis B guidance states, "It is recommended to administer hepatitis B vaccinations to all individuals as soon after diagnosis of DM as possible up to age 59 y", and "Consider hepatitis B vaccination of adults ≥ 60 y based on assessment of risk and likelihood of an adequate immune response". Tetanus boosters are addressed: "all adults with DM should receive a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster every 10 y". Regarding COVID-19, "persons with DM should be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to current guidelines". For shingles prevention, "Recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended for adults ≥ 50 y". The guideline also states, "Health care professionals should utilize interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates to improve uptake of vaccination among persons with DM".

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^116z2VrR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives and Assessments

Objectives

The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of anti-gE antibody responses in previous ZVL recipients as compared to ZVL-naïve study participants at 1mo post-dose 2 and the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of RZV in both groups through 1mo post-dose 2, and were disclosed elsewhere. Secondary objectives included the descriptive assessment of humoral and CMI responses through 12 months after dose 2, as well as the assessment of safety between 1 and 12 months after dose 2. The correlation between humoral and CMI responses and polyfunctional CD4 T cells were evaluated in post hoc analyses.

Assessment of Immunogenicity

Anti-gE antibody concentrations were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described elsewhere. The frequencies of gE-specific CD4 T cells expressing ≥ 2 activation markers (referred to as CD4 2+ T cells) and the frequencies of gE-specific CD4 T cells expressing each or various combinations of the assessed activation markers (including interferon [IFN] γ, interleukin 2 [IL-2], tumor necrosis factor α, and CD40 ligand [CD40L]) were determined as described elsewhere.

Assessment of Safety

Serious adverse events (SAEs) and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were recorded from the first RZV dose through 12 months after dose 2. The causal relationship to vaccination was assessed by the study investigator.

Suspected HZ cases, defined as a new rash characteristic of HZ diagnosed by the investigator, were collected throughout the study. HZ cases were confirmed by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by a HZ ascertainment committee in a blinded manner if the case could not be confirmed or excluded by PCR.

Recommendation set 28.5–28.11 — Vaccination in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM): It is recommended to administer hepatitis B vaccination to all individuals as soon after diagnosis of DM as possible up to age 59 years (Grade A; BEL 1), and consider hepatitis B vaccination of adults ≥ 60 years based on assessment of risk and likelihood of an adequate immune response (Grade C; BEL 4). Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is typically included with routine childhood vaccinations; however, all adults with DM should receive a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster every 10 years (Grade C; BEL 4). Health care professionals may consider recommending vaccines for the following diseases for persons with T2D based on individual needs — Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis [whooping cough]), measles/mumps/rubella, varicella (chicken pox), and polio — and persons traveling to other countries may require vaccines for endemic diseases (Grade C; BEL 4, expert opinion of task force). Due to the increased risk for serious complications of COVID-19, persons with DM should be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to current guidelines (Grade B; BEL 2). Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended for adults aged ≥ 50 years for protection against shingles according to the CDC/ACIP vaccination schedule (Grade A; BEL 1). Health care professionals should utilize interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates to improve uptake of vaccination among persons with DM (Grade B; BEL 2).

### The recombinant shingles vaccine is associated with lower risk of dementia [^116KDGfm]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

There is emerging evidence that the live herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine might protect against dementia. However, the existing data are limited and refer only to the live vaccine, which is now discontinued in the United States and many other countries in favor of a recombinant vaccine. Whether the recombinant shingles vaccine protects against dementia remains unknown. Here we used a natural experiment opportunity created by the rapid transition from the use of live to the use of recombinant vaccines to compare the risk of dementia between vaccine types. We show that the recombinant vaccine is associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the 6 years post-vaccination. Specifically, receiving the recombinant vaccine is associated with a 17% increase in diagnosis-free time, translating into 164 additional days lived without a diagnosis of dementia in those subsequently affected. The recombinant shingles vaccine was also associated with lower risks of dementia than were two other vaccines commonly used in older people: influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccines. The effect was robust across multiple secondary analyses, and was present in both men and women but was greater in women. These findings should stimulate studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning the protection and could facilitate the design of a large-scale randomized control trial to confirm the possible additional benefit of the recombinant shingles vaccine.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^117HbiwF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ) on reactivation. Immunosenescence leads to a decrease of VZV-specific T-cell responses, which are thought to be the main mechanistic protection against VZV reactivation. Advanced age is therefore one of the major risk factors for developing HZ, with incidences increasing from < 5/1000 person-years in individuals aged < 50 years to > 10/1000 person-years in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Vaccination represents a means to reduce HZ risk in older adults. In 2006, a live-attenuated HZ vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax; Merck Sharp & Dohme) was licensed and subsequently recommended in the United States for prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 60 years. However, its efficacy decreases with age. In addition, efficacy against HZ is statistically significant only through year 5 and becomes negligible by year 11. Tseng et al hypothesized that, owing to declining effectiveness over time, revaccination of previous ZVL recipients might be beneficial. However, ZVL-boosted cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses decline significantly in 3 years in reimmunized individuals, with only memory responses remaining marginally higher compared with de novo–immunized individuals.

Given on a 2-dose schedule, the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix; GSK), consisting of the VZV glycoprotein E (gE) antigen and the AS01 B adjuvant system, demonstrated > 90% efficacy against HZ across all age strata, sustained over 4 years of follow-up. Since 2017, RZV has received licensure for the prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 50 years in several countries. RZV induces robust humoral and CMI responses, which plateau as of about 4 years after vaccination and are predicted to remain above prevaccination levels for ≥ 15 years after vaccination.

Because the efficacy of ZVL wanes during the first 5 years after vaccination, and because ZVL was recommended in the United States for persons aged ≥ 60 years when our study was designed, we evaluated RZV in ≥ 65-year-olds who had received ZVL ≥ 5 years earlier. After demonstration of the study's primary objectives (ie, noninferior immune responses to RZV in previous ZVL recipients compared with ZVL-naive individuals and a similar safety profile between groups up to 1 month after dose 2), RZV was recommended in the United States to previous ZVL recipients.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine confers long-term protection against herpes zoster: interim results of an extension study of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 [^113PwWq1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This ongoing follow-up study evaluated the persistence of efficacy and immune responses for 6 additional years in adults vaccinated with the glycoprotein E (gE)-based adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) at age ≥ 50 years in 2 pivotal efficacy trials (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70). The present interim analysis was performed after ≥ 2 additional years of follow-up (between 5.1 and 7.1 years [mean] post-vaccination) and includes partial data for year (Y) 8 post-vaccination.

Methods

Annual assessments were performed for efficacy against herpes zoster (HZ) from Y6 post-vaccination and for anti-gE antibody concentrations and gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cell (expressing ≥ 2 of 4 assessed activation markers) frequencies from Y5 post-vaccination.

Results

Of 7413 participants enrolled for the long-term efficacy assessment, 7277 (mean age at vaccination, 67.2 years), 813, and 108 were included in the cohorts evaluating efficacy, humoral immune responses, and cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. Efficacy of RZV against HZ through this interim analysis was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.9–89.8) from the start of this follow-up study and 90.9% (95% CI, 88.2–93.2) from vaccination in ZOE-50/70. Annual vaccine efficacy estimates were > 84% for each year since vaccination and remained stable through this interim analysis. Anti-gE antibody geometric mean concentrations and median frequencies of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells reached a plateau at approximately 6-fold above pre-vaccination levels.

Conclusions

Efficacy against HZ and immune responses to RZV remained high, suggesting that the clinical benefit of RZV in older adults is sustained for at least 7 years post-vaccination. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT02723773.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2018 [^114tV59z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Changes in the 2018 Adult Immunization Schedule

Zoster Vaccination. On October 20, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of RZV (SHINGRIX, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) for adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its complications. On October 25, ACIP recommended the use of 1) RZV among immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications, 2) RZV among adults aged 50 years or older who previously received the zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (ZOSTAVAX, Merck and Co.), and 3) either RZV or ZVL for adults aged 60 years or older (RZV is preferred). On October 26, 2017, ACIP recommended the following in the 2018 adult immunization schedule:

Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults aged 50 years or older regardless of past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of ZVL.
Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults who previously received ZVL at least 2 months after ZVL.
For adults aged 60 years or older, administer either RZV or ZVL (RZV is preferred).

The clinical trials for RZV excluded pregnancy and confirmed or suspected immunocompromising conditions that can result from disease (e.g. malignancy, HIV infection) or therapy (e.g. cancer chemotherapy, treatment for autoimmune disorders). Therefore, no ACIP recommendation currently exists for use of RZV among pregnant women (health care providers should consider delaying administration of RZV for pregnant women) or adults with immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection (additional discussions and recommendations by ACIP on the use of RZV in adults with immunocompromising conditions are pending).

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^111sYiKr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The main limitation of these results is that intervals of < 5 years between a previous ZVL dose and 2 subsequent RZV doses have not been evaluated. However, there are no scientific data or theoretical concerns to indicate that RZV would be less safe or effective when administered with an interval of < 5 years. Accordingly, in older individuals (aged ≥ 50 years), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends administration of RZV at a shorter interval, but no sooner than 8 weeks after ZVL.

In conclusion, RZV induced strong humoral and polyfunctional CMI responses that persisted above prevaccination levels up to 1 year after RZV dose 2 in adults aged ≥ 65 years, irrespective of previous ZVL vaccination, without clinically significant differences in the RZV safety profile between study groups. Therefore, both ZVL-naive individuals and previous ZVL recipients are likely to similarly benefit from RZV vaccination.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^114PfgxT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In adults aged ≥ 65 years, 2 RZV doses administered 2 months apart induced strong and persistent humoral and CMI responses, irrespective of ZVL vaccination status. Occurrences of SAEs and pIMDs after RZV were similar between previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive study participants.

Our end-of-study data show that both anti-gE antibody and gE-specific CD4 T-cell responses persist through 12 months after RZV dose 2, with no apparent differences between previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive participants. These findings indicate that persistence of immune responses to RZV, currently demonstrated for ≥ 10 years after vaccination, may also be expected in previous ZVL recipients.

Anti-gE antibody GMCs were similar between previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive study participants at all time points, including before vaccination. Although the humoral response to ZVL is dominated by anti-gE antibodies, this similarity may be explained by the rapid waning of ZVL-induced humoral immunity. When measured by glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, VZV-specific antibody titers 12 months after ZVL administration were indeed similar to prevaccination titers. Even though the results are not directly shown for anti-gE antibodies, one can assume that these follow the same trend and have decreased to pre-ZVL administration levels in the previous ZVL recipients in our study.

Immunization for herpes zoster (HZ) aims to reverse the decline in cell-mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus that occurs with advancing age or immunocompromise. There are 2 vaccines available, one live attenuated (Zoster vaccine, live attenuated [ZVL]) and, recently, a recombinant subunit vaccine (HZ/su).

Methods

The literature relevant to the two HZ vaccines was reviewed.

Results

ZVL has overall efficacies of 51% and 65% against HZ and postherpetic neuralgia, respectively, with a prominent decline in efficacy with advancing age of the vaccinee. This compares to approximately 90% efficacy against HZ for HZ/su that is minimally affected with advancing age. The efficacy of ZVL against HZ declines over 4 and 8 years, compared with minimal decline so far over 4 years with HZ/su, and immunogenicity that is maintained for 9 years. Local and systemic reactogenicity to HZ/su is much greater than to ZVL.

Conclusions

HZ/su establishes an important principle-that a single recombinant viral protein with an effective adjuvant combination can stimulate immunogenicity superior to that of a live attenuated vaccine, and that this can diminish immunosenescence. This provides hope for improvement of other vaccines for aging patients. However, key questions remain unanswered, including the durability of the efficacy of HZ/su, its efficacy as a booster for previous recipients of ZVL, and its efficacy in immunocompromised patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115PgcDV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus prevention in adults with HIV — recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV): Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) is the only available vaccine for prevention of shingles in the United States, and attenuated zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax) is no longer available for use in the United States. RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 18 years, regardless of CD4 count, as RZV 0.5 mL IM injection — 2-dose series at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII). RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are suppressed virologically on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine.

### Vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^113KRPZV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster disease and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia, are associated with significant morbidity in the elderly. The zoster vaccine boosts cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes both varicella and herpes zoster. This vaccine has demonstrated the ability to reduce the zoster-related burden of illness and the incidence of both zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in a randomized, controlled trial conducted in individuals aged 60 years and older, an age group at increased risk of herpes zoster. Widespread use of this vaccine could prevent as many as a quarter of a million cases of zoster disease each year. The design and outcomes of the Shingles Prevention Study, which examined the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and the rationale for widespread immunization against varicella-zoster virus, are presented here.

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^116gVDoV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in adults with cancer — "RZV should be made available to all adults with cancer", with optimal responses when it is "administered immediately after a cancer diagnosis and before the initiation of immunosuppressive treatments", and "The interval between the two RZV doses can be reduced to 4 weeks to achieve early protection". The RZV "has not been studied in patients with cancer who do not have a history of primary varicella (chickenpox)", but "Patients who have experienced herpes zoster should receive the vaccine to prevent future episodes", with "no specific waiting period before immunization, as long as the acute episode has resolved". Individuals previously given live zoster vaccine "are eligible to be immunized with the RZV", and "vaccination should not influence the duration of antiviral prophylaxis with certain therapies (eg, proteasome inhibitors)".

### Transient increased risk of shingles post shingrix vaccination: self-controlled case series analysis [^116hm8zk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Following the introduction of a funded recombinant shingles (RZV, Shingrix®) vaccination program in ≥ 65 years in Australia, clinician reports of shingles presentations shortly after vaccination emerged. We investigated whether there was an increase in shingles risk immediately post RZV vaccination in South-eastern Australia.

Methods

Two independent datasets- a general practice dataset and a statewide linked dataset- were analysed separately using self-controlled case series analyses (SCCS) with 21-days post-vaccination as the risk window. The observation period was 1 January 2023 to 30 April 2025. Adults ≥ 18 years old were included, with analyses stratified by age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) and sex. We calculated the rate of incident shingles in time periods relative to vaccination, along with attributable risk and the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Results

The primary care SCCS analysis found an 11-fold increase (Risk Incidence [RI] 10·96, 95% CI 10.34, 11.62, p < 0·0001) in shingles presentations within 21 days post-dose 1 of RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 in the general practice dataset only. No increase was detected in younger adults. Following dose two the risk of shingles presentations was reduced in all age groups. Vaccine recipients had an 73% reduction in shingles following 2 doses. PHN risk was not increased.

Conclusions

There is a transient increase in shingles presentations shortly after dose one of RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 years of age; however, these cases are likely to be mild and there is clear evidence of vaccine effectiveness after the completion of two doses.

### Adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine decreases herpes zoster-associated pain and the use of pain medication across 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^114MgTMu]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

This analysis, based on data from 3 large clinical efficacy trials, indicates that RZV can be beneficial in attenuating symptoms of breakthrough cases, both in older adults and in HSCT recipients. The results presented here suggest that RZV-vaccinated participants who developed HZ experienced shorter pain duration and required less pain relief than participants who received placebo and developed HZ. Owing to the high efficacy of RZV, the number of breakthrough cases is low; however, for patients experiencing such episodes, particularly those at risk for HZ, RZV has the potential to attenuate severity and duration of the disease, thereby maintaining QoL.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^116BB9NS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, immunocompromised adults, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to administer the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine typically 2–6 months after the first dose. Consider administering the second dose 1–2 months after the first dose in persons being or going to be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule. Repeat a valid second dose at least 4 weeks after the previous dose if the second recombinant zoster vaccine dose is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first. Do not restart the vaccine series if > 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

### Cost effectiveness of a shingles vaccine booster for currently vaccinated adults in the U.S [^111sAwtX]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a single dose of the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in people aged ≥ 60 years. Because vaccine-induced protection decreases to zero after 10 years, many vaccinated people will soon be subject to an increased risk of the disease. The study objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of a herpes zoster vaccine booster and its optimal timing among immunocompetent adults first vaccinated at aged ≥ 60 years.

Methods

A Markov model was built to follow vaccinated individuals for a lifetime. From the societal perspective, costs and quality-adjusted life years were compared between no booster versus booster options. A booster was given any time between 1 and 20 years after the first dose, and for those who had the first dose at different ages: 60, 70, and 80 years. Because people entered the model already vaccinated, costs and side effects of the first dose were not included. The booster was assumed to have the same efficacy and waning rate as the initial vaccination. Model inputs were based on published literature. A cost effectiveness threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used. The analysis was conducted in 2016.

Results

Cost effectiveness of a booster varied by age and time since vaccination. The booster cost < $100,000/quality-adjusted life year if given > 5 years after the initial dose, but was most cost effective at around 10 years. The finding was robust to wide variations in model inputs.

Conclusions

Under current assumptions, a booster dose of herpes zoster vaccine would be cost effective for all vaccinated people 10 years after initial vaccination.

The VE of RZV in reducing the use of pain medication for confirmed cases of HZ was assessed using an asymptotic standardized unconditional binomial test. The numbers of HZ-associated pain medications used and the duration of their use were also computed as means (ranges), whereby means were calculated as the arithmetic means and ranges as the differences between the maximum and the minimum values for a given participant group.

Clinical Guidance §§§§

Dosing schedule. Two RZV doses are necessary, regardless of previous history of herpes zoster or previous receipt of zoster vaccine live. The second RZV dose should typically be given 2–6 months after the first; for persons who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule, the second dose can be administered 1–2 months after the first. If the second RZV dose is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first, a valid second dose should be repeated at least 4 weeks after the dose given too early. The vaccine series does not need to be restarted if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

Timing of vaccination. When possible, patients should be vaccinated before becoming immunosuppressed. Otherwise, providers should consider timing vaccination when the immune response is likely to be most robust (i.e. during periods of lower immunosuppression and stable disease). RZV may be administered to patients who previously received varicella vaccine. RZV is not a live virus vaccine; therefore, RZV may be administered while patients are taking antiviral medications.

Coadministration with other vaccines. Recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Concomitant administration of RZV with other adult vaccines has been studied, and there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to either vaccine or of safety concerns. Coadministration of RZV with adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluad) and COVID-19 vaccines is being studied.

Counseling for reactogenicity. Before vaccination, providers should counsel patients about expected local and systemic reactogenicity, including grade 3 reactions. It is generally not recommended to take antipyretic or analgesic medications prophylactically before vaccination; however, antipyretic or analgesic medications may be taken for the treatment of postvaccination local or systemic symptoms. Patients should be encouraged to complete the series even if they experienced a (nonanaphylactic) grade 1–3 reaction after receipt of the first RZV dose.
