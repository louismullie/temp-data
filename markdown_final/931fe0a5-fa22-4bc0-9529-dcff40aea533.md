## Question

Can vitamin d deficiency cause hypocalcemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin D deficiency can cause hypocalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should review the physiology of vitamin D–mediated calcium absorption and the compensatory role of parathyroid hormone. Next, I will examine when compensation fails and identify clinical thresholds for hypocalcemia. After that, I should appraise direct clinical evidence and characteristic presentations, consider modifiers like drugs, kidney disease, and pregnancy, and clarify optimal laboratory evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and practical implications for testing and prevention.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I do not misclassify the severity. Vitamin D deficiency is typically defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] below 20 ng/mL, with severe deficiency often considered below 10 ng/mL, which helps frame risk for calcium abnormalities and rickets or osteomalacia [^114tvLJq]. I should also define hypocalcemia carefully; clinically, corrected total calcium less than about 8 mg/dL or ionized calcium under about 1.0 mmol/L is commonly used in practice and in pediatric series of hypocalcemic admissions associated with profound vitamin D deficiency, which will be relevant when I interpret the data that follows [^1127XE1Y] [^114RV8B2].

> Now, I need to check the physiological mechanism linking vitamin D to serum calcium. The active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, enhances intestinal calcium absorption; when vitamin D stores are low, intestinal calcium absorption declines, reducing the calcium flux from the gut and tending to lower serum calcium unless other mechanisms compensate, which provides a direct, biologically plausible route to hypocalcemia in deficiency [^1173WYpp] [^1165kh6X]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the body's homeostatic systems may buffer moderate deficits, so the degree of deficiency and the integrity of counter-regulation will determine whether hypocalcemia appears [^1165kh6X].

> I will now examine the compensatory response, because that is often what masks hypocalcemia in milder deficiency. When calcium begins to fall, parathyroid hormone (PTH) rises, increasing renal calcium reabsorption, stimulating 1-α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2D, and mobilizing skeletal calcium, frequently maintaining normal serum calcium despite low 25(OH)D, a phenomenon well described as secondary hyperparathyroidism in vitamin D deficiency [^1165kh6X]. Wait, let me verify the clinical signal for this threshold effect; observational data show that many individuals with 25(OH)D below 25 nmol/L still have calcium within reference range because of elevated PTH, underscoring that compensation is robust until it is overwhelmed [^116jhUiT].

> Next, I should review when compensation fails and hypocalcemia becomes overt. The critical point appears with severe deficiency; biochemical hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase emerge when 25(OH)D falls below about 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL), indicating the limits of PTH-mediated compensation and the transition to clinically significant derangements in calcium–phosphate homeostasis [^1165kh6X]. Let me reconsider whether pediatric data align; in large pediatric datasets, severe deficiency below 25 nmol/L is tightly linked with hypocalcemic presentations, including seizures, reinforcing this threshold concept in rapidly growing children where demands are high [^114RV8B2].

> I should double-check direct clinical evidence tying deficiency to hypocalcemia across settings. The Endocrine Society guideline explicitly associates vitamin D deficiency with decreased serum calcium, which supports causality at the guideline level [^114tvLJq]. A pediatric inpatient cohort with 25(OH)D less than 10 ng/mL reported life-threatening presentations, including seizures and arrhythmias from hypocalcemia; wait, the reported mean calcium of 6.0 mmol/L cannot be correct physiologically, so let me verify the units — this almost certainly reflects approximately 6.0 mg/dL rather than 6.0 mmol/L, which is consistent with severe hypocalcemia and the ionized calcium means reported, so the causal link remains intact after correcting the likely unit error [^114RV8B2]. Mechanistically, case-based evidence shows that profound deficiency can impair intestinal calcium absorption even in the presence of normal calcitriol levels, leading to symptomatic hypocalcemia that reverses with cholecalciferol repletion, which strengthens the biological argument beyond association [^111Usgeu]. Finally, diagnostic guidance enumerates vitamin D deficiency as an established cause of hypocalcemia within broader differential frameworks, consolidating this link in clinical practice algorithms [^1127XE1Y].

> Let me think about how deficiency-related hypocalcemia presents and who is most at risk, because that influences pretest probability. Clinically, neuromuscular irritability, tetany, seizures, and in severe pediatric cases cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia occur when calcium falls, while chronic deficiency manifests in rickets among children and osteomalacia in adults alongside elevated alkaline phosphatase and bone pain, reflecting impaired mineralization [^114RV8B2] [^1165kh6X]. I need to ensure I consider vulnerability groups; infants and toddlers, older adults with limited sun exposure, individuals with darker skin, postsurgical thyroid or parathyroid patients, those with chronic kidney disease, and patients on medications that deplete or antagonize vitamin D are overrepresented among those with deficiency-related hypocalcemia, which should lower the threshold to test 25(OH)D in these settings [^1143e3eh] [^1171vRao] [^114RV8B2] [^115VS7jc] [^113vE7rs] [^1127XE1Y].

> But wait, what if other modifiers tip compensated deficiency into overt hypocalcemia; I should review iatrogenic and physiological stressors. Antiresorptives like bisphosphonates and denosumab can precipitate or worsen hypocalcemia in the context of vitamin D deficiency, so labels and oncology guidelines emphasize screening and repletion of vitamin D and calcium before therapy and monitoring afterward, which is crucial given documented severe and sometimes prolonged hypocalcemia with denosumab when deficiency is uncorrected [^117P7Xcu] [^115ZQPwk] [^111pZT4t]. In pregnancy, maternal deficiency translates to low neonatal 25(OH)D, increasing neonatal hypocalcemia risk, and maternal hypocalcemia itself can have fetal skeletal consequences; meta-analytic and guideline data support the maternal–neonatal link, underscoring the need to maintain maternal sufficiency [^113sKttb] [^114Zqtw3]. Hold on, I should verify best testing practice; 25(OH)D is the appropriate status marker in hypocalcemia workups, whereas routine measurement of 1,25(OH)2D is not recommended for deficiency assessment, preventing misinterpretation of normal calcitriol in profound deficiency [^111vVZHD] [^114tvLJq].

> I should confirm that not all deficiency causes hypocalcemia, to avoid overcalling causation in mild cases. Most patients with mild to moderate deficiency maintain normocalcemia through secondary hyperparathyroidism, so overt hypocalcemia is more typical of severe deficiency, of deficiency plus impaired PTH reserve or action, or of deficiency plus additional stressors like antiresorptives or acute illness, which reconciles variable calcium findings across populations [^1165kh6X] [^116xm7rw]. Hmm, wait a minute, that means a normal calcium level does not exclude clinically meaningful deficiency, and conversely, unexplained hypocalcemia should prompt a careful search for deficiency even when PTH does not rise robustly, as PTH responses can be blunted in some individuals, including the elderly and certain neonates, which the observational literature highlights [^116xm7rw] [^1171vRao].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, vitamin D deficiency can cause hypocalcemia, primarily when deficiency is severe or when compensatory mechanisms are compromised, with a clear physiological mechanism via impaired intestinal calcium absorption, reproducible thresholds for decompensation around 25(OH)D below 25 nmol/L, and clinical data documenting symptomatic hypocalcemia reversed by vitamin D repletion across pediatric and adult contexts [^1173WYpp] [^1165kh6X] [^116xm7rw] [^114RV8B2] [^111Usgeu] [^1127XE1Y]. Hold on, I should verify we are not overstating; in milder deficiency, normocalcemia is common due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, so clinical context and severity grading of deficiency are key to attributing causality in a given patient [^1165kh6X] [^116xm7rw].

> Practical implications: I need to ensure that any patient with hypocalcemia has 25(OH)D measured and corrected if low, using cholecalciferol regimens with follow-up calcium monitoring, and to prevent iatrogenic hypocalcemia by repleting vitamin D and ensuring adequate calcium before initiating antiresorptives such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, with post-dose monitoring in high-risk groups [^114tvLJq] [^117P7Xcu] [^115ZQPwk]. For prevention, I should confirm age-appropriate intakes, with at least 400 IU/day for infants and at least 600 IU/day for children and adults, recognizing that higher daily intakes are often needed to achieve serum 25(OH)D targets and that 25(OH)D is the correct test for status monitoring in deficiency management [^111mfiHt] [^1143e3eh] [^114Hfpqn] [^111vVZHD].

In brief, vitamin D deficiency can cause hypocalcemia by **reducing intestinal calcium absorption** [^114tvLJq] [^1173WYpp] and triggering **secondary hyperparathyroidism** [^1165kh6X], which increases bone resorption and renal calcium loss. Hypocalcemia typically occurs when 25(OH)D **falls below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL)**, with risk rising as levels decline [^1165kh6X] [^116xm7rw]. Clinical features include neuromuscular irritability, tetany, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias, and **correction of vitamin D deficiency is essential to restore calcium homeostasis** [^1127XE1Y] [^114RV8B2] [^114tvLJq] [^111pZT4t].

## Physiological role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis

Vitamin D **maintains calcium homeostasis** through three mechanisms:

- **Intestinal absorption**: Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption, maintaining serum calcium levels [^1173WYpp].

- **Bone resorption**: Vitamin D stimulates osteoclasts to release calcium from bone when needed.

- **Renal reabsorption**: Vitamin D promotes renal calcium reabsorption, reducing urinary calcium loss [^113goT4d].

---

## Mechanism of hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency

Vitamin D deficiency **reduces intestinal calcium absorption** [^114tvLJq], lowering serum calcium and triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevated PTH increases bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption [^113goT4d]; with prolonged deficiency, bone calcium stores become depleted, leading to **persistent hypocalcemia** [^1173WYpp].

---

## Clinical evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to hypocalcemia

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm that **vitamin D deficiency causes hypocalcemia** [^1127XE1Y]. The Endocrine Society recognizes vitamin D deficiency as a cause of hypocalcemia [^114tvLJq]. Severe deficiency can cause life-threatening pediatric hypocalcemia with seizures and cardiac arrhythmias [^114RV8B2], and deficiency is a significant cause of neonatal hypocalcemia [^114Zqtw3].

---

## Threshold levels of vitamin D associated with hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia risk increases as 25(OH)D declines, with a **critical threshold around 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL)**:

| **Vitamin d status** | **25(OH)d level** | **Hypocalcemia risk** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe deficiency | < 25 nmol/L (< 10 ng/mL) | High [^1165kh6X] |
| Moderate deficiency | 25–50 nmol/L (10–20 ng/mL) | Moderate |
| Sufficiency | > 50 nmol/L (> 20 ng/mL) | Low |

---

## Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia due to vitamin D deficiency

Hypocalcemia from vitamin D deficiency presents with:

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Tetany, muscle cramps, paresthesia, seizures [^1127XE1Y].

- **Cardiac symptoms**: Arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval [^114RV8B2].

- **Skeletal symptoms**: Bone pain, osteomalacia, rickets [^1173WYpp].

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain groups are at **higher risk** of hypocalcemia from vitamin D deficiency:

- **Infants and children**: Rapid growth increases calcium needs [^114RV8B2].

- **Elderly individuals**: Reduced skin synthesis and dietary intake [^114Hfpqn].

- **Individuals with limited sun exposure**: Dark skin, cultural clothing, indoor lifestyle [^114tvLJq].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Impaired vitamin D activation [^113goT4d].

---

## Correction of vitamin D deficiency and calcium homeostasis

Correcting vitamin D deficiency **restores calcium homeostasis** by increasing intestinal absorption, reducing secondary hyperparathyroidism, and normalizing serum calcium [^114tvLJq] [^111pZT4t]. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium is **effective in preventing and treating hypocalcemia** [^112taDcv].

---

## Clinical guidelines for management

Clinical guidelines **recommend correcting vitamin D deficiency** to restore calcium homeostasis [^114tvLJq] [^111pZT4t] and using calcium supplementation with vitamin D to prevent hypocalcemia [^112taDcv]. They also advise **regular monitoring** of serum calcium and vitamin D levels during treatment [^113YzgpM].

---

Vitamin D deficiency is a **well-established cause of hypocalcemia**, primarily by reducing intestinal calcium absorption and inducing secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1127XE1Y]. Hypocalcemia risk rises as 25(OH)D falls below 25 nmol/L [^1165kh6X], and correcting deficiency with vitamin D and calcium supplementation effectively restores calcium homeostasis [^112taDcv].

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1165kh6X]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Figure 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D, enhancing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium levels.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe long-standing vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This deficit is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, which leads to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism contribute to bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency is estimated at 5% to 10%.

Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, the baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low, namely less than 25 nmol/L, as was the calcium intake.

### Calcium and phosphate disorders: Core curriculum 2024 [^113goT4d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Maintaining normal calcium and phosphate homeostasis is essential for optimal cellular, metabolic, and organ function. Parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis via multiple interlinked feedback loops, receptors, ion channels, and transporters. Following an initial overview of the stimuli and effects of the different hormonal regulators, this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology reviews the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate disorders through the lens of a series of illustrative cases.

The cases span clinical conundrums commonly encountered by nephrologists in their daily clinical practice and other less common disorders. Some of the cases present in the outpatient clinic setting and others in the inpatient hospital setting. Patients with normal kidney function, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and acute kidney injury are all represented. Some of the disorders are iatrogenic, and some are due to native disease. All demonstrate key aspects of pathophysiology that are essential knowledge for nephrology clinicians of all career stages.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114tvLJq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency can be associated with various conditions including malabsorption, increased serum PTH, and the effects of bariatric surgery. It can also be linked to corticosteroid use, bone pain, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rickets, and osteopenia. Symptoms such as myalgia, history of fractures, bowed legs, and muscle weakness are common. Additionally, decreased serum calcium, hip pain, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, osteoporosis, and decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D are indicators. Risk factors include chronic kidney disease (CKD), anticonvulsant use, limited sun exposure, and having a darker skin color.

### Characteristics of vitamin D deficiency hypocalcemia inpatient admissions at a single tertiary center [^114RV8B2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Severe 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency can result in life-threatening presentations due to hypocalcemia leading to seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of hypocalcemia and rickets in children; however, there are no recent studies on the burden of inpatient admissions in the United States. Our study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors of inpatient admissions due to severe hypocalcemia and 25(OH)D deficiency at a freestanding academic children's hospital.

A descriptive retrospective chart review was completed on all inpatient admissions from 2016 to 2021 for children aged 0–18 years with corrected calcium < 8 mg/dL and 25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL during admission.

Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (74% Black/African American). Neurological signs were described in 49%, bone abnormalities in 17%, and EKG abnormalities in 42% of the patients. The mean calcium serum level was 6.0 mmol/L (range 5.0–7.9 mmol/L), and the mean iCa was 0.77 mmol/L (range 0.54–0.99 mmol/L). The mean level of 25(OH)D was 5.5 ng/mL (range 2.1–9.7 ng/mL). The median length of stay was 4.5 days (range 1–59 days).

In this retrospective observational study, the risk factors identified include: (1) Black/African American race, (2) age less than two years, (3) lack of supplementation of vitamin D, and (4) dietary restrictions. Inpatient admissions are preventable through the implementation of education at both community and healthcare levels.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

In the UK, managing vitamin D deficiency in adult patients at risk of developing bone disease has led to controversy and confusion. We therefore welcome the authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on managing vitamin D deficiency. This guideline is designed to assist clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dietitians, and other practicing healthcare providers, by offering key recommendations on the following areas:

- **Best way of estimating vitamin D status**: Recommendations for correctly assessing vitamin D levels.
- **Recommendations for vitamin D testing**: Guidelines on when and how to test for vitamin D deficiency.
- **Threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency**: Establishing specific criteria for defining vitamin D deficiency.
- **Treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency**: Suggested treatments for addressing vitamin D deficiency effectively.
- **Guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency**: Protocols for the urgent rectification of severe deficiencies.
- **Guidance on maintenance therapy**: Instructions for ongoing vitamin D maintenance post-correction.
- **Guidance on monitoring blood tests**: Recommendations for the regular monitoring of blood levels to ensure effective management.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a significant health concern, accompanied by a plethora of conflicting guidelines and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. This authoritative guidance is a welcome development, which can significantly improve patient care and management.

- **Key points**:

- The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high worldwide, particularly among the elderly.
- 25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status, with levels defined as 25OHD < 30 nmol/L indicating deficiency.
- The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but it has been recently associated with other conditions.
- Vitamin D deficiency is linked with muscle weakness, predominantly affecting the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.

### A patient with extensive cerebral calcification due to pseudohypoparathyroidism: a case report [^113c7Yye]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Differential diagnoses in this patient, who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia, were hypoparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism due to long-standing vitamin D deficiency, PTH resistance due to magnesium deficiency, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. An elevated serum intact PTH level narrowed down the differentials to the latter three diagnoses. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was considered unlikely in the absence of conditions leading to longstanding vitamin D deficiency, such as chronic kidney disease, gastric or intestinal surgery, and chronic diarrhea suggestive of Crohn's disease or celiac disease.

Severe hypocalcemia and a high PTH level couldn't be explained solely by a marginally low (insufficient) vitamin D level. Although severe hypomagnesemia is well known to cause hypocalcemia through a combination of defective PTH secretion and some degree of PTH resistance, mild hypomagnesemia is unlikely to cause isolated PTH resistance leading to such severe hypocalcemia. Additionally, cerebral calcification can't be explained by hypomagnesemia alone. The presence of severe hypocalcemia and elevated PTH with a marginally low vitamin D level and especially the basal, thalamic, and dentate ganglia calcification suggests the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Although PHP presenting at 59 years of age is uncommon, there have been previous reports of adults presenting with symptomatic hypocalcemia due to PHP.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase is thought to be due to the development of osteomalacia secondary to reduced conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form i.e. 1,25.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111vVZHD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D measurement, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend measuring serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels only for monitoring certain conditions, such as acquired and inherited disorders of vitamin D and phosphate metabolism.

### Relationship between vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone in Cape Town [^116xm7rw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with abnormal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Methods**: Vitamin D requests at a tertiary hospital in South Africa over 2 years were retrospectively analyzed along with calcium and PTH levels.

- **Results**: Only when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level dropped below 25 nmol/L was there a significant rise in PTH. A subnormal 25(OH)D level was also not always related to hypocalcemia, as more than half of patients with their 25(OH)D level below 25 nmol/L had calcium levels in the reference range. However, all patients with calcium levels below 1.8 mmol/L were shown to have vitamin D insufficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Hypovitaminosis D may co-exist with a blunted PTH response. Therefore, assumptions about vitamin D status should not be made based on PTH and calcium values. 25(OH)D measurements should be requested when vitamin D deficiency is clinically suspected, irrespective of biochemical results.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^1173WYpp]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The etiology of endemic rickets was discovered a century ago. Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient elderly subjects.

VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects. These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, reproduction, and vascular and metabolic properties. From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define vitamin D's role.

### Hypovitaminosis D and 'functional hypoparathyroidism'-the NoNoF (Nottingham Neck of Femur) study [^1171vRao]. Age and Ageing (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D deficiency are common in elderly people and lead to increased bone loss, with an enhanced risk of osteoporotic fractures. Although hip fractures are a serious consequence, few therapeutic measures are given for primary or secondary prevention. A combination of calcium and vitamin D may not be the most effective treatment for all patients.

- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of hypovitaminosis D on the calcium-parathyroid hormone endocrine axis, bone mineral density and fracture type, and the optimal role of combination calcium and vitamin D therapy after hip fracture in elderly patients.

- **Design**: A population-based, prospective cohort study.

- **Methods**: 150 elderly subjects were recruited from the fast-track orthogeriatric rehabilitation ward within 7 days of surgery for hip fracture. This ward accepts people who live at home and are independent in activities of daily living. All subjects had a baseline medical examination, biochemical tests (parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), and were referred for bone densitometry.

- **Results**: At 68%, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 30 nmol/l) was high. However, only half the patients had evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, with the rest having a low to normal level of parathyroid hormone ('functional hypoparathyroidism'). Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypovitaminosis D had a higher mean corrected calcium, higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, lower hip bone mineral density, and an excess of extracapsular over intracapsular fractures.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: Present and future [^112mCDFU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused on maintaining serum calcium levels with oral calcium and active vitamin D. This often requires high doses, raising concerns about long-term consequences, including renal and brain calcifications. Recently, replacement therapy with PTH has become available. This paper summarizes the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding the physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, as well as the management of acute hypocalcemia, the clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D, along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handling of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness, help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency, presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) offers hope that managing hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with biochemical abnormalities in children undergoing vitamin D testing [^115GDPUW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in children can cause hypocalcaemia and rickets, but the prevalence of these complications and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations below which they arise remain uncertain. We investigated these issues in children under 18 years of age with 25OHD measurements.

We obtained 25OHD results from the regional laboratory database, alongside albumin-adjusted serum calcium (aCa), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), within six months of the index 25OHD. Confirmed VDD with biochemical abnormalities (VDDba) was defined as all three criteria being met: low aCa, elevated PTH, and elevated ALP. Possible/potential VDDba was defined as meeting two of the three VDDba criteria with the third test either missing (possible) or in the normal range (potential). Clinical records of identified cases were reviewed, and a consensus diagnosis was reached.

A total of 30,663 25OHD measurements were identified over 11.5 years (1 January 2009 to 15 June 2020) with a mean age of 8 years and 47% female. After excluding ineligible results, 12,858 25OHD measurements from 9,516 individuals with at least two aCa, PTH, and ALP measurements were analyzed. The median 25OHD was 61 nmol/L; 36% were below 50 nmol/L, and 10% were below 25 nmol/L. A total of 152 index 25OHD measurements were categorized as VDDba (30 confirmed, 23 possible, and 99 potential). Following record review, 118 individuals (111 under 3 years) had 120 clinically confirmed VDDba episodes, including 62 with clinical rickets, 15 with biochemical rickets, 16 with hypocalcaemia, 23 with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and 4 with partially treated rickets. Fifty-six individuals had undetectable 25OHD, and 104 were below 25 nmol/L.

### Vitamin D in primary hyperparathyroidism: Effects on clinical, biochemical, and densitometric presentation [^114AWxhq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]) deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL) are common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but data regarding their skeletal effects in PHPT are limited. The objective was to evaluate the association between 25OHD levels and PHPT severity.

This is a cross-sectional analysis of 100 PHPT patients with and without 25OHD insufficiency and deficiency from a university hospital setting. We measured calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual X-ray absorptiometry.

Lower 25OHD was associated with some indicators of PHPT severity (PTH: r = -0.42; P < .0001; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D: r = -0.27; p = 0.008; serum PO4: r = 0.31; p = 0.002), but not all (serum/urine calcium). Lower 25OHD was also associated with younger age, higher body mass index, male gender, better renal function, and lower vitamin D intake.

Comparison of those with deficient (< 20 ng/mL; 19%) vs. insufficient (20–29 ng/mL; 35%) vs. replete (≥ 30 ng/mL; 46%) 25OHD demonstrated more severe PHPT, as reflected by higher PTH (mean ± SEM, 126 ± 10 vs. 81 ± 7 vs. 72 ± 7 pg/mL; P < .0001) but no difference in nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures, serum or urinary calcium, bone turnover markers, or BMD after adjustment for age and weight. In women, T-scores at the 1/3 radius were lower in those with 25OHD of 20–29 ng/mL compared to those who were vitamin D replete (P = 0.048). In multiple regression modeling, 25OHD (but not PTH) was an independent predictor.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111mfiHt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in pediatric patients concerning daily requirements, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring a vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day for infants and children aged 0–1 year, and at least 600 IU/day for children aged 1 year and older, to maximize bone health. There is insufficient evidence to confirm whether 400 and 600 IU/day for children aged 0–1 and 1–18 years, respectively, are adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. It is recognized that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be necessary to consistently raise serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^1179Eu9X]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Despite major progress in recent decades in understanding the role of vitamin D and its metabolites in calcium and bone homeostasis, many important questions remain incompletely answered. There is at least one missing player in our understanding of the role and mechanism of action of the vitamin D system on transepithelial calcium transport in the intestine. The precise role of the vitamin D endocrine system in other calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing systems, such as the kidney, placenta, breast, and parathyroid glands, is also still incomplete. The role of 1,25(OH)2D production in calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing tissues and its autocrine/paracrine effects should also be defined. Additionally, the precise contribution of the vitamin D system to overall phosphate homeostasis is incompletely understood.

A better understanding of the risk factors for the development of nutritional rickets beyond vitamin D deficiency is required, such as dietary calcium intake, iron deficiency, and genotype. Clarification is needed regarding the effect of vitamin D status on skeletal development during fetal life, childhood, and adolescence. Most RCTs use daily doses of vitamin D between 400 and 1200 IU; the effect of higher doses is not well known. The impact of vitamin D metabolites or analogs on bone structure, turnover, and fracture incidence remains unclear. Notably, most trials have not selected participants based on low serum 25OHD levels. Forthcoming trials should select participants with low baseline serum 25OHD.

Hypocalcemia can be caused by various factors. Some possible causes include:

- **Nutritional and metabolic disorders**: vitamin D dependent rickets type 1, hypoalbuminemia, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D dependent rickets type 2a, pyle metaphyseal dysplasia, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia/type 1, autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, proximal renal tubular acidosis, osteomalacia

- **Systemic conditions and diseases**: rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, complications of blood transfusion, Neisseria meningitis infection, hypoparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, cystinosis, malignant osteopetrosis, acute pancreatitis

In addition, certain medications can induce hypocalcemia. These include:

### A challenging case of hypocalcemia supporting the concept that 25-hydroxyvitamin D status is important for intestinal calcium absorption [^111Usgeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Intestinal mucosa appears to be responsive not only to circulating calcitriol but also to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. We report a complex patient with chronic kidney disease who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia (ionized calcium, 0.77 mmol/liter) despite regular calcitriol and calcium supplementation.

Case history, laboratory evaluation, and bone biopsies are discussed. Only vigorous treatment with intramuscular cholecalciferol resulted in a significant improvement of serum calcium, a decrease in PTH levels, and histological improvement of osteomalacic bone disease. However, oral anticoagulation became necessary for advanced peripheral artery disease, which precluded further intramuscular injections. Therefore, UVB phototherapy was initiated to treat vitamin D deficiency.

This case is clinically relevant because it demonstrates that efficient calcium absorption is markedly reduced in profound vitamin D deficiency, even with normal active vitamin D levels. It is crucial to stay aware of vitamin D deficiency in patients with compromised kidney function, irrespective of regular calcitriol replacement. When both parenteral and oral vitamin D administration are contraindicated, ineffective, or unavailable, UVB phototherapy is an effective option to treat vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, this case underlines the importance of obtaining regular 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in complex clinical cases when predicting individual response is unreliable.

### Vitamin D-binding protein modifies the vitamin D-bone mineral density relationship [^1115CLtR]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with decreased calcium absorption and elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which may lead to excessive bone resorption. In some observational studies, higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have been linked to increased bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased risk of fracture. Additionally, several randomized controlled trials suggest that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of fracture and increases BMD. However, not all observational studies have confirmed the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and BMD, especially in younger populations or racial minorities. Moreover, in several randomized trials, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD or fracture risk has been modest, absent, or reversed.

The free hormone hypothesis postulates that only hormones liberated from binding proteins enter cells and produce biological action. 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] circulate bound to vitamin D-binding protein (85% to 90%) and albumin (10% to 15%), with less than 1% of circulating hormone in its free form. In mice, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) prolongs the serum half-life of 25(OH)D and protects against vitamin D deficiency by serving as a vitamin D reservoir. However, DBP also limits the biological activity of injected 1,25(OH)2D3 in mice and inhibits the action of vitamin D on monocytes and keratinocytes in vitro. The significance of circulating DBP levels with regard to vitamin D's biological action in humans is unclear.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^113sKttb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Treatment and monitoring of HypoPT during pregnancy is essential. Active vitamin D treatment and calcium supplements are the main treatment modalities during pregnancy, with the goal of maintaining an albumin-adjusted and/or ionized calcium level at the lower end of the normal range. Native vitamin D supplements are recommended to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations within the normal range, and magnesium supplements should be used in the case of a deficiency. In severe (life-threatening) acute hypocalcemia with tetany and/or cardiac arrhythmias, we suggest, as an emergency treatment, the intravenous infusion of 1 to 2 g of calcium gluconate over 10 minutes.

It is critical to avoid both hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia in the mother during pregnancy. Maternal hypercalcemia leads to fetal hypercalcemia, potentially suppressing PTH levels and causing HypoPT, which poses a risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia in the newborn after birth. Conversely, maternal hypocalcemia may not lead to fetal hypocalcemia until maternal serum calcium is severely reduced, as calcium is transferred via the placenta to the fetus at the expense of the maternal skeleton. Severe and longstanding maternal hypocalcemia can cause fetal hypocalcemia during pregnancy. This, in turn, may lead to fetal hyperparathyroidism, demineralization of the fetal skeleton, and increased risk of intrauterine fractures, low birth weight, and fetal death. While earlier case reports and case series suggested a relatively high risk of pregnancy complications for women with HypoPT, recent larger national registry studies have documented more comprehensive data.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1136hzEY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In healthy individuals, hypervitaminosis D is usually defined as "exogenous" as it develops after uncontrolled use of megadoses of vitamin D or its metabolites or analogues. This is evident in cases of high doses of calcifediol, which lead to a faster increase in 25(OH)D serum levels compared with cholecalciferol, although it is easier to manage than cholecalciferol toxicity due to its hydrophilicity and lesser sequestration in adipose tissue. On the other hand, excessive production of calcitriol in granulomatous disorders, lymphomas, primary hyperparathyroidism, and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia results in "endogenous" hypervitaminosis D.

Vitamin D toxicity (VDT) is defined by a biochemical phenotype with markedly elevated calcifediol concentrations (> 150 ng/mL or > 375 nmol/L), along with dihydroxylated metabolites (24,25(OH)2D3; 25,26(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3–26,23-lactone), unless the causal agents are vitamin D analogues, such as paricalcitol. Calcitriol levels may be in the normal reference range or even reduced in exogenous VDT while elevated in endogenous VDT. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels can be very low or undetectable. VDT thus results in severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia.

Pathogenetically, hypercalcemia is a consequence of high calcifediol levels in exogenous VDT, with calcifediol at pharmacological concentrations overcoming vitamin D receptor (VDR) affinity disadvantages and/or displacing 1,25(OH)D2 from DBP, while high calcitriol levels cause endogenous VDT. Exogenous factors that interact with VDT risk include dosage, calcium in the diet or as a supplement, vitamin D intake with the diet, and social status.

### Postoperative PTH measurement is not a reliable predictor for hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy in vitamin D deficiency: Prospective study of 203 cases [^115VS7jc]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Several factors have been used to predict post-total thyroidectomy (TT) hypocalcemia. Serum intact PTH (PTH) levels were compared between patients who were vitamin D sufficient (PTH > 20 ng/mL) and those who were vitamin D deficient (group B). Further comparison was performed between patients from group A and group B who developed hypocalcemia. Appropriate statistical tests were applied.

- **Results**: A total of 203 patients (19 males, 184 females) underwent TT. Of these, 58.6% (n = 119) belonged to group A and 41.4% (n = 84) to group B. Their mean age was 36.81 ± 12.9 years, and the mean duration of goiter was 45.35 ± 54.6 months. Hypocalcemia occurred in 41 patients (20.2%). Among them, 15 belonged to group A and 26 to group B (p = 0.002). The mean PTH in patients who developed hypocalcemia was 12.75 ± 8.91, compared to 22.58 ± 15.38 in those who did not develop hypocalcemia (p = 0.00). Furthermore, it was observed that the mean PTH in vitamin D sufficient hypocalcemic patients (n = 15) was 7.12 ± 1.79, while in vitamin D deficient hypocalcemic patients (n = 26), it was 16 ± 9.77 (p = 0.001). Our findings suggest that the fall in PTH after TT in vitamin D deficient patients is unreliable.

### Should vitamin D deficiency be corrected before parathyroidectomy [^1161Nehi]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with hyperparathyroidism, but the importance of replacement before surgery is controversial. We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the extent of resection and risk of postoperative hypocalcemia for patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism.

- **Methods**: We identified patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery between 2000 and 2015 using a prospectively maintained database. Patients with normal (≥ 30 ng/mL) vitamin D were compared to those with levels less than 30 ng/mL.

- **Results**: There were 1015 (54%) patients with normal vitamin D and 872 (46%) patients with vitamin D deficiency undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone (median 90 versus 77 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and calcium (median 10.5 versus 10.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001) compared with normal vitamin D. To achieve similar cure rates, patients with vitamin D deficiency were less likely to require removal of more than one gland (20% versus 30%, P < 0.001) than patients with normal vitamin D. Patients with vitamin D deficiency had similar rates of persistent (1.5% versus 2.0%, P = 0.43) and recurrent (1.7% versus 2.6%, P = 0.21) hyperparathyroidism. Postoperatively, both groups had equivalent rates of transient (2.3% versus 2.3%, P = 0.97) and permanent (0.2% versus 0.4%, P = 0.52) hypocalcemia.

- **Conclusions**: Restoring vitamin D in deficient patients should not delay the appropriate surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Fosamax [^117P7Xcu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mineral metabolism**: Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with Fosamax. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism, such as vitamin D deficiency, should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with Fosamax.

	- Presumably due to the effects of Fosamax on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. This is especially true in patients with Paget's disease, where the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, where calcium absorption may be decreased. Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is particularly important in these patient groups.

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. This category of drugs includes Fosamax (alendronate). Most of the affected patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop, as most patients experienced relief after stopping. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1147pFqd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been extensively related to the occurrence of skeletal disorders, such as rickets and osteomalacia. It can also be negatively implicated in osteopenia and osteoporosis, which must be managed with vitamin D supplements. More recently, the interest in the putative extraskeletal effects of vitamin D has resulted in several clinical trials addressing vitamin D's influence on cancer and cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The null results of some of these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — especially the megatrials — hampered the enthusiasm around these topics. However, these trials were progressively revised, and their null results were mainly related to the enrollment of vitamin D–replete adults in whom benefit would be unlikely and the inhomogeneous methodologies in vitamin D supplementation with different forms, metabolites, and doses.

Indeed, subsequent secondary analyses have progressively shown that vitamin D might be useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the long term, in reducing autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular events (in particular central arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation) occurrence, and the development of diabetes from prediabetes forms. Nonetheless, these RCTs and the following meta-analyses were not powerful enough to evaluate these crucial subgroups, and further studies with better methodological conductions are warranted.

Regarding the different forms and metabolites used for vitamin D supplementation, oral administration is the preferred route, and parenteral administration is less common.

### Differential diagnosis of vitamin D-related hypercalcemia using serum vitamin D metabolite profiling [^11159Frx]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Low credibility.

Genetic causes of vitamin D-related hypercalcemia are known to involve mutation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase CYP24A1 or the sodium phosphate co-transporter SLC34A1, resulting in excessive 1,25-(OH)2D hormonal action. However, at least 20% of idiopathic hypercalcemia (IH) cases remain unresolved. In this case-control study, we used precision vitamin D metabolite profiling based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of an expanded range of vitamin D metabolites to screen German and French cohorts of hypercalcemia patients. This aimed to identify patients with altered vitamin D metabolism where involvement of CYP24A1 or SLC34A1 mutation had been ruled out and who possessed normal 25-OH-D3:24,25-(OH)2D3 ratios. Profiles were compared with those of hypercalcemia patients with hypervitaminosis D, Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), CYP24A1 mutation, and normal subjects with a range of 25-OH-D levels.

We observed that certain IH and WBS patients exhibited a unique profile comprising eightfold to tenfold higher serum 23,25,26-(OH)3D3 and 25-OH-D3–26,23-lactone than normals, as well as very low serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 (2–5 pg/ml) and elevated 1,24,25-(OH)3D3. This suggests hypersensitive expression of vitamin D-dependent genes, including CYP24A1, as a general underlying mechanism of hypercalcemia in these patients. Because serum 25-OH-D3 and 24,25-(OH)2D3 remained normal, we excluded the possibility that the aberrant profile was caused by hypervitaminosis D. Instead, it points to an underlying genetic cause that parallels the effect of certain mutations.

### Vitamin D and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^113vE7rs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the chronic kidney disease population. Vitamin D is often administered to patients to mitigate detrimental effects on bone health and mineral metabolism, though this treatment may be limited by elevations in serum calcium and phosphorus. This article reviews the basic physiology of vitamin D, the survival data in patients receiving vitamin D, and the quandary of whether vitamin D administration is beneficial in chronic kidney disease.

Despite potential increases in serum calcium and phosphorus due to activation of vitamin D receptors in the gut, vitamin D administration has been associated with a survival benefit in recent studies. While the mechanism for this possible benefit is unknown, vitamin D administration may have effects beyond its traditional role in mineral metabolism, mediated through the activation of vitamin D receptors distributed in a variety of tissues.

Data currently suggests that the administration of vitamin D confers a survival benefit to patients on dialysis. There is no clear mechanism, however, to explain this association. Further research is needed to clarify the expanding role of vitamin D receptor activation, particularly in vascular calcification, and the effects of the different forms of vitamin D.

### Denosumab-induced severe hypocalcaemia in a patient with vitamin D deficiency [^1117YTCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal women are at increased risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures carry an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast-induced bone resorption. Hypocalcaemia is a known side effect of denosumab treatment. The majority of such cases have been described in patients with underlying metastatic cancer or chronic kidney disease.

We present a patient who developed severe hypocalcaemia after administration of denosumab in the context of severe vitamin D deficiency and normal kidney function. The management was further complicated by hypophosphatemia. Following the replacement of vitamin D, the patient's calcium and phosphate levels stabilized. The patient required intensive care monitoring for the replacement of electrolytes. This case report emphasizes the importance of screening and ongoing monitoring of risk factors for iatrogenic hypocalcaemia with denosumab treatment.

### The many etiologies of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures [^115pUhJy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Seizures during the neonatal period have a broad differential diagnosis. Unlike in developing countries where hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia constitute a major cause of infantile seizures, the number of neonatal seizures attributed to hypocalcemia in developed countries has decreased dramatically due to the improvement of infant formulas and vitamin D supplementation. In these countries, most infants presenting with hypocalcemic seizures have underlying endocrinological etiologies rather than dietary insufficiencies. Here, we describe three cases of neonatal seizures due to hypocalcemia. Although the symptoms and calcium concentrations at presentation were similar in all three cases, the course of the disease and the final diagnosis for each were distinct. The cases are presented along with a brief review of the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal hypocalcemia.

### Screening of vitamin D and calcium concentrations in neonates of mothers at high risk of vitamin D deficiency [^112MGewS]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD)) deficiency is a global health problem and, together with poor calcium intake, is responsible for nutritional rickets and osteomalacia. When severe, it leads to fractures and skeletal deformities in growing infants and children, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic hypocalcemia in the form of cardiomyopathy, tetany, and seizures. Although vitamin D is primarily required to maintain serum calcium homeostasis, there is increasing evidence that it may play a role in many other metabolic and physiological processes apart from maintaining bone health.

Vitamin D deficiency is especially prevalent during pregnancy in women with dark skin pigmentation and/or reduced ultraviolet radiation exposure due to ethno-cultural factors such as modest/concealed clothing, application of sunscreen, or less outdoor activity due to chronic illness and obesity. The re-emergence of nutritional rickets in countries like Australia is not surprising due to increased immigration and diversity of ethnic groups, and thus a high proportion of the population is in the high-risk category of vitamin D and calcium deficiency.

The risk of nutritional rickets is greatest when vitamin D deficiency and dietary calcium deficiency are combined. If a child is deficient in only vitamin D or calcium, adequate bone mineralization can still be sustained. An exception to this is neonates and infants, who are growing rapidly and need both adequate vitamin D and calcium intake for bone mineralization. Neonates of vitamin D-deficient mothers or those at risk of vitamin D deficiency…

### Hyperparathyroidism and malnutrition with severe vitamin D deficiency [^112gUCgY]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency and its associated problems are common in developing Asian countries and countries of the Middle East. Various factors, including poor nutritional status and other compounding factors such as dietary, cultural, ethnic, and environmental influences, play a major role in contributing to poor calcium and vitamin D homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to exacerbate the signs and symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). In this overview, we present evidence of the impact of vitamin D and calcium deficiency on primary HPT (PHPT).

- **Methods**: We performed an evidence-based review of articles published in the English language between January 1960 and June 2008.

- **Results**: Level IV evidence suggests widespread calcium and vitamin D deficiency in developing countries (issue 1). Limited level IV evidence suggests malnutrition as a primary cause of calcium and vitamin D deficiency (issue 2). Level IV evidence suggests that calcium and vitamin deficiencies cause secondary HPT and possibly PHPT as well (issues 3 and 4). A literature search revealed only six studies that correlated vitamin D levels with clinical, biochemical, and pathologic features of PHPT (issue 5). These studies provide level IV evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency causes some specific clinical features of PHPT as well as exacerbating other features of the disease.

- **Conclusions**: In the developing countries, which have severe vitamin D and calcium deficient populations, PHPT patients present with advanced disease and particularly severe bone symptoms. There is presently only leve

### Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with circulating PTH, phosphate and calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^114osHtk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite NIH clinical recommendations, many clinicians are reluctant to replace vitamin D in patients with hypercalcemia with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) due to concerns over aggravating hypercalcemia. Furthermore, the optimum level of vitamin D replacement in PHP remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We performed a large retrospective study to determine whether a relationship exists between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and calcium and other important biochemical markers in patients with PHP. Serum, plasma, and urinary biochemical measurements were collected from 251 patients with hypercalcemia diagnosed with PHP.

- **Results**: When examining overall mean circulating levels during clinical follow-up, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated highly significantly with plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) (r = -0.23, P = 0.0003) and serum phosphate (r = 0.16, P = 0.0119). No significant relationship was observed between serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.002, P = 0.98). Mean plasma PTH during clinical follow-up was 51% lower in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 60 nm when compared with patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 20 nm. Patients with vitamin D levels > 60 nm have significantly reduced PTH hypersecretion when compared with patients with deficient vitamin D levels, without exhibiting worse hypercalcemia.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^114WZb3z]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency appears with an increased prevalence among PHPT patients compared with the general population. However, it seems that lower total 25OH-vitamin D levels described in patients with PHPT do not align with their free 25OH-vitamin D levels; the latter may be similar to or even higher than those in healthy controls. Numerous articles have been published regarding both the role of vitamin D status of PHPT patients in the severity of bone disease and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on deficient PHPT patients.

In recent studies, vitamin D deficiency significantly increased the risk of postoperative hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, a higher requirement for calcium supplementation, and longer hospitalization. Additionally, it has been associated with increased parathyroid gland weight, higher PTH, ALP, and calcium levels, as well as more end-organ involvement, including reduced BMD and deteriorated hip geometry in postmenopausal PHPT women. Conversely, Walker et al. reported that vitamin D levels were not associated with nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures, serum or urinary calcium, biochemical bone turnover markers, or BMD. Moreover, the same research group documented no significant differences in bone microarchitecture and strength, as assessed by HRpQCT, among PHPT patients with vitamin D deficiency (25OH-vitamin D < 20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL), and repletion (≥ 30 ng/mL).

Clinical studies investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in PHPT patients have also yielded controversial results.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114FEWuH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning vitamin D deficiency, particularly regarding patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in the preoperative phase, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of vitamin D as needed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. It is important to monitor serum calcium levels.

### Does pre-operative vitamin D deficiency predict postoperative hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy [^115NvcC7]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative hypocalcemia is frequent after total thyroidectomy. The role of pre-operative vitamin D levels in the pathogenesis of this condition has not been studied under most guidelines for evaluating the role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis. We hypothesized that patients who are vitamin D deficient (VDD) pre-operatively are more likely to suffer from postoperative hypocalcemia, thereby requiring prolonged hospitalization.

Methods involved a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy at the University of New Mexico Hospital between 2005 and 2014. Patients who underwent intentional parathyroidectomy were excluded. The study included 30 patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels obtained within 12 months before surgery.

Results showed that twelve patients who were VDD (25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 20 ng/mL) were compared to 18 patients who did not have VDD (non-VDD; 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 20 ng/mL). The mean nadir postoperative ionized calcium concentration was lower in the VDD group (0.99 ± 0.10 vs. 1.06 ± 0.06 mmol/L, P = 0.04) (reference range = 1.15–1.27 mmol/L), as was the postoperative concentration of phosphorus (3.48 ± 0.60 vs. 4.17 ± 0.84 mg/dL, P = 0.03). VDD patients had a longer length of stay (4.3 ± 4.4 vs. 1.7 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Three patients in the VDD group required intravenous calcium for the treatment of symptomatic hypocalcemia, but none of the non-VDD patients required this intervention (P = 0.054).

### Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in early infantile hypocalcemia [^116jhUiT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

To further define the pathogenesis of infantile hypocalcemia, the prevailing vitamin D status, and treatment outcomes, a study was conducted involving 23 infants admitted with infantile hypocalcemia. Among them, 21 exhibited biochemical evidence of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, while the remaining two presented with isolated hypocalcemia. The majority of these infants showed relatively low serum intact parathyroid hormone responses in the context of hypocalcemia.

Thirteen infants (56.5%) had low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels; among these, 69% were Hispanic and 23% were African American. In all 16 instances where it was measured, infant serum vitamin D status mirrored that of the mother. Treatment with calcitriol accelerated the recovery from hypocalcemia in this series.

The study concludes that relative hypoparathyroidism is the primary etiology in most cases of late onset and early infantile hypocalcemia. A significant percentage of infants, particularly those of Hispanic and African American descent, exhibited vitamin D deficiency. It is recommended that maternal 25-OHD concentrations be assessed if the infant presents with low 25-OHD levels.

### Relationship between vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and bone health [^111j9dXD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

There is a controversy regarding the definition of vitamin D insufficiency as it relates to bone health. This study's objective was to examine the evidence for a threshold value of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) that defines vitamin D insufficiency as it relates to bone health.

- **Design and participants**: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in 488 elderly Caucasian women, with a mean age of 71 years. It was combined with a literature review of 70 studies on the relationship of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) to serum 25OHD.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in independent-living women in the Midwest United States.

- **Main outcome measure**: The relationship between serum 25OHD, serum PTH, serum osteocalcin, and 24-hour urine N-telopeptides was evaluated.

- **Results**: Serum PTH was inversely correlated with serum 25OHD (r = -0.256, P < 0.0005), but no threshold as defined by suppression of serum PTH was found within the serum 25OHD range of 6–60 ng/ml (15–150 nmol/liter). However, a threshold for bone markers, serum osteocalcin, and urine N-telopeptides was observed, which increased only below a serum 25OHD of approximately 18 ng/ml (45 nmol/liter). Calcium absorption was not correlated with serum PTH and serum 25OHD, and no threshold was found. A literature review of 70 studies generally showed a threshold for serum PTH with increasing serum 25OHD, but there was no consistency in the threshold level of serum 25OHD that varied from 10 to 50 ng/ml (25–125 nmol/liter).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D insufficiency should be defined as serum 25OHD levels less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter).

### Preoperative vitamin D deficiency predicts postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy [^1131EVpL]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Transient post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia occurs in up to 30% of patients. This study evaluates the effect of vitamin D deficiency on post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

- **Methods**: Data were collected prospectively between January 2006 and March 2009. A total of 166 consecutive total thyroidectomies were analyzed regarding the relation between preoperative vitamin D3 levels and postoperative corrected calcium levels. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the preoperative vitamin D3 level. Group 1 was set at 50 nmol/L (with a conversion factor of 2.5× between nanomoles per liter and nanograms per milliliter). Hypocalcemia was defined as a postoperative calcium level equal to or lower than 2.0 mmol/L (8 mg/dL). Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher incidence of hypocalcemia in patients with low preoperative vitamin D3 levels.

- **Results**: Hypocalcemia was observed in 82% of patients with vitamin D3 levels lower than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). In comparison, the incidence was 46% in patients with higher vitamin D3 levels (> 50 nmol/L, > 20 ng/mL). Vitamin D3 deficiency was also associated with a longer hospital stay, with a median stay of 2 days compared to 1 day for those with adequate vitamin D3 levels (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin D deficiency leads to a delay in discharge due to a higher likelihood of hypocalcemia. There is a significant difference in the incidence of hypocalcemia between patients with preoperative vitamin D3 levels greater than 50 nmol/L (> 20 ng/mL) and those with a level of less than 25 nmol/L (< 10 ng/mL).

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^1175pj7L]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The etiology of endemic rickets was discovered a century ago. Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)₂D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D–deficient elderly subjects. VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects, including regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties. Observational studies in human subjects show poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies support vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases. However, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define these roles.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: A narrative review [^116qwvag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

There are several unanswered questions regarding hypoparathyroidism, and further studies are necessary. For example, hypocalcemia has been reported in patients with viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Ebola-virus. However, the mechanism and natural course of this hypocalcemia have not been well characterized.

The mechanism underlying the profound increase in bone mass in hypoparathyroidism is not clearly understood. PTH treatment improves several symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with hypoparathyroidism. However, it is not completely understood whether this improvement is caused by direct actions of PTH on various tissues or by better control of serum calcium (s-Ca) levels. It is not clear what the optimal s-Ca levels are for a given patient, as some patients complain of symptoms even when s-Ca is normal. It is possible that the lack of PTH accounts for such problems.

Many etiologies for hypoparathyroidism have been identified, but the pathogenesis remains unexplained in a large number of patients. The term idiopathic or primary hypoparathyroidism is still used in the literature because it is difficult to determine the etiologies in all cases of hypoparathyroidism. Future research should address the as yet unknown causes of this disease.

The value of emerging technologies and intraoperative assessment of parathyroid viability on the functionality of the parathyroid glands after surgical manipulation merits further assessment.

### Prolia [^115ZQPwk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prolia can cause severe hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Prolia. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Severe hypocalcemia and mineral metabolism changes**: In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of the small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to 14 days after Prolia injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

- **Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease**: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²], including dialysis-dependent patients, are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following Prolia administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events, and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk.

To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, it is essential to monitor and manage mineral metabolism changes appropriately.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112X1b5H]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementation, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al. calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight. Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations, although monthly dosing is associated with more variability, and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens and including patients receiving 10,000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded. With regard to recent megatrial results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4,000 to 10,000 IU per day in the Calgary study.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^115jERpW]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Severe vitamin D deficiency, defined as 30 nmol/L, in infants or children can lead to rickets. The vitamin D endocrine system has limited involvement in prenatal life but becomes active shortly after birth. Since fetal serum 25OHD levels reflect maternal levels, maternal vitamin D deficiency raises the risk of nutritional rickets and hypocalcemia during the initial months of life. The vitamin D content in maternal milk or non-fortified cow milk is low, and direct sunlight exposure for infants or small children may pose a risk. Due to widespread vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/d in most Western countries for many decades, the incidence of rickets in Western populations remains low. However, without such supplementation, as seen with macrobiotic diets or among children of non-Western immigrants, rickets incidence sharply increases.

In the United Kingdom, low adherence to vitamin D supplementation among the very young has led to a resurgence of rickets and even fatalities from cardiomyopathy. This is partly due to the increase in the non-white population, which rose from 5.9% in 1991 to 14% in 2011. A consistent daily supply of 400 IU of vitamin D can prevent nutritional rickets, as clearly demonstrated in Turkey, where the incidence decreased from 6% to 0.1%. Nonetheless, rickets may develop independent of vitamin D status if calcium intake is below 250/300 mg daily for children up to 12 months and older. Nutritional rickets is a risk factor for fractures in children and adolescents and can also have major consequences.

### Thyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone competing to maintain calcium levels in the presence of vitamin D deficiency [^112y4k9e]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Weight loss and bone disease in the elderly are very often attributed to malignancy. Rarely, benign treatable conditions may be overlooked. Thyrotoxicosis, a benign treatable condition, needs to be excluded in such patients. The diagnosis may be delayed since the symptoms are often subtle, and secondary complications, including bone disease (osteoporosis), are therefore more frequent at the time of presentation. This case illustrates this well and also highlights the value of measuring vitamin D levels in such patients. The most interesting aspect is the reciprocal relationship between thyroxine and parathyroid hormone observed in maintaining calcium homeostasis in this thyrotoxic patient with low vitamin D levels.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^116ZsM5f]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Despite its name, infantile hypercalcemia, type 1 affects individuals throughout life, often causing nephrolithiasis. It is particularly problematic in pregnant females due to the placental production of 1,25(OH)2D3, which cannot be efficiently metabolized. The utility of measuring 24-hydroxylated forms, particularly the 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)2D ratio, has been established as a useful screening tool by groups worldwide. Ratios elevate from 5 to 25 in normal individuals to more than 80 in individuals affected by infantile hypercalcemia. It's crucial to recognize that adults with unexplained 1,25(OH)2D-dependent hypercalcemia may also display this enzymatic defect. These adults present with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones, and suppressed levels of PTH.

- **Other hypercalcemias**: Many causes of hypercalcemia can be distinguished by their distinctive pattern of vitamin D metabolites. Kaufmann et al. identified several patient groups by studying the vitamin D metabolome. These groups include patients with Williams syndrome exhibiting an elevated level of 25(OH)D-26,23-lactone, a stable metabolite with high affinity for DBP; and patients with hypervitaminosis D who take toxic doses of vitamin D, displaying very high 25(OH)D but suppressed 1,25(OH)2D, along with contributions from several other vitamin D metabolites.

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Numerous studies have documented a decrease in serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D corresponding with a decline in renal function. Studies examining the vitamin D metabolome over time exhibit this trend.

### Calcitriol [^1165jeuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: Since calcitriol is the most potent metabolite of vitamin D available, prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld or used with caution during treatment to avoid the risk of hypercalcemia. A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound should be used to control serum phosphorous levels in patients undergoing dialysis.

- **Overdosage**: Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous. Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis, and other soft tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca × P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg²/dL². Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1143e3eh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly for neonatal and pediatric patients, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring a vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day for infants and children aged 0–1 year and at least 600 IU/day for children aged ≥ 1 year. This intake aims to maximize bone health. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 400 and 600 IU/day for children aged 0–1 and 1–18 years, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. To maximize bone health and muscle function, it is recognized that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D3 deficiency is associated with late-onset hypocalcemia after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in a vitamin D borderline area [^116p1BxD]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D3 deficiency is common in primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). We aimed to examine the clinicopathologic features and short-term outcomes of vitamin D3-deficient patients after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP).

- **Methods**: Over a 2-year period, 80 consecutive MIP patients had preoperative fasting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) checked. Forty-five patients had a 25OHD3 level below 25 ng/mL and were considered deficient. Short-term surgical outcomes and biochemical features were compared between vitamin D3-deficient and intact groups.

- **Results**: Vitamin D3-deficient patients exhibited higher preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, averaging 165 pg/mL compared to 127 pg/mL in the intact group (p = 0.004). Additionally, the risk of late-onset hypocalcemia (LOH) was significantly higher in the deficient group, with incidence rates of 15 out of 57 versus 0 out of 19 in the intact group (p = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D3 deficiency was associated with a higher preoperative PTH level and a greater risk of LOH after MIP.

### Low serum calcium is associated with poor renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease stages 3–4 patients [^113uyojE]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Several potential mechanisms could explain our study observations. First, hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D deficiency could be associated with increased circulating FGF-23 levels and renal functional deterioration. Studies have shown an inverse association between renal function and FGF-23 levels in CKD. Isakova et al. evaluated a large prospective cohort of patients with CKD stages 2–4 and identified that elevated FGF-23 is an independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nakano et al. further reported that increased FGF-23 was significantly associated with a higher risk of ESRD, irrespective of CKD stage, and that serum calcium was associated with renal events after adjusting for FGF-23.

In an advanced CKD population, suboptimal levels of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ are frequently observed. Experimental and epidemiologic data have emphasized the contribution of a deficiency in vitamin D toward impaired kidney function. Low plasma 1,25(OH)₂D increases the likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis in patients with advanced CKD. De Boer et al. observed a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25(OH)D) and a rapid reduction in GFR in older adults with normal baseline kidney function. Therefore, hypocalcemia might indicate the severity of vitamin D deficiency and emphasize its pathophysiological role in renal functional decline.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, and more specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 IU/day is adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL.

### Severe vitamin D deficiency: A significant predictor of early hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy [^116my3yR]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the role of preoperative serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D as a predictor of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a university teaching hospital. All consecutively performed total and completion thyroidectomies from February 2007 to December 2013 were reviewed through a hospital database and patient charts. The relationship between postthyroidectomy laboratory hypocalcemia (serum calcium ≤ 2 mmol/L), clinical hypocalcemia, and preoperative serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D level was evaluated.

Two hundred thirteen patients were analyzed. The incidence of postoperative laboratory and clinical hypocalcemia was 19.7% and 17.8%, respectively. The incidence of laboratory and clinical hypocalcemia among severely deficient (< 25 nmol/L), deficient (< 50 nmol/L), insufficient (< 75 nmol/L), and sufficient (≥ 75 nmol/L) serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels was 54% versus 33.9%, 10% versus 18%, 2.9% versus 11.6%, and 3.1% versus 0%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed preoperative severe vitamin D deficiency as a significant independent predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia (odds ratio [OR], 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–22.9; p = 0.001). Parathyroid hormone level was also found to be an independent predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8; p = 0.002).

Postoperative clinical and laboratory hypocalcemia is significantly associated with low levels of serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D. Our findings identify severe vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/L) as a significant predictor of hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Phosphate is an essential component of the mineralized skeleton and plays a significant role in various physiological and cellular functions. Several mineral-regulating hormones, such as 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast-growth factor 23, modulate serum phosphate levels predominantly in the bone, kidney, and intestine. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms, and since serum phosphate is not routinely measured in laboratory analyses, disorders of hypophosphatemia are often overlooked during patient evaluations.

Significant progress has been made in recent decades in identifying the genetic causes of hypophosphatemic disorders and developing novel therapies. This review will discuss the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, types of disorders, and treatment options for hypophosphatemia.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112KAZmH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, calcitriol is not suitable for supplementation or nutritional fortification, and none of many excellent reviews, guidelines, and policy papers consider the use of calcitriol in the nutritional context. However, guidelines suggest that vitamin D supplementation is advised in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney failure, and low vitamin D status in addition to receiving therapeutic doses of calcitriol. Such a recommendation is motivated by the activity of extrarenal 1-α-hydroxylase, which is compromised by reduced renal function (i.e. not regulated by PTH) and is not regulated by feedback mechanisms.

- **Vitamin D safety and monitoring**: Vitamin D supplementation is generally a safe treatment with minimal adverse events and no need for strict monitoring. However, side effects of vitamin D treatment exist and can result in vitamin D toxicity (VDT).

- **Vitamin D toxicity**: VDT is a clinical condition characterized by excess vitamin D (hypervitaminosis D), resulting in severe hypercalcemia that may persist for a prolonged period, leading to serious health consequences. Signs and symptoms of VDT are related primarily to hypercalcemia, with complications encompassing adverse events in the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. VDT prevalence is unknown, but it is rare due to the wide therapeutic index of vitamin D. Evidence from systematic studies of VDT in humans is missing for ethical reasons, and data mostly stem from studies of VDT in animals and anecdotal reports.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112taDcv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but it responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. When treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identifying and appropriately managing at-risk patients.

Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified several risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. These include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels. It is, therefore, important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer.

Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found…

### Relationship between vitamin D deficiency and neonatal hypocalcemia: a meta-analysis [^114Zqtw3]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

We aimed to explore the associations of neonatal hypocalcemia with neonatal vitamin D deficiency and maternal vitamin D deficiency. A comprehensive systematic literature search using PubMed and Web of Science was performed for relevant articles from inception to February 17, 2023. We used odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect sizes for our meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot, Begg's test, and Egger regression test. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0.

A total of 11 studies were included and analyzed, including 452 newborns with hypocalcemia and 2,599 newborns with normal serum calcium level. Our research results revealed that vitamin D deficiency in newborns may be related to the higher prevalence of hypocalcemia (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.17–7.04). In addition, maternal vitamin D deficiency might also be a risk factor for neonatal hypocalcemia (OR: 7.83, 95% CI: 3.62–16.92). There was a significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and neonatal hypocalcemia. This meta-analysis indicates that newborns with vitamin D deficiency have a higher risk of hypocalcemia, and maternal vitamin D level plays a crucial role in this association. Vitamin D supplementation may have a positive effect in reducing the prevalence of neonatal hypocalcemia.
