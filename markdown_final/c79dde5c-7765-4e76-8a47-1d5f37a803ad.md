## Question

what would be the recommended annual wellness exam lab recommendations for a 22 yo F with hypertension, anxiety and seasonal allergies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for annual wellness exam laboratory recommendations for a 22-year-old woman with established hypertension, anxiety, and seasonal allergies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core, guideline-based monitoring for treated hypertension in a stable young adult. Then, I should verify what early-onset hypertension implies regarding a one-time secondary workup. Next, I will consider sex-specific issues relevant to a reproductive-age woman. After that, I need to check whether anxiety and seasonal allergies alter routine lab monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize annual versus once-only and conditional tests, and close with non-laboratory elements that meaningfully support hypertension control and long-term risk reduction [^112mzThn] [^113pLW7Y] [^1114ry3p] [^115NCHjR].

> Let me first confirm the core surveillance for hypertension that should typically be captured within an annual wellness visit for a stable patient. The baseline set includes renal function with serum creatinine and eGFR, electrolytes with emphasis on sodium and potassium, a measure of glucose metabolism such as fasting glucose or HbA1c, a fasting lipid profile, a urinalysis and ideally a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to screen for kidney damage, and a 12-lead ECG to assess for hypertension-mediated cardiac changes such as LVH, recognizing that the ECG is at least recommended at diagnosis and thereafter as clinically indicated rather than mandated at a fixed annual interval [^112mzThn] [^113pLW7Y] [^1114ry3p] [^1134nmk5].

> Wait, I should verify frequency expectations because "annual" can mean different things depending on prior results and comorbid risk. For stable hypertension with previously normal studies, repeating electrolytes, creatinine, fasting lipids, and glucose annually is reasonable, and ESC advises repeating creatinine, eGFR, and uACR at least yearly once CKD is present, which supports an annual cadence for kidney surveillance in patients at risk or with any abnormality; Hypertension Canada similarly notes that follow-up laboratory intervals should reflect the clinical situation during maintenance, which commonly aligns with yearly checks in stable patients [^1114ry3p] [^115NCHjR].

> Next, I should review age-specific implications because at 22 this is early-onset hypertension and that changes the calculus toward a secondary evaluation. I need to ensure a one-time screen for primary aldosteronism with the plasma aldosterone-renin ratio, since Endo-ERN 2024 recommends testing any patient with hypertension diagnosed before age 40, and I should also consider additional secondary workup tailored by clinical clues, with ESC 2024 recommending comprehensive screening for secondary causes in most young adults with hypertension and explicit attention to organ-damage assessment under age 40 to refine management thresholds and intensity of follow-up [^116tfr3W] [^114eDiT2] [^111fcR2S].

> Hold on, I should verify the scope of the secondary evaluation and not overreach. Renal imaging such as renal ultrasound is not universally "annual"; it is typically once as part of a targeted secondary workup if not previously done or if renovascular disease or structural kidney disease is suspected, which is consistent with ESC guidance to screen appropriately for secondary causes when suggestive features are present rather than to repeat imaging routinely without indications [^115pQeUo] [^114eDiT2].

> I will now examine thyroid considerations, given that thyroid disease is relatively prevalent in young women and can affect blood pressure. The ACC/AHA guideline harmonization indicates that TSH is recommended in the hypertension evaluation and the 2018 ACC/AHA document advises TSH and free T4 when symptoms or signs suggest hypo- or hyperthyroidism; in a secondary workup frame at this age, obtaining a one-time TSH, with reflex free T4 if abnormal, is reasonable even in the absence of strong symptoms, especially if the initial hypertension evaluation did not include it [^113RFeJ4] [^112J99hJ].

> But wait, what about sex-specific wellness elements that might change lab choices. Let me consider pregnancy testing and anemia. Routine pregnancy testing is not required at every wellness exam unless clinically indicated by missed menses, symptoms, or the use of teratogenic medications, whereas obtaining a baseline CBC in young women is reasonable to screen for anemia and to support medication safety, consistent with ACC/AHA harmonization that includes a complete blood count in the initial hypertension workup and OBGYN preventive care principles emphasizing individualized periodic assessments [^113RFeJ4] [^1117Mr9y].

> Next, I should review whether comorbid anxiety or seasonal allergies add laboratory requirements. Anxiety itself does not mandate routine laboratory monitoring unless pharmacotherapy requires it; for example, if a specific agent has hepatic considerations, then periodic liver function tests are appropriate, a concept consistent with harmonized guideline listings that include liver tests among optional assessments in certain settings. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is diagnosed and managed clinically; routine labs are not indicated, and I should also caution against oral decongestants like pseudoephedrine that can raise blood pressure, aligning with primary care allergy guidance and general hypertension management advice to avoid iatrogenic pressors in hypertensive patients [^113RFeJ4] [^112FVUn4] [^113jkGKb].

> Let me synthesize annual versus one-time and conditional tests into a practical cadence while I double-check each element against the guidelines. Annually for a stable 22-year-old with hypertension and prior normal results: a basic metabolic panel or equivalent to capture sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, creatinine and eGFR, and fasting glucose, a fasting lipid profile to support risk stratification in early-onset hypertension, and urinalysis with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to detect kidney damage; repeat ECG if new symptoms, target-organ damage suspicion, or interval clinical change emerges rather than strictly on a fixed annual cycle. At least once if not already done in early-onset hypertension: plasma aldosterone-renin ratio to screen for primary aldosteronism, TSH with reflex free T4 if abnormal, a CBC to establish a baseline and assess for anemia, and renal imaging only if secondary clues point to renovascular or structural disease. Conditional tests include HbA1c if fasting glucose is borderline or elevated, LFTs if medications or alcohol use warrant, and serum calcium if there are features suggesting hyperparathyroidism or unexplained hypercalcemia, recognizing that calcium is included in the ACC/AHA basic panel and that AAES details the laboratory confirmation of suspected primary hyperparathyroidism, while ADA-endorsed use of HbA1c supports nonfasting diagnostic confirmation when indicated [^112mzThn] [^1114ry3p] [^113RFeJ4] [^114fQoUh] [^114kWJK4].

> Hold on, I should verify that non-laboratory components of the annual wellness strategy are acknowledged because they materially influence control and the need for labs. Out-of-office blood pressure confirmation and periodic reassessment with home BP or ABPM improve diagnostic precision and monitoring of control, consistent with USPSTF, AAFP, and ESC recommendations; lifestyle counseling, medication adherence review, and screening for mood symptoms with validated tools should be incorporated into the visit plan even though they do not necessitate labs in this case, aligning with preventive care visit structures described for wellness encounters [^111mzPux] [^111d926m] [^1179itBy] [^115PL84o].

> I should double-check real-world feasibility and reinforce priorities because adherence to recommended testing is often suboptimal. Cohort data show low completion rates for labs within six months of new hypertension diagnosis, with particularly low rates for lipid panels and urinalysis, highlighting the need to prioritize the essential annual set in early-onset hypertension to close the evidence-practice gap and prevent missed opportunities for risk reduction and early detection of organ damage [^1118UZvv].

> Let me reconsider one detail I almost overstated: I initially thought to recommend an automatic annual ECG for everyone, but on reflection, guidelines clearly require ECG at baseline and then guided by clinical status rather than an inflexible yearly schedule; for this 22-year-old, I would repeat the ECG if symptoms arise, if blood pressure control is poor, or if there is concern for left ventricular hypertrophy or arrhythmia on examination or home monitoring, keeping the test tied to clinical need rather than a fixed calendar interval [^113pLW7Y] [^1134nmk5].

> In summary, for a 22-year-old woman with established hypertension and otherwise uncomplicated anxiety and seasonal allergies, I recommend annually obtaining electrolytes, creatinine with eGFR, fasting glucose or HbA1c, a fasting lipid profile, and urinalysis with uACR to surveil for kidney involvement; obtain a baseline ECG if not already done and repeat based on clinical triggers; complete one-time early-onset hypertension screening with an aldosterone-renin ratio, TSH with reflex free T4 if abnormal, a CBC, and targeted renal imaging only if suspicious features are present; add HbA1c, LFTs, and serum calcium selectively when clinically indicated, while reinforcing home or ambulatory BP monitoring, adherence, and lifestyle counseling to maintain control and minimize cumulative cardiovascular risk over decades of exposure to elevated blood pressure [^112mzThn] [^1114ry3p] [^116tfr3W] [^114eDiT2] [^111mzPux].

---

For a 22-year-old female with hypertension, anxiety, and seasonal allergies, the annual wellness exam should include **CBC, CMP, lipid panel**, **fasting glucose or HbA1c, TSH, urinalysis, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio** to assess cardiovascular risk, metabolic status, renal function, and thyroid disease. Add a **12-lead ECG** if hypertension is newly diagnosed or uncontrolled [^113pLW7Y]. Consider **secondary hypertension screening** (e.g. primary aldosteronism) in young adults with early-onset hypertension [^116tfr3W] [^114eDiT2]. Allergy testing is not routinely indicated unless symptoms are severe or refractory. Repeat labs annually or as clinically indicated [^115NCHjR], and monitor electrolytes and renal function if on antihypertensives [^1123DA34].

## Recommended laboratory tests

### Hypertension-related laboratory tests

Current guidelines **recommend** the following laboratory tests for the initial and annual evaluation of hypertension in young adults [^113RFeJ4]:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia or polycythemia, which can influence blood pressure and overall health [^113RFeJ4].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR), electrolytes (sodium, potassium), and liver function tests [^112mzThn].

- **Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c**: Screen for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as hypertension increases cardiovascular risk [^114kWJK4].

- **Lipid panel**: Evaluate cardiovascular risk factors, including total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides [^113FS4Vt].

- **Urinalysis**: Detect proteinuria or hematuria, indicating potential renal involvement [^112mzThn].

- **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio**: Assess for microalbuminuria, an early marker of renal damage [^1114ry3p].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction, which can contribute to hypertension and anxiety symptoms [^112J99hJ].

- **12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Recommended for initial evaluation or if hypertension is uncontrolled, to assess for cardiac involvement [^1134nmk5].

---

### Anxiety-related laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing for anxiety is **not generally recommended** unless clinically indicated; however, targeted tests may be considered to rule out medical conditions that can mimic or exacerbate anxiety symptoms:

- **TSH**: Already included above, to rule out thyroid dysfunction [^111Sn8K5].

- **CBC**: Already included above, to rule out anemia or other hematologic conditions.

- **CMP**: Already included above, to assess electrolyte imbalances or metabolic disturbances.

---

### Seasonal allergy-related laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing for seasonal allergies is **not typically required** unless symptoms are severe, refractory, or atypical. When clinically indicated, consider **allergy testing (skin prick or specific IgE blood tests)** based on symptom severity and patient history [^116pA188].

---

## Frequency of laboratory testing

These laboratory tests are **generally annual**, unless clinical circumstances warrant more frequent monitoring — for example, when antihypertensive medications may affect renal function or electrolytes [^115NCHjR].

---

## Additional considerations

Given the patient's age and medical history, consider screening for **secondary hypertension**, as early-onset hypertension (< 40 years) may have an underlying secondary cause. Screen for primary aldosteronism and other secondary causes when clinically indicated [^116tfr3W] [^115pQeUo].

---

## Summary table of recommended laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Frequency** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | Annual | - Hypertension <br/> - Anxiety |

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^113RFeJ4]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Both guidelines recommend obtaining a personal and family history, performing a physical examination that includes measurement of blood pressure, and obtaining basic laboratory testing. Although the specifics of the latter overlap in requiring a fasting blood glucose, blood/serum sodium and potassium, lipid profile, serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinalysis, and ECG, there are discrepancies.

The ACC/AHA guidelines exclusively recommend a complete blood count, serum calcium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, whereas the ESC/ESH guidelines uniquely suggest a hemoglobin/hematocrit, blood uric acid, glycated hemoglobin A1c, liver function tests, urine protein test, or, ideally, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. An echocardiogram, uric acid, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio are optional tests in the ACC/AHA guideline.

In contrast, the ESC/ESH guidelines include echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, cognitive function testing, and brain imaging as additional tests for recognizing hypertension-mediated organ damage. Thus, the assessment of organ damage and its implementation in risk stratification is crucial for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in the ESC/ESH guidelines.

### Epitol [^112o2omK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS), high-resolution HLA-B✱1502 typing is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B✱1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B✱1502 alleles are detected.

Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.

Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur (see PRECAUTIONS, General and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of active liver disease.

Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.

Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.

Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, particularly in pediatric patients, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend eliciting a comprehensive patient history, obtaining mental and behavioral health screening, evaluating social determinants of health, conducting a physical examination, and performing the following diagnostic studies to evaluate for obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years with overweight or obesity:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate for dyslipidemia in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 10 years and older with obesity or overweight. Consider evaluating for lipid abnormalities in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate for abnormal glucose metabolism in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 10 years and older with obesity, or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate for abnormal liver function in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 10 years and older with obesity, or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at age 3 to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

### Does this child with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension? The Rational Clinical Examination systematic review [^111XUK9E]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend that all children and adolescents with hypertension undergo evaluation for secondary causes. Identifying clinical factors associated with secondary hypertension may decrease unnecessary testing for those with primary hypertension.

The objective of the study was to determine the utility of the clinical history, physical examination, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for differentiating primary hypertension from secondary hypertension in children and adolescents (aged ≤ 21 years).

Data sources included the databases of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, searched from inception to January 2022 without language limits. Two authors identified studies describing clinical characteristics in children and adolescents with primary and secondary hypertension.

Data extraction and synthesis involved creating a 2×2 table for each clinical finding in each study. This table included the number of patients with and without the finding who had primary versus secondary hypertension. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool.

Main outcomes and measures utilized random-effects modeling to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Among the results, 3254 unique titles and abstracts were screened, of which 30 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Out of these, 23 (N = 4210 children and adolescents) were used for pooling in the meta-analysis. In the three studies conducted at primary care clinics or school-based screening clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was found to be 9.0%.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining office and/or out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurements in all adults (≥ 18 years) on an opportunistic basis. These measurements should be recorded in their medical file, and patients should be informed of their BP.

### The adult well male examination [^117UHZ5W]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The adult well male examination should incorporate evidence-based guidance towards the promotion of optimal health and well-being, including screening tests shown to improve health outcomes. Nearly one-third of men report not having a primary care physician. The medical history should include substance use, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, diet and exercise habits, and symptoms of depression.

Physical examination should include blood pressure and body mass index screening. Men with sustained blood pressures greater than 135/80 mm Hg should be screened for diabetes mellitus. Lipid screening is warranted in all men 35 years and older, as well as in men aged 20 to 34 who have cardiovascular risk factors. Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm should occur between 65 and 75 years of age in men who have ever smoked. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening men for osteoporosis or skin cancer.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has provisionally recommended against prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer because the harms of testing and overtreatment outweigh potential benefits. Screening for colorectal cancer should begin at 50 years of age in men of average risk and continue until at least 75 years of age. Screening should be performed by high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every year, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years combined with fecal occult blood testing every three years.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for testicular cancer.

### What methods are being used to create an evidence base on the use of laboratory tests to monitor long-term conditions in primary care? A scoping review [^115At98P]. Family Practice (2020). Low credibility.

The second-best approach is to use a quasi-experimental design, comparing the effect of an already implemented policy change, such as the publication of new testing guidelines. Routinely collected primary and secondary care data could then be used to perform an interrupted time series analysis. However, this is problematic because GP practices do not strictly follow the guidelines on testing, and the guidelines often do not give clear recommendations. Alternatively, a new testing strategy could be implemented in one area and compared to a demographically similar region. These approaches may be cheaper but can still be time-consuming because a long follow-up will be needed and are more prone to bias.

Finally, a retrospective comparative cohort study using routinely collected healthcare data may give some insight into the benefits of using 'a lot of tests' versus using 'a minimal number of tests' and 'frequent testing' versus 'applying longer testing intervals'. Because of the large variation in testing between GP practices, irrespective of the demographics of the population they serve, these practices could be divided into those that tend to test often and those that tend to test less. Patients from 'high' and 'low' testing practices could be matched based on demographic factors, co-morbidities, and disease severity. The differences in adverse outcomes specific to the disease and healthcare usage between both groups could be investigated. Although this approach would be much cheaper and time-saving, it will be difficult to investigate patient harms due to over-testing.

### Proleukin [^11132MZa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

The following clinical evaluations are recommended for all patients prior to beginning treatment and then daily during drug administration.

- **Standard hematologic tests**: Including CBC, differential, and platelet counts.
- **Blood chemistries**: Including electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function tests.
- **Chest x-rays**.

Serum creatinine should be ≤ 1.5 mg/dL prior to the initiation of Proleukin treatment. All patients should have baseline pulmonary function tests with arterial blood gases. Adequate pulmonary function should be documented (FEV1 > 2 liters or ≥ 75% of predicted for height and age) prior to initiating therapy.

All patients should be screened with a stress thallium study. Normal ejection fraction and unimpaired wall motion should be documented. If a thallium stress test suggests minor wall motion abnormalities, further testing is suggested to exclude significant coronary artery disease.

Daily monitoring during therapy with Proleukin should include vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration rate), weight, and fluid intake and output. In a patient with a decreased systolic blood pressure, especially less than 90 mm Hg, constant cardiac rhythm monitoring should be conducted. If an abnormal complex or rhythm is seen, an ECG should be performed. Vital signs in these hypotensive patients should be taken hourly.

During treatment, pulmonary function should be monitored on a regular basis by clinical examination, assessment of vital signs, and pulse oximetry. Patients with dyspnea or clinical signs of respiratory impairment should be carefully observed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in terms of laboratory tests, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Serum total calcium**: This test measures the total amount of calcium in the blood.
- **PTH (Parathyroid hormone)**: This test helps to evaluate the function of the parathyroid glands.
- **Creatinine**: This test assesses kidney function, which is important for understanding calcium metabolism.
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: This test evaluates vitamin D levels, crucial for calcium absorption and bone health.

### Undiagnosed hypertension among young adults with regular primary care use [^114q1ovv]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the United States. Blood pressures from young adulthood predict the incidence of future cardiovascular events. Among young adults (18–39 years), approximately 20% of men and 15% of women have diagnosed hypertension, with an expected increase in prevalence due to high obesity rates.

According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), rates of hypertension control have improved in the United States, defined per NHANES as an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 140 mmHg and diastolic pressure of < 90 mmHg among patients with hypertension or self-reported use of blood pressure-lowering medication. However, young adults have consistently low prevalence of hypertension control (38%) compared with middle-aged (40–59 years) and older (≥ 60 years) adults whose prevalence of control is 54% and 53%, respectively. This is concerning because young adults with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for chronic kidney disease and premature strokes, particularly in the presence of diabetes.

Unfortunately, prior studies report low hypertension diagnosis prevalence in young adults meeting criteria for hypertension. Reasons for this disparity are largely unknown. Limited studies identifying barriers to hypertension diagnosis in young adults have focused on lower primary care use and the lack of a regular source of primary care as contributing factors. However, a previous study demonstrated that young adult and middle-aged women (18–49 years) are less likely to be diagnosed with hypertension.

### Vasomotor rhinitis [^111xNwqq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vasomotor rhinitis affects millions of Americans and results in significant symptomatology. Characterized by a combination of symptoms including nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, vasomotor rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion reached after taking a careful history, performing a physical examination, and, in select cases, testing the patient with known allergens. According to a 2002 evidence report published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there is insufficient evidence to reliably differentiate between allergic and nonallergic rhinitis based solely on signs and symptoms. The minimum level of diagnostic testing needed to differentiate between the two types of rhinitis has also not been established. An algorithm is presented based on a targeted history and physical examination with a stepwise approach to management, reflecting the AHRQ evidence report and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals. Specific approaches to the management of rhinitis in children, athletes, pregnant women, and older adults are discussed.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115XCax4]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

- **Importance**: The prevalence of hypertension, both primary and secondary, in children and adolescents in the US ranges from 3% to 4%. Primary hypertension in children older than 13 years has no known cause but is associated with several risk factors, including family history and higher body mass index. Secondary hypertension occurs primarily in younger children and is most commonly caused by genetic disorders, renal disease, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular abnormalities.

- **Objective**: To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, test accuracy, the effectiveness and harms of treatment, and the association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood.

- **Population**: This recommendation statement applies to children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years not known to have hypertension or who are asymptomatic.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence to support screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Fludrocortisone acetate [^111f958w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The physician should advise the patient to report any medical history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease and to report the use of any medicines that might interact adversely with fludrocortisone acetate (see drug interactions). Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice.

The patient's understanding of their steroid-dependent status and increased dosage requirement under widely variable conditions of stress is vital. Advise the patient to carry medical identification indicating their dependence on steroid medication and, if necessary, instruct them to carry an adequate supply of medication for use in emergencies.

Stress to the patient the importance of regular follow-up visits to check their progress and the need to promptly notify the physician of dizziness, severe or continuing headaches, swelling of feet or lower legs, or unusual weight gain. Advise the patient to use the medicine only as directed, to take a missed dose as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next dose, and not to double the next dose. Inform the patient to keep this medication and all drugs out of the reach of children.

Methods

We used the summary statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the U.S. adult population aged at least 20 years (noninstitutionalized) who are not taking antihypertensive medication to simulate a distribution of blood pressure measurements for 1,000,000 individuals. Each simulated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was considered the true SBP for an individual (i.e. their true underlying average blood pressure).

We applied estimates of within-person variability (coefficients of variation) to our population of true SBPs to generate observed SBPs for five independent sets of measurements, representing an annual assessment of blood pressure over five years. Each set of measurements represented:

- **Office measurements**: The average of two separate office measurements, taken in duplicate and repeated six weeks apart, equivalent to office blood pressure measurement.

- **Ambulatory measurements**: One day of ambulatory measurements, using the daytime average from 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.

- **Home measurements**: One week of home measurements, with self-monitoring of blood pressure over seven days, using replicate measurements taken twice daily and discarding the first day's data. This is equivalent to home blood pressure measurement.

We used estimates of the coefficients of variation from the largest primary study, derived from a randomized clinical trial of 163 subjects. Further details of the primary study for the estimates of within-person variability are provided in the S1 Appendix.

We then calculated the cumulative probability that at least one set of blood pressure measurements would be above a threshold (130 mmHg for office/non-office measurements as per…

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^1123DA34]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum potassium: The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, with 4.5 mEq/L often being used as a reference point. If hypokalemia develops, corrective measures should be taken, such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods. Institute these measures cautiously with frequent serum potassium determinations. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq/L require careful observation and treatment. Since serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration, a rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration. If laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium, discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately. It is advisable to discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

	- Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen: Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules may produce elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine levels. This is secondary to a reversible reduction of the glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia), rather than renal toxicity; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be conducted, especially in the elderly.

### Adherence to recommended laboratory testing for hypertension: Insights from a nationwide cohort [^1118UZvv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations, the prevalence of laboratory testing among patients newly diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) in the United States remains unknown. This study evaluated the prevalence of guideline-recommended laboratory testing in patients with newly diagnosed HTN.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX database of adults aged 18 years and older who were newly diagnosed with HTN between 2018 and 2023. Patients were stratified by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The primary outcome was the prevalence of laboratory testing within six months of diagnosis, including complete blood count (CBC), basic/complete metabolic panel (BMP/CMP), lipid profile, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting glucose, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram (ECG).

- **Results**: Among 2,052,702 patients (mean age 59.3 years, 47.3% female), testing completion rates were: CBC (40.8%), BMP/CMP (42.7%), lipid profile (17.0%), TSH (14.8%), fasting glucose (9.6%), urinalysis (21.9%), and ECG (36.3%). Older age (≥ 65 years) was associated with higher completion rates for CBC (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.19–1.20), BMP/CMP (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.16–1.17), TSH (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13–1.15), fasting glucose (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.32–1.35), urinalysis (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.18–1.20), and ECG (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.26–1.28). Female sex was associated with lower rates for CBC (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–0.99), BMP/CMP (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.96), lipid profile (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.89–0.90), ECG (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.96–0.97) but higher for TSH (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.25–2.17) and urinalysis (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.12–1.14).

### Secondary arterial hypertension: When, who, and how to screen [^116WixjN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertension refers to arterial hypertension due to an identifiable cause and affects approximately 5–10% of the general hypertensive population. Because secondary forms are rare and the work-up is time-consuming and expensive, only patients with clinical suspicion should be screened. In recent years, some new aspects have gained importance regarding this screening.

Increasing evidence suggests that 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring plays a central role in the work-up of patients with suspected secondary hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea has been identified as one of the most frequent causes. The introduction of catheter-based renal denervation for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension has dramatically increased the interest and the number of patients evaluated for renal artery stenosis.

We review the clinical clues of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Specific recommendations are given as to the evaluation and treatment of various forms of secondary hypertension. Despite appropriate therapy or even removal of the secondary cause, BP rarely ever returns to normal with long-term follow-up. Such residual hypertension indicates either that some patients with secondary hypertension also have concomitant essential hypertension or that irreversible vascular remodelling has taken place.

Thus, in patients with potentially reversible causes of hypertension, early detection and treatment are important to minimize or prevent irreversible changes in the vasculature and target organs.

For genetically at-risk patients, high-resolution 'HLA-B✱1502 typing' is recommended. The test is considered positive if either one or two HLA-B✱1502 alleles are detected and negative if no such alleles are found.

Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. Patients exhibiting low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts during treatment should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if there is any evidence of significant bone marrow depression.

Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function are essential, especially in patients with a history of liver disease, since liver damage may occur. Carbamazepine should be discontinued based on clinical judgment if there is evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage.

Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp examination, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended because many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.

Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) determinations are recommended due to observed renal dysfunction in patients treated with this agent.

Monitoring of blood levels has enhanced the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants; this may be particularly useful.

To identify individuals recommended for treatment of hypertension, the following variables were measured at the second examination: age, diabetes mellitus, CKD, prior CVD, and 10‐year risk of first CVD event. Diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose classification was measured from self‐reported medication use, an oral glucose tolerance test, or fasting blood samples and defined as: fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, an oral glucose tolerance test 2‐hour post‐load glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%, or self‐reported use of hypoglycemic agents. CKD was defined as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m². Age at examination 2 was self‐reported along with the history of CVD, defined as a prior heart attack, stroke, or heart procedure such as angioplasty, stent, or bypass. Among individuals without a history of CVD, the 10‐year predicted risk of CVD was calculated using the pooled cohort risk equations.

For our primary analyses, of the 16,415 HCHS/SOL participants recruited from 2008 to 2011, we excluded individuals with hypertension (n = 5300) or missing hypertension information (n = 66) at examination 1, and those who did not show up (n = 4792) or were missing hypertension information (n = 86) at examination 2. Our final analytic sample included 6171 participants. For our supplementary analysis using JNC7 to define hypertension, our analytic sample size was larger and included n = 7730 participants free from JNC7 defined hypertension at examination 1.

### Clinical practice guideline: Allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of key areas critical to diagnosis and management.

In Trial 1216, the median baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 104 mL per minute for participants who switched to Odefsey from FTC/RPV/TDF (N = 316), and the mean serum creatinine decreased by 0.02 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48.

In Trial 1160, the median baseline eGFR was 110 mL per minute for participants who switched to Odefsey from EFV/FTC/TDF (N = 438), and the mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48.

Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Trials 1216 and 1160. In Trial 1216, mean BMD increased in participants who switched to Odefsey (1.61% lumbar spine, 1.04% total hip) and remained stable or decreased in participants who remained on FTC/RPV/TDF (0.08% lumbar spine, −0.25% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1.7% of Odefsey participants and 3.0% of FTC/RPV/TDF participants. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 0% of Odefsey participants and 1.2% of FTC/RPV/TDF participants.

In Trial 1160, mean BMD increased in participants who switched to Odefsey (1.65% lumbar spine, 1.28% total hip) and decreased slightly in participants who remained on EFV/FTC/TDF (−0.05% lumbar spine, −0.13% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 2.3% of Odefsey participants and 4.9% of EFV/FTC/TDF participants.

### Management of arterial hypertension: Challenges and opportunities [^113jkGKb]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The asymptomatic nature of hypertension (HTN), combined with its disease burden, underscores the importance of routine blood pressure (BP) screening. According to the World Heart Federation (WHF), HTN screening should begin at age 18 and be repeated every two years, depending on resource availability. Guidelines offer a more pragmatic approach by recommending repeat measurements between one and five years depending on BP. Opportunistic screening for HTN and frequent BP measurement are particularly relevant for high-risk individuals to increase HTN awareness and facilitate early diagnosis and treatment initiation. Additionally, evidence suggests that setting-based screening programs improve the diagnosis and control rates of HTN. It is essential to rule out secondary causes of HTN, such as iatrogenic factors (e.g. corticosteroid use, NSAIDs, vasoconstrictors) and renal, cardiovascular, endocrine, or other diseases.

Different equipment and techniques are used for BP measurement, with device accuracy varying widely, which reduces the efficacy of mass BP screening programs for accurate HTN diagnosis. Particularly in low-resource settings, access to and procurement of validated, accurate BP machines is a significant challenge. In alignment with the World Health Organization (WHO) quality standards for BP machines, having enough calibrated and validated devices should be prioritized to ensure effective screening and diagnosis.

Out-of-office BP measurements, such as self-home BP monitoring (HBPM) or 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), should be encouraged and are the recommended strategies for diagnosis and management.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114kWJK4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The role of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization has been a major barrier. With improved standardization through the NGSP and the IFCC, and new data demonstrating the association between HbA1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes. In making its recommendation, the Committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its preanalytical stability and decreased biological variation. Finally, the clinical convenience of the HbA1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests compared with glucose-based diagnosis, convinced the Committee to recommend HbA1c testing for diagnosis. A value ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic based on the observed relationship with retinopathy. For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay.

The ADA indicates that although either an HbA1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred. The frequency of HbA1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA1c methods should be used to diagnose (or screen for) diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA1c should not be used for diagnosis.

### Utility of routine testing for patients with asymptomatic severe blood pressure elevation in the emergency department [^1147CKDC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the treatment of emergency department (ED) patients with asymptomatic severely elevated blood pressure advise assessment for occult, acute hypertensive target-organ damage. This study determines the prevalence of unanticipated, clinically meaningful test abnormalities in ED patients with asymptomatic severely elevated blood pressure.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study conducted at three urban academic EDs. Consecutive patients with a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or more, or a diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more on two measurements were enrolled if they denied symptoms of hypertensive emergency. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, ECG, CBC count, and chest radiograph were obtained. Treating physicians were interviewed about the indication for each test and whether an abnormal result was anticipated according to clinical findings. When test results became available, physicians were asked whether abnormal findings were clinically meaningful, defined as leading to unanticipated hospitalization, medication modification, or further immediate evaluation. The primary outcome was the prevalence of unanticipated clinically meaningful test abnormalities.

- **Results**: One hundred nine patients with asymptomatic severely elevated blood pressure were enrolled. Unanticipated abnormal test results were noted in 57 (52%) patients. Clinically meaningful unanticipated test abnormalities were found in 7 (6%) patients: basic metabolic panel in 2 (2%), CBC count in 3 (3%), urinalysis in 3 (4%), ECG in 2 (2%), and chest radiograph in 2 (2%).

This study highlights the prevalence and clinical implications of unanticipated test abnormalities in ED patients with asymptomatic severely elevated blood pressure.

### CDC grand rounds: Promoting well-being and independence in older adults [^115PL84o]. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Medicare, the primary healthcare payer for Americans aged ≥ 65 years, has incorporated prevention and screening services into two types of visits: the Welcome to Medicare visit and the Annual Wellness Visit. During the Welcome to Medicare visit, providers conduct a prevention-focused physical examination and review beneficiaries' medical and social history, risk for depression and mood disorders, functional ability, diet, physical activities, and history of tobacco use. A written plan, similar to a checklist, is created to promote ongoing use of clinical preventive services and the discussion of important health topics, such as advance directives.

- **Annual Wellness Visits**: These encompass personalized prevention plan services, including a comprehensive health risk assessment; assessments to detect cognitive impairment, diabetes, hypertension, and missed vaccinations. However, these Medicare prevention and wellness benefits are not as widely used by older Americans as they could be. In 2013, only 6.8% of new Medicare enrollees took advantage of the Welcome to Medicare visit, and in 2014, approximately 16% of Medicare recipients had an Annual Wellness Visit. Only an estimated 7% of Medicare beneficiaries receive all recommended preventive services. Annual Wellness Visit barriers include the relatively long duration of the visit (1 hour), low reimbursement rate for providers, and patient confusion about what is included in the visit. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established improving the rates of the Welcome to Medicare visits as an important Healthy People objective.

### KombiglyzeXR [^113iCtvY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea. The percentage of patients who discontinued due to lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group.

The change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to Week 24 was tested but was not statistically significant. The percentage of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo; significance was not tested.

- **Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin plus an SGLT2 inhibitor**: A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% to ≤ 10.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older, and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m². Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (≥ 1,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead-in treatment period.

### Effects of a structured self-monitoring of blood glucose method on patient self-management behavior and metabolic outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115xByWC]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) on patient self-management behavior and metabolic outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Methods**: From January to June 2009, 30 patients with basic diabetes education were followed for a period of 90 days. To provide assessment of glycemic control and frequency of dysglycemia, patients underwent 3 consecutive days of seven-point SMBG during each month for 3 consecutive months using the ACCU-CHEK 360° View tool. Glucose profiles of the first and third month were used for comparison.

- **Results**: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) improved significantly during the 90-day period in all patients [confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.32–1.64%, p < .05] and those with poor metabolic control (group B; CI 95%, 0.86–2.64%, p < .05). Mean blood glucose (MBG) values decreased significantly in group B (CI 95%, 0.56–24.78 mg/dl, p < .05) and all cases (CI 95%, 1.61–19.73 mg/dl, p < .05). Meanwhile, there was an average decrease of 15.7 mg/dl in fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels in the whole subjects. Mean postprandial blood glucose levels (MPP) decreased by 19.3 and 11.3 mg/dl in group B and in all cases, respectively. However, there were no significant changes in HbA1c, MBG, FBS, and MPP in people with good metabolic control.

- **Conclusion**: A structured SMBG program improves HbA1c, FBS, MPP, and MBG in people with poorly controlled diabetes. This improvement shows the importance of patient self-management behavior on metabolic outcomes in T2DM.

### Differences across the lifespan between females and males in the top 20 causes of disease burden globally: A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^112jc28b]. The Lancet Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

Disaggregating data by sex and gender identity is crucial but constitutes only the initial step in unraveling the roots of health disparities between men, women, and gender-diverse individuals. To effectively tailor responses that accommodate the life experiences and health challenges of all and promote changes, it is imperative to continue innovating in the analysis of secondary health data from a gender perspective. This involves acknowledging gender as a social construct and focusing on the power dynamics and societal norms, which are key drivers of health disparities. This should be done in parallel with in-depth qualitative research to construct health equity strategies that are sensitive to and take into consideration the intricate relationship between gender, health, and other social determinants.

An approach that encompasses several geographical and social contexts is crucial for pinpointing and addressing the particular health needs of diverse populations. For example, our analysis of HIV/AIDS indicated that, aside from sub-Saharan Africa, where females faced a significantly higher burden, males were disproportionately affected in all other regions. This pattern highlights the need for targeted policies and planning to address the specific risk behaviors, social dynamics, and access to health-care services of females and males in various parts of the world. Without granular and intersectional insights, the systemic barriers that sustain health inequities will remain unchallenged.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2017 [^112kgBQJ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Changes in the 2017 adult immunization schedule from the previous year's schedule include new or revised ACIP recommendations for influenza, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccines:

- **Influenza vaccination**: Changes are related to the low effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist, MedImmune) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the United States during the 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 influenza seasons and revised recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine among patients with egg allergy. These changes are reflected in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

	- LAIV should not be used during the 2016–2017 influenza season.
	- Adults with a history of egg allergy who have only hives after exposure to egg should receive age-appropriate inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV).
	- Adults with a history of egg allergy with symptoms other than hives (e.g. angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or emesis, or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention) may receive age-appropriate IIV or RIV. The selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^11414n9t]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Guideline contributors:

To develop the hypertension guidelines, the WHO established four groups:

- **Internal WHO steering group**: This group was responsible for coordinating the guideline development process.
- **Guideline development group (GDG)**: Composed of a diverse group of primary care and subspecialty physicians who were hypertension experts, pharmacists, nurses, health-oriented academics, a patient representative, and policymakers to review the evidence and develop recommendations. The WHO selected the members of the GDG based on relevant expertise while considering appropriate representation by region and sex. An independent methodologist facilitated GDG deliberations.
- **External review group**: Made up of technical experts, representatives of hypertension patient groups, and ministries of health from low-resource countries, this group provided peer review of the guidelines.
- **Independent contracted systematic review group**: This group conducted the overview of reviews and summarized evidence.

The guidelines were developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. In brief, the WHO Steering Group, in collaboration with the Guideline Development Group, developed key questions and rated outcomes to identify those critical for the development of the guidelines. Conflicts of interest were managed in line with the Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics policy, and all members of the GDG were required to fill in the standard WHO Declaration of Interest forms, which were reviewed. An overview of systematic reviews of the evidence was used to build a summary of findings table.

### Homeostasis model assessment: insulin resistance and beta-cell function from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in man [^117QNGwV]. Diabetologia (1985). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" is widely utilized for conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. It is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) offers insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be provided in different units.

- **Fasting glucose can be measured in**:
	- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
	- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

- **Fasting insulin options include**:
	- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
	- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are given in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = (fasting insulin in uIU/mL * fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.

### Recommendations for the allergy management in the primary care [^116pA188]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of patients seeking medical advice for allergic diseases are first seen in a primary care setting. Correct diagnosis with identification of all offending allergens is an absolute prerequisite for appropriate management of allergic disease by the general practitioner. Allergy diagnostic tests recommended for use in primary care are critically reviewed in accordance with the significant workload in a primary care setting. Simplified pathways for recognition and diagnosis of allergic diseases are proposed, and these should be further adapted to local (national) conditions.

### What would be the outcome if the American Diabetes Association recommendations of 2010 had been followed in our practice in 1998–2006 [^115ZTxAt]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In 2010, the American Diabetes Association published recommendations on the population to be screened for dysglycaemia, the diagnostic criteria for intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes using oral glucose tolerance testing and HbA(1c), and the patients eligible for treatment with metformin. We aimed to evaluate the consequences of screening with oral glucose tolerance test or HbA(1c) in an at-risk population.

Among 1,177 overweight or obese consecutive adults without known diabetes who were referred to our department for weight management, we selected 1,157 individuals (83% female; 80% European) fulfilling the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria for dysglycaemia screening.

The mean age was 41.2 ± 13 years, BMI 37.0 ± 7.2 kg/m², fasting plasma glucose 4.9 ± 0.8 mmol/l, and HbA(1c) (turbidimetric immunoassay) 5.7 ± 0.7% (39 mmol/mol). Based on oral glucose tolerance test and HbA(1c), respectively, 76 (6.6%) and 113 (9.8%) patients had diabetes, including 34 sharing both criteria; 307 (26.5%) and 478 (41.3%) had intermediate hyperglycaemia; and 130 (11.2%) and 255 (22.0%) would be treated with metformin. The sensitivity/specificity of HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for the diagnosis of diabetes according to the oral glucose tolerance test were 44.7/92.7%. Diabetes risk scores and UK Prospective Diabetes Study cardiovascular risk score were the highest in the 130 patients having both an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test and HbA(1c) ≥ 5.7%.

In a population at risk for diabetes, the HbA(1c) strategy could lead to diagnosing more individuals at an earlier stage, potentially improving long-term management and outcomes.

### Tasigna [^1149DvLm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Monitoring laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Conduct chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically during treatment. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation, and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of Tasigna therapy, and at least yearly during chronic therapy. If treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) is needed to address lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy, as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.

- **Fluid retention**: In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions, including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients.
