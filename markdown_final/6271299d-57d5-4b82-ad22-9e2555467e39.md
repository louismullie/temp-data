## Question

Continued thumb pain after normal xray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate persistent thumb pain when the X-ray is normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why a normal X-ray does not exclude disease. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by anatomic pain generator. Next, I will outline the focused history and physical examination maneuvers that narrow the field. After that, I need to map imaging choices to the working diagnosis, including when to escalate to MRI or ultrasound. Then, I will consider nonoperative management pathways for the most likely conditions. Finally, I should define surgical indications, special populations, and a concise decision algorithm, while double-checking for pitfalls and ensuring each step is evidence-linked.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise: a normal thumb radiograph does not rule out clinically significant pathology, especially early osteoarthritis, soft-tissue injuries, inflammatory disease, or nerve-related pain, so I should not anchor prematurely on "normal X-ray equals no disease" and must proceed with a structured evaluation of pain generators and function-limiting features [^112b7KC9] [^113WseYJ].

> I will now examine the anatomic pain generators systematically, starting with the thumb base (CMC joint), because early trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis can be radiographically occult yet clinically painful. The lever test outperforms the grind test for reproducing basal joint pain, and MRI can reveal synovitis and bone marrow lesions that correlate with pain even when radiographs are normal, so I should keep CMC OA high on the list and plan targeted provocative testing and advanced imaging if needed [^116iijUx] [^1129VRjx] [^111a3y8q].

> Next, I should review ligamentous injuries, particularly ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury at the MCP joint. A normal X-ray does not exclude a complete UCL tear or a Stener lesion, so I need to check for valgus laxity at the MCP joint and consider ultrasound or MRI if instability is suspected or if pain persists beyond a trial of immobilization, because missing a Stener lesion delays healing and risks chronic instability [^113N6Hno] [^11794R86] [^116pdD3Q].

> Hold on, I should verify the possibility of de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Finkelstein's maneuver and tenderness over the first dorsal compartment support the diagnosis, and ultrasound can confirm tenosynovitis and guide injections, so if the pain is radial-sided at the wrist with thumb motion aggravation, I should prioritize this and avoid conflating it with CMC OA without targeted testing [^117Bp5Vo] [^115CfiNL] [^113WseYJ].

> Let me consider carpal tunnel syndrome as a contributor or mimic. Thenar atrophy, nocturnal paresthesias in the median distribution, and positive Phalen or Tinel favor CTS, and importantly, a negative Tinel and Phalen substantially lowers the need for nerve conduction studies, so I should screen the proximal neuroaxis and not jump straight to hand-only imaging if the sensory exam suggests a nerve disorder [^115wuSvX] [^1161fQB8] [^1124tJA8].

> I need to check for less common but important entities: thumb IP joint osteoarthritis, flexor pulley or volar plate injuries, and even glomus tumor if there is exquisite focal tenderness with cold sensitivity. These can be entirely missed on plain radiographs and may require ultrasound or MRI for detection, so I should match the imaging modality to the suspected pathology rather than defaulting to MRI alone [^113WseYJ] [^111s2gnx] [^113psRvj].

> Now, let me synthesize the history elements that sharpen pretest probabilities: onset and mechanism (trauma, overuse, insidious), pain location and radiation, aggravating factors (pinch, grasp, repetitive thumb use), constitutional symptoms, prior injuries or surgeries, and comorbidities such as diabetes or inflammatory arthritis. I should confirm whether symptoms localize to the CMC versus MCP versus IP or radial wrist, because that anatomic localization will steer both examination and imaging choices [^112b7KC9] [^113WseYJ].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination maneuvers and their diagnostic value: the lever test for CMC OA, grind test with axial compression, MCP valgus stress testing for UCL integrity, Finkelstein's for de Quervain's, and median nerve provocative maneuvers for CTS. I should double-check that I am comparing with the contralateral side and documenting laxity endpoints, because subtle asymmetry and end-feel guide whether instability is partial or complete [^116iijUx] [^117Bp5Vo] [^113N6Hno] [^1124tJA8].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging algorithm so I do not over-order or under-order tests: radiography remains the appropriate first-line study for chronic hand and wrist pain, but if radiographs are normal and suspicion persists for soft-tissue or early OA, ultrasound is preferred for suspected tendon or ligament pathology, whereas MRI is preferred for suspected occult fracture, bone marrow edema, complex joint disease, or when ultrasound is non-diagnostic. I should align the modality to the leading hypothesis to minimize false reassurance from a normal X-ray [^116PvegJ] [^113WseYJ] [^113HXgjb].

> For suspected CMC osteoarthritis with normal radiographs, I should confirm with MRI when pain is refractory and the lever or grind test is positive, because MRI can detect synovitis and subchondral changes that track with pain and may influence treatment selection. If MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, bone scintigraphy can occasionally help in complex postoperative pain scenarios, but that is not first-line for routine CMC OA workup [^1129VRjx] [^111NNrAQ] [^115yS1s9].

> For suspected UCL injury, I should double-check stability under valgus stress and proceed to ultrasound or MRI if a complete tear or Stener lesion is suspected, because dynamic ultrasound can visualize the trapped UCL and MRI delineates the extent of injury. Missing a Stener lesion changes management from conservative to operative due to interposed tissue blocking healing [^11794R86] [^113N6Hno] [^116pdD3Q].

> For de Quervain's, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically and consider ultrasound to verify tenosynovitis and guide injection, as this improves accuracy and outcomes. If symptoms persist despite appropriate conservative care, I should reconsider the diagnosis or coexisting pathology before escalating to surgery [^115CfiNL] [^113WseYJ].

> Let me think about nonoperative management pathways next, and I should ensure I am aligning with evidence: for CMC OA, a rigid CMC-MCP splint improves medium-term pain and function, and hand exercises improve short-term pain and grip strength. Multimodal programs combining education, splinting, and exercise can reduce short-term pain, so I should prioritize these before discussing surgery [^113DCsCL].

> For UCL injury, I should confirm that partial tears without instability are treated with thumb spica immobilization for 4–6 weeks followed by rehabilitation, whereas complete tears or Stener lesions warrant surgical repair. I need to ensure I document the endpoint on valgus stress and any palpable mass suggesting a Stener lesion before deciding on operative referral [^113N6Hno] [^116pdD3Q].

> For de Quervain's, I should offer a corticosteroid injection with thumb spica splinting for 3–4 weeks at first contact, and if symptoms recur or persist, repeat ultrasound-guided injection. If symptoms persist beyond 3–4 months despite these measures, surgical release is reasonable, with counseling on superficial radial nerve injury risk [^115CfiNL].

> For CTS, I should confirm that splinting and activity modification are first-line, and if there is thenar atrophy or persistent disabling symptoms despite 6–12 weeks of conservative care, refer for nerve conduction studies and surgical consultation. I should double-check that I have screened the cervical spine and excluded mimics before labeling refractory cases as CTS [^113e5iRx] [^115wuSvX].

> I should now define surgical indications and options, and I need to ensure I am not overstating indications: for CMC OA, surgery is considered when pain and disability persist despite 3–6 months of optimized conservative therapy. Options include trapeziectomy with or without ligament reconstruction, arthrodesis, or implant arthroplasty, but high-quality evidence does not show clear superiority of one technique over another, so shared decision-making and surgeon expertise should guide choice [^111pF2PF].

> For UCL injury, I should confirm that operative repair is indicated for complete tears, Stener lesions, or chronic instability with functional compromise. Contemporary techniques include suture anchor repair or reconstruction with suture tape augmentation, with excellent short-term outcomes reported, though long-term comparative data remain limited [^116pdD3Q] [^113N6Hno].

> For de Quervain's refractory to nonoperative care, I should discuss open versus endoscopic release, emphasizing similar outcomes but differing complication profiles, and ensure informed consent covers superficial radial nerve injury risk [^115CfiNL].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent? I need to ensure I consider pediatric-specific entities such as trigger thumb, which may not resolve spontaneously and can require release even after prolonged symptoms, and I should remember that normal radiographs are common in many pediatric hand conditions, so clinical diagnosis and functional impact drive management [^112hDZ2M].

> I should also keep in mind postoperative patients with persistent thumb pain after trapeziectomy or basal joint arthroplasty. Impingement between the thumb metacarpal base and residual trapezoid can be a pain source and may require advanced imaging such as bone scintigraphy with SPECT-CT or CT to confirm before revision, so I must not attribute all persistent pain to "expected recovery" without targeted evaluation [^115yS1s9] [^116stRkK].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: start with history and focused exam to localize the pain generator, obtain radiographs as first-line imaging but do not stop if they are normal, escalate to ultrasound or MRI based on the working diagnosis, implement evidence-based conservative care for 3–6 months, and refer for surgical evaluation if pain and disability persist or if instability or nerve compression is present. Throughout, I should double-check for red flags such as infection, tumor, or systemic disease that would alter the pathway [^112b7KC9] [^113WseYJ] [^113DCsCL].

> In summary, persistent thumb pain with a normal X-ray is common and often reflects soft-tissue or early degenerative pathology. A disciplined, hypothesis-driven history and examination, judicious use of ultrasound or MRI, and guideline-concordant conservative care resolve most cases, while surgery is reserved for refractory disease or structural instability. I need to ensure I communicate that a normal radiograph is reassuring but not definitive, and that the next steps are tailored to the specific pain generator identified on clinical grounds [^112b7KC9] [^113WseYJ] [^113DCsCL].

Persistent thumb pain with a normal X-ray is most often due to **soft tissue injuries** (UCL tear, De Quervain's, or CMC arthritis) [^113WseYJ] or **occult bony injury** (scaphoid fracture, CMC instability) [^113dGZNM]. X-rays can miss early arthritis, ligamentous injury, or stress fractures, so **MRI or ultrasound** is indicated if pain persists beyond 2–3 weeks or if instability is suspected [^113WseYJ] [^11794R86]. Management is guided by the diagnosis: UCL injuries need splinting or surgery [^115P3AaM], De Quervain's responds to splinting and injections [^115CfiNL], and CMC arthritis benefits from splinting, injections, or surgery [^113DCsCL] [^111pF2PF]. Persistent pain warrants **advanced imaging** to exclude occult fracture, ligament injury, or arthritis [^113WseYJ].

---

## Common causes of persistent thumb pain with normal X-ray

### Soft tissue injuries

- **Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury**: "Gamekeeper's thumb" from valgus stress; X-rays are often normal unless avulsed [^113N6Hno].
- **De Quervain's tenosynovitis**: First dorsal compartment tendinopathy; X-rays are typically normal [^notfound].
- **Carpometacarpal (CMC) joint arthritis**: Early disease may be radiographically occult; MRI shows synovitis/BMLs correlating with pain [^1129VRjx].

---

### Occult bony injuries

Occult bony injuries include **scaphoid fracture**, which is often radiographically occult early; MRI or CT is needed for diagnosis [^115Ff97Z] [^117RrHRA]. CMC joint instability may also be present, as ligamentous injury can cause instability with normal X-rays; stress views or MRI help detection [^113dGZNM] [^115YzkQR].

---

### Other less common causes

- **Glomus tumor**: Exquisite pain, cold sensitivity, normal X-ray [^111s2gnx].
- **Osteoid osteoma**: Night pain, NSAID-responsive; rare in thumb [^116w5zhU].
- **Inflammatory arthritis**: RA/PSA can present with normal early X-rays [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of X-ray imaging

X-rays are insensitive for **early arthritis, ligament injury, and occult fractures**. Early arthritis may show no radiographic change despite synovitis/BMLs on MRI [^notfound]. Ligamentous injury is not visualized on standard X-rays, and occult fractures (e.g. scaphoid) are frequently missed early [^115Ff97Z].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

1. Detailed history and physical exam**: Localize pain, identify instability, guide imaging** [^112b7KC9]2. MRI**: Persistent pain > 2–3 weeks, suspected ligament/soft tissue injury, occult fracture, early arthritis** [^113WseYJ]3. Ultrasound**: Suspected tendon/ligament injury, dynamic assessment** [^113WseYJ]4. CT**: Suspected occult fracture, complex bony anatomy** [^115yS1s9]5. Bone scan**: Suspected occult fracture, infection, or malignancy [^117RrHRA]

---

## Management strategies

### Soft tissue injuries

- **UCL injury**: Splinting 4–6 weeks; surgery for complete tears or Stener lesion [^115P3AaM].
- **De Quervain's**: Splinting, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injection; surgery if refractory [^115CfiNL].
- **CMC arthritis**: Splinting, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injection; surgery for refractory cases [^113DCsCL].

---

### Occult bony injuries

For occult bony injuries, **scaphoid fracture** is managed with immobilization and MRI/CT if suspicion remains high [^115Ff97Z] [^117RrHRA]. CMC instability is treated with splinting; surgical stabilization if instability persists [^113dGZNM].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis varies by diagnosis and adherence to treatment. Soft tissue injuries generally have a **good prognosis** with appropriate management, whereas occult bony injuries can heal well with timely immobilization or surgery. Persistent pain may indicate **missed diagnosis or inadequate treatment**, warranting further evaluation [^113WseYJ].

---

Persistent thumb pain with a normal X-ray is often due to **soft tissue injury or occult bony injury**. MRI or ultrasound is indicated if pain persists; management is diagnosis-specific, and most patients improve with appropriate care.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^115Z2keH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the digits, also known as trigger finger, is a common tendinopathy in the hand, with a recent reported prevalence of approximately 1%. Normal digit flexion requires the flexor tendons to smoothly glide through a pulley system. This phenomenon is facilitated by the presence of a double synovial sheath within the pulley system. Triggering can occur when inflammation contributes to a size discrepancy of the retinacular sheath and the flexor tendons. The exact etiology of trigger finger is still unknown, although it is thought to be multifactorial. Presenting symptoms can vary. Although many patients will complain of triggering, clicking, or catching of the involved digit, some patients may only complain of pain at the level of the A1 pulley or report the presence of a painful nodule over the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Initial management of trigger finger is often nonsurgical and can involve careful observation alone, activity modification, oral NSAIDs, splinting, corticosteroid injections, or NSAID injections. Some studies advocate for splinting alone as first-line treatment (especially for patients complaining of morning stiffness) with up to 66% of patients needing no further treatment at one year. Corticosteroid injections are also frequently used as first-line nonsurgical therapy due to their ease of use, low risk, and excellent treatment response with complete symptom relief reported in 60% to 90% of patients. Open or percutaneous surgical release is a treatment option for patients with continued symptoms despite nonsurgical treatment or for those with a locked digit.

Multiple studies have attempted to identify risk factors associated with progression to surgery, but the literature has somewhat conflicting conclusions. Some studies identify diabetes mellitus (DM), involvement of multiple digits, a history of other tendinopathies of the upper extremity, trigger thumbs, advanced symptoms, symptom duration greater than 6 months, diffuse type stenosing tenosynovitis, triamcinolone injection (compared with dexamethasone), and younger age to be risk factors for trigger finger recurrence. However, these very same studies have provided contradictory results arguing that symptom severity, duration of symptoms, age, trigger thumbs, and even DM are not risk factors for recurrence.,

Although trigger finger is common, there are limited and inconsistent data exploring why certain patients do not respond to nonsurgical management as well as others. The purpose of this retrospective database study is to investigate factors associated with progression to surgery (indicating continuing or recurrent symptoms) after injection of trigger finger.

### Enigmatic and unusual cases of upper extremity pain: mislabeling as malingerers [^1164BKRi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

With the intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity, there are many possible etiologies of pain. In addition, one must be alert to conditions typically affecting other areas of the body presenting in the hand and upper extremity. To add to the complexity of diagnosis, one must also be aware of potential secondary gains. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments. In this article, we present 4 cases of unusual causes of hand and upper extremity pain.

### What are the most clinically effective nonoperative interventions for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis? An up-to-date systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113DCsCL]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC-1 OA) is a common and debilitating condition, particularly among older adults and women. With the aging population, the prevalence of CMC-1 OA is expected to rise, emphasizing the need to find effective nonoperative strategies. So far, for determining the most effective nonoperative interventions in CMC-1 OA, two network meta-analyses (NMAs) have been published. However, these NMAs were limited to specific intervention types: one comparing multiple splints and the other comparing different intraarticular injections. Therefore, an NMA that compared all nonoperative intervention types is urgently needed.

Questions/Purposes

This study aimed to assess and compare the effectiveness of available nonoperative interventions (both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic) for CMC-1 OA to establish which nonoperative options are more effective than control in terms of (1) pain, (2) function, and (3) grip strength.

Methods

We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) NMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD2021272247) and conducted a comprehensive search across Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL up to March 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating nonoperative interventions for symptomatic CMC-1 OA, excluding inflammatory or posttraumatic arthritis. Studies comparing ≥ 2 interventions or against a control, focusing on pain reduction, functional improvement, and grip strength, were selected. We assessed methodologic quality using the modified Coleman Methodology Score, including only studies scoring > 70. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and evidence quality with Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Of 29 screened studies, 22 (21 RCTs and one quasi-RCT) were included, involving 1631 women and 331 men. We analyzed eight different nonoperative interventions, including splints, hand exercises, injections, and multimodal treatment (≥ 2 nonpharmacologic interventions or nonpharmacologic with a pharmacologic intervention). Six studies had a low risk of bias, eight had a high risk, and the remainder were moderate. We extracted mean and SD scores, and NMA and pairwise analyses were performed at short- (≤ 3 months) and medium-term (> 3 to ≤ 12 months) time points. Standardized mean differences were re-expressed into common units for interpretation, which were the VAS (range 0 to 10) for pain, the DASH test (range to 100) for function, and pounds for grip strength. Clinical recommendations were considered strong if the mean differences exceeded the minimum clinically important difference-1.4 points for VAS, 10 points for DASH, and 14 pounds for grip strength-and were supported by moderate or high confidence in the evidence, as assessed using CINeMA methodology.

Results

Our NMA (based on moderate or high confidence) showed a clinically important reduction in pain at the short-term time point for multimodal treatment and hand exercises versus control (mean difference VAS score -5.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) -7.6 to -3.0] and -5.0 [95% CI -8.5 to -1.5]). At the medium-term time point, only the rigid carpometacarpal-metacarpophalangeal (CMC-MCP) splint was superior to control (mean difference VAS score -1.9 [95% CI -3.1 to -0.6]) and demonstrated clinical importance. For function, only the rigid CMC-MCP splint demonstrated a clinically important improvement at the medium-term time point versus control (mean difference DASH score -11 [95% CI -21 to -1]). Hand exercises resulted in a clinically important improvement in short-term grip strength versus control (mean difference 21 pounds [95% CI 11 to 31]).

Conclusion

This systematic review and NMA show that multimodal treatment and hand exercises reduce short-term pain and improve grip strength, while a rigid CMC-MCP splint enhances medium-term function. Future research should evaluate long-term efficacy.

### Ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the thumb: a comprehensive review [^111skpLD]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Injuries to the thumb ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) are common. Failure to address the ensuing laxity of the metacarpophalangeal joint can lead to compromised grip and pinch, pain, and ultimately osteoarthritis. Instability to valgus stress with the lack of a firm end point is a strong indicator of complete rupture of the UCL. Nonoperative treatment is reserved for incomplete ruptures of the thumb UCL. Operative intervention is typically performed for complete ruptures. Repair of acute ruptures and reconstruction for chronic injuries yield excellent results. Complications are rare and most patients show preservation of motion, key pinch, and grip strength.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^114Gy9ib]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Following exclusion for inflammatory arthritis and absence of hand X-rays, 592 participants were included in the analyses (62% females, mean age 64 years, 90% right handed).

Pattern and occurrence of ROA

The first CMC and the thumb IP were the most frequently affected hand joints (45 and 33%, respectively). The joints of the thumb were the most commonly affected joint group: 70% (n = 412) of participants compared with 58, 33 and 24% for DIPs, PIPs and MCPs, respectively. Bilateral thumb involvement was present in 71% of the participants. There were 314 participants who had first CMC ROA, 61% of whom had bilateral involvement. The Venn diagram (Fig. 1) shows that isolated thumb ROA was more common than ROA in any other isolated joint group.

### The Eaton-Littler ligament reconstruction in thumb carpometacarpal joint instability: outcomes and prognostic factors in 74 patients [^115YzkQR]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of thumb CMC instability primarily relies on clinical presentation and physical examination, in which the stability of the CMC joint is tested by displacing the first metacarpal in a dorsoradial direction and comparing it with the contralateral side. However, in cases of generalized ligamentous laxity, the contralateral side may also exhibit laxity. Radiographic imaging may be used to assess instability and potential degenerative changes.

The initial management of CMC instability is nonsurgical, consisting of exercise therapy and orthotics. Conservative treatment often provides successful results, and only 14% of patients convert to surgery over a median follow-up of 2.8 years. Surgical stabilization is indicated when nonsurgical treatment does not provide sufficient symptom relief. –,

Volar ligament reconstruction, first described by Eaton and Littler, is a well-known approach used for CMC joint stabilization. This technique, often referred to as the Eaton–Littler ligament reconstruction, is a nonanatomic ligament reconstruction that supports the anterior oblique ligament, intermetacarpal ligament, and dorsoradial ligament by passing a partial flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendon graft through a tunnel in the first metacarpal bone. The Eaton–Littler ligament reconstruction has been reported to demonstrate favorable postoperative outcomes, including restored joint stability, adequate function, and improved pain. – However, these results are often based on limited sample sizes using nonstandardized outcome measures, lacking prognostic factors regarding postoperative results. Moreover, current studies often include instability originating from various causes, including both traumatic and nontraumatic causes.– Trauma-induced cartilage damage, although not always immediately apparent, is believed to affect the success of ligament reconstruction procedures. Therefore, a precise evaluation of the outcomes of the Eaton–Littler ligament reconstruction in patients presenting with nontraumatic CMC instability is of use. Furthermore, knowledge of prognostic factors influencing postoperative pain outcomes might prove to be useful in predicting the postoperative result, providing valuable insights for surgeons and patients in making an informed choice for treatment.

This study aimed to assess the prospectively collected outcomes of the Eaton–Littler procedure in patients presenting with nontraumatic thumb CMC instability. The second aim was to identify prognostic factors associated with postoperative pain.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^113e5iRx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — nonsurgical management monitoring and baseline assessment: Clinicians should assess symptom duration, severity of nighttime symptoms, presence of a positive Phalen test, presence of thenar eminence muscle wasting, and prior nonsurgical interventions in individuals with CTS because these factors have been shown to influence results with nonsurgical management. In light of a preponderance of studies reporting fairly high rates of progression to surgery, clinicians must measure progress carefully and refer patients for surgical consultation if improvement with nonsurgical management is not observed.

### Systematic review of ligament reconstruction of traumatic isolated thumb carpometacarpal joint dislocation [^113dGZNM]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The initial management of first CMC dislocations begins with closed reduction and immobilization; this method can be definitive if the joint is stable postreduction. If postreduction films show an unstable or inadequately reduced joint, these injuries should be treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with Kirschner wire fixation to maximize joint stability. However, adequate reduction of these injuries depends on the severity of the injury, and due to the intrinsics of the joint, instability after reduction and/or percutaneous pinning is highly likely. Without this, persistent joint instability after reduction can lead to articular degeneration, chronically impairing normal hand function. Furthermore, an unstable first CMC joint can reduce the function of the thumb, which is used for the most handling maneuvers. Loss of thumb function has been shown to contribute up to a 50% rate of upper extremity impairment. For these reasons, injury to any of the major ligaments contributing to joint stability should be repaired because neglected dislocations, incomplete reductions, or residual instability can result in chronic arthritis and secondary pain.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^1167TF6v]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and sample

The Clinical Assessment Study of the Hand (CAS-HA) is a prospective observational cohort study. All adults aged ≥ 50 years registered with two general practices in North Staffordshire were invited to take part in a postal survey. Respondents who indicated that they had experienced hand pain or hand problems in the past 12 months and consented to further contact were invited to attend a research clinic. This consisted of a clinical interview, physical examination, plain radiographs, anthropometric measurements and a brief self-complete questionnaire. Full details of the study design and methods have been previously reported. The study was approved by the North Staffordshire Local Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent (Project No. 1430).

Data collection

At the research clinics, participants were assessed by trained occupational therapists and physiotherapists. Thumbs were examined for the presence of deformity and enlargement in the thumb IPs, first MCP and the first CMC joints, nodes in the thumb IP joints and muscle wasting of the thenar eminence. The grind test was conducted to determine whether there was pain in the first CMC joint on movement of the joint under compression. Finkelstein's test was performed to examine whether pain was located in the dorsal aspect of the wrist. The Kapandji test assessed participants' ability to oppose the pulp of the thumb to the distal palmar crease. Thumb extension was measured in degrees using a transparent 360° goniometer. Height and weight were measured at the clinic and used to calculate BMI. Reliability of the clinical features and tests has been established.

In self-complete questionnaires, participants were asked to report whether they had experienced thumb pain during activity in the previous month, and to indicate on hand drawings the location of any aches or pains lasting a day or longer in the past month.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: the role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, because of some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, and emphasizes the key points that assist in the differentiation of the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

Collateral ligament injury of the fingers

Compared with collateral ligament injuries involving the thumb, collateral ligament injuries in the lesser digits are uncommon (figure 2)and are a result of partial or complete tears, most often involving the PIP joints due to forced valgus or varus stress at these joints. The UCLs from the third to the fifth fingers are most vulnerable to these injuries. Collateral ligament injury to the MCP joint of the lesser fingers are less common with a predilection to the RCL. Athletes tend to report a history of a 'jammed finger' with pain in the ulnar or radial side of the affected ligament and decreased range of motion. Laxity of the affected joint may be noted in comparison to unaffected joints. Plain films may show associated complications (eg, avulsion fracture, dislocation); However, ultrasonography and MRI are more useful in identifying ligament injuries, with the understanding that MRI accurately detects PIP collateral ligament injuries only 39% of the time.

Collateral ligament injuries can be classified into three grades (table 1) with surgical intervention warranted for grade III injuries or complete collateral ligament rupture. A stable joint with no large fractures or grade I injuries may be treated with splinting and/or buddy taping — taping the injured finger to its adjacent preferably larger finger — for 4–6 weeks. Timely treatment with buddy taping in patients with PIP joint collateral ligament injury appears to have the most influence in preventing poor functional outcomes (eg, limited range of motion) in the long term.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^1147Kmst]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Associations with pain, clinical features and tests

Univariable analysis found statistically significant associations for thumb pain during activity, thumb pain as indicated on a hand diagram, the presence of nodes, deformity or enlargement, muscle wasting of the thenar eminence and a positive grind test with the presence of ROA in the right (Table 1) and the left thumb (data not shown). Associations were found to be equally strong when the presence of ROA was based on involvement of the right first CMC (Table 1) and left first CMC joints (data not shown). Therefore, multivariable analysis was only undertaken to examine the wider definition of ROA in any of the thumb joints.

T1
Univariable and multivariable associations between thumb pain, clinical assessments and the presence of ROA in the thumb (right hand)

Multivariable regression analysis found that right thumb ROA was most strongly associated with a combination of older age; thumb pain during activity; thenar muscle wasting; and the presence of nodes, enlargement or deformity (Table 1). Gender, BMI and all four clinical assessments did not contribute significantly to the model. The amount of explained variance of the final model was 20% (Nagelkerke value = 0.203) and the AUC was 0.72 (95% CI 0.68, 0.76). The model obtained for the left thumb (data not shown) was identical to the model for right, except thumb pain as indicated on a hand diagram was included instead of thumb pain during activity. The amount of explained variance of the final model for the left thumb was 26% (Nagelkerke value = 0.261) and the AUC was 0.77 (95% CI 0.73, 0.81).

### Development of classification criteria for hand osteoarthritis: comparative analyses of persons with and without hand osteoarthritis [^111WRWVK]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The low AUC values for most features suggest that one single feature is not enough to classify hand OA, but the classification criteria should include a set of different features. In the next step, an expert panel will agree upon a set of features that will be tested in a decision analytic software, based on the results from the current study and expert opinions. In these exercises, the 1000Minds software will be used to force experts to choose cases more likely to have OA based on diagnostic features (ie, criteria) and then the software will be used to rank the criteria according to their importance. Based on the results from the current study, which is solely data-driven, and the results from the 1000Minds exercises, which are based on expert opinions, our final criteria set will be determined.

Our analyses focus on the associations with hand OA overall. Since the physicians were not asked whether the patients' complaints were due to interphalangeal OA or thumb base OA specifically, we were not able to look at these phenotypes separately. We are aiming for three separate criteria sets, including hand OA overall, interphalangeal OA and thumb base OA, and the importance of the potential criteria identified in these analyses will, therefore, be studied for the three groups separately in the next steps.

In conclusion, a comparison of patients with hand OA and controls was performed as a first step in the development of classification criteria for hand, finger and thumb base OA. Patients with hand OA and controls demonstrated differences with regard to symptoms, clinical findings, radiographic changes and laboratory tests results with best discrimination observed for the radiographic features. Additional exercises to determine the weight of the different features are needed before the new classification criteria for hand OA can be launched.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^115vVuEW]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

OA is a common joint problem affecting older adults in Western populations. Individuals with hand OA report significant pain and disability in their everyday life and consider hand OA to be a serious condition. It has been suggested that OA in the thumb joints may represent a different syndrome of OA in comparison with other hand joints due to different causal mechanisms. Previous studies of the thumb have only focused on the joints at the base of thumb: the first CMC and the trapezioscaphoid (TS) joints. However, the joints of the thumb (thumb IP, first MCP, first CMC and TS joints) have been found to group together. There is a paucity of research examining ROA of the whole thumb and associations with clinical characteristics of thumb OA, particularly in community-dwelling older adults.

The objectives of this study were to: (i) describe the frequency and patterns of thumb ROA in a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older adults with hand pain or hand problems; and (ii) investigate associations of thumb pain, clinical features and clinical assessment results with the presence of thumb ROA.

### A finding with a diagnosis: I just can' T put my finger on it [^113bR7wm]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old man with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presents with new lesions in the distal phalanx of right fifth finger (painful) and left great toe (painless due to long-standing peripheral neuropathy). Initially a complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy is considered and a dermatological opinion is requested. Enlargement of the lesions over the space of a week leads to plain X-ray, with findings of destruction of the distal phalanx of the involved digits confirming metastatic disease. Palliative radiotherapy is administered to decrease pain and reduce the likelihood of cutaneous and infectious complications. The patient died from systemic disease progression soon after finishing his radiotherapy. Digital metastasis (acrometastasis) should be considered by clinicians in the workup of patients with persistent digital symptoms, particularly in those with known cancer or those at high risk of cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design

We used longitudinal data from the Hand Osteoarthritis in Secondary Care (HOSTAS) study, an ongoing observational cohort of consecutive patients from our outpatient clinic who were included after being diagnosed with primary hand OA by their treating rheumatologist. Patients with secondary hand OA or with hand symptoms due to another cause were excluded. More details on patient recruitment and selection have been published elsewhere.

Participants with baseline and two‐year follow‐up data available were included in this analysis (Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at). This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee at Leiden University Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Demographic characteristics and clinical assessment

Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected with standardized questionnaires, including self‐reported thumb base pain and stiffness during the last month (absent/present), the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN), and self‐reported hand pain on a visual analog scale (VAS; range 0–100 millimeters). Trained research nurses examined the thumb base for pain upon palpation on a semiquantitative scale of 0–3 and bony swelling (absent/present).

### Clinical scaphoid score (CSS) to identify scaphoid fracture with MRI in patients with normal X-ray after a wrist trauma [^115Ff97Z]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to compare a combination of three commonly used tests to identify scaphoid fractures with MRI in patients with normal x-ray after a wrist trauma.

Patients and Methods

This prospective MRI study included patients between 18 years and 49 years, who attended the Emergency Department, Bergen, Norway after sustaining an acute wrist trauma within the previous week. Initial x-rays of the wrist were normal. MRI was done within a median of 1 day after the trauma. The study period lasted 1 year. The patients were examined with three commonly used clinical scaphoid tests; tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox with the wrist in ulnar deviation (3 points), tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (2 points) and pain upon longitudinal compression of the thumb (1 point). The clinical scaphoid score (CSS) is a sum of these points, which was compared with MRI verified fracture of the scaphoid.

Results

We included 154 patients with wrist sprain and normal x-rays; 13 had occult scaphoid fracture. A CSS of 4 or more was the only statistically significant 'cut-off' value to identify occult scaphoid fractures (p < 0.05). Diagnostic sensitivity increased with more experienced Emergency Department doctors.

Conclusions

If a patient with wrist pain after injury and normal x-ray has a CSS ≥ 4 (pain in the anatomical snuffbox in addition to pain at scaphoid tubercle or longitudinal compression or both) we recommend MRI. A CSS < 4 has a negative predictive value of 96%, which makes scaphoid fracture unlikely.

### Long-term results using a treatment algorithm for chronic sesamoiditis of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint [^114pVMVc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report a series of 18 patients with chronic sesamoiditis of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb treated in the period from 1997 to 2002. We describe a diagnostic clinical test (sesamoid provocation test [SPT]) and present the long-term results of the senior author's treatment algorithm.

Methods

The study included 20 thumbs in 18 patients (8 men and 10 women) with an average age of 36 years. The mean duration of symptoms at initial presentation was 6 months. The dominant thumb was symptomatic in 80% of patients, and 30% of patients gave history of prior trauma. The diagnosis was made clinically and aided by the SPT. Radiographs were normal in 65% of thumbs. The treatment algorithm consisted of steroid injection(s) into the subsesamoid joint. Sesamoidectomy was reserved for patients who were symptomatic (visual analog pain score ≥ 3) after 2 steroid injections. The patients were contacted by telephone in 2010 for an assessment of long-term results.

Results

Eight thumbs improved with a single steroid injection whereas 5 thumbs required a second steroid injection. Of the 6 thumbs that underwent sesamoidectomy, 1 required secondary surgery for recurrent symptoms. At long-term follow-up (average, 9 y), 1 patient, who had declined sesamoidectomy, continued to have persistent pain affecting thumb function.

Conclusions

Previous reports have suggested that nonoperative treatment is not effective in the management of chronic sesamoiditis. We found that steroid injections were an acceptable treatment modality with long-lasting results. Failures can be successfully treated with sesamoidectomy.

### Two-year changes in magnetic resonance imaging features and pain in thumb base osteoarthritis [^1129VRjx]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to providing more insight in the course and prognosis of thumb base OA, this study suggests inflammation in the thumb base could be explored as a potential treatment target. This may appear to contrast negative findings from clinical trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in the thumb base, though the lack of trials with positive outcomes could also be related to the inclusion of patients without inflammation. Therefore, trials selecting patients based on the presence of thumb base inflammation, and not primarily radiographic damage as has been done before, may generate different results. Indeed, a recently published trial of prednisolone in interphalangeal OA that only included patients with objectifiable inflammation of at least one interphalangeal joint showed significant and clinically meaningful results, whereas previous trials of glucocorticoids in hand OA without confirmed inflammation at baseline were inconclusive.

In conclusion, over the course of 2 years, thumb base pain fluctuated. Osteoarthritic features on MRI of the thumb base changed in a minority of patients with hand OA, in whom structural features mostly deteriorated and in whom inflammatory features changed in either direction. Changes in synovitis and BMLs were associated with changes in pain, mainly in patients with radiographic damage. Therefore, while radiographic damage may be the main determinant of pain in thumb base OA, the present study shows that a change in inflammatory features in the thumb base may still have a relevant effect on pain.

### Failed thumb carpometacarpal arthroplasty: common etiologies and surgical options for revision [^116stRkK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Carpometacarpal (CMC) arthroplasty surgery, although modifications have occurred over time, continues to be commonly performed and has provided patients with their desired pain relief and return of function. The complications of primary surgery, although relatively rare, can present in various clinical ways. An understanding of the underlying anatomy, pathology of coexisting conditions, and specific techniques used in the primary surgery is required to make the best recommendation for a patient with residual pain following primary CMC arthroplasty. The purpose of this review is to provide insights into the history of CMC arthroplasty and reasons for failure and to offer an algorithmic treatment approach for the clinical problem of persistent postoperative symptoms.

### A suspected malignancy in osteolytic bone tumour of the thumb [^1134zyfi]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old male patient was referred to our institution owing to a painful and gradually developing lesion of the thumb with suspicious malignancy. The patient was suffering from a swollen, red, tender left thumb for 3 months. An old scar at the finger pulp could be traced from an old minor trauma. The x-ray revealed an osteolytic lesion in the terminal phalanx of the non-dominant hand that raised concerns of malignancy. Additional investigations such as ultrasound, CT-scan and MRI have been performed to get better insight to the lesion. After performing a biopsy, no malignant cells were found. Owing to the local destroying effect of the lesion and the clinical signs of the patient, the lesion was excised in total. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the tumour as a rare intraosseous epidermoid cyst. A bone graft after resection was not needed. The postoperative follow-up of the patient was uneventful.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hand and wrist pain: 2023 update [^112b7KC9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic hand and wrist pain is a common presenting complaint. The intricate anatomy results in a variety of pain generators-multiple bones, articular cartilage, intrinsic ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage complex, joint capsules and synovium, tendons and tendon sheaths, muscles, and nerves-in a compact space. The need for imaging and the choice of the appropriate imaging modality are best determined by the patient's presentation, physical examination, and the clinician's working differential diagnosis. Radiography is usually appropriate as the initial imaging study in the evaluation of chronic hand or wrist pain. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Thumb metacarpal-trapezoid impingement as an etiology of pain after trapeziectomy and basal joint soft tissue arthroplasty: a case series [^115yS1s9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report a poorly described etiology for pain after trapeziectomy and soft tissue basal joint arthroplasty, diagnosed with the aid of nuclear imaging.

Methods

Five patients (4 women and 1 man), average age 62 years (range, 59–65 years) presented with pain an average of 7 months (range, 2–11 months) after basal joint arthroplasty. The dominant hand was involved in all cases. Advanced imaging including 25 mCi 99m Tc methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography (CT) showed intense tracer uptake between the base of the thumb metacarpal and residual trapezoid. Computed tomography scans confirmed abutment between these bones. The symptoms were attributed to this finding, and revision surgery consisting of excision of the trapezoid and arthrodesis of the index and middle finger carpometacarpal joints was performed.

Results

Mean follow-up was 40 months (range, 12–60 months). Grip strength improved from a mean of 10.5 to 23 kg, and lateral pinch strength improved from a mean of 3 to 6.75 kg. Radiographic fusion of the index finger metacarpal to capitate was confirmed in 4 of 5 patients; it was indeterminate in one patient who was completely pain-free. Radiographic fusion of long finger carpometacarpal joints was indeterminate in 3 patients. Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation pain scores improved from 35 to 6, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation function scores from 78 to 14, and Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores from 37 to 18.

Conclusions

Impingement between the base of the thumb metacarpal and remaining trapezoid should be considered a potential source of pain after trapeziectomy and soft tissue arthroplasty. Advanced imaging (bone scintigraphy and single-photon emission CT and standard CT) are helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

### Development of classification criteria for hand osteoarthritis: comparative analyses of persons with and without hand osteoarthritis [^1173UHNd]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is currently being classified by the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which have important shortcomings that might prevent much-needed insight in hand OA pathogenesis and testing of treatments in clinical trials. Importantly, the criteria are based on clinical examination parameters often with poor reliability without the possibility to classify hand OA based on radiographs. Moreover, they define OA as present almost exclusively based on a combination of affected joints in the 2nd and 3rd fingers and the thumb base. Since the control group in the development of the criteria mainly consisted of persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the criteria are not well suited to classify hand OA in a wider population with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Mainly severe hand OA will be classified by the ACR criteria making them insensitive in the general population. Lastly, all hand OA phenotypes are lumped together, without taking into consideration that different phenotypes could have different pathogenesis or treatment.

Research on the natural disease course and development of effective treatment options is seriously hampered by the lack of good classification criteria. For example, comparisons of disease incidence and prevalence are difficult. Since different definitions of hand OA are used in clinical trials rather than the ACR criteria, it is challenging to perform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Members of the EULAR taskforce for evidence-based recommendations on hand OA diagnosis ranked the development of new classification criteria as a top research priority.

Our aim is to identify features that are associated with hand OA and that can discriminate hand OA and controls in a population with hand complaints as a first step to develop new classification criteria for hand OA overall and different hand OA phenotypes.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115dAD7v]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — history and examination findings emphasize paresthesia distribution and specific provocative tests. Paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and the distribution of paresthesia in the hand is also considered more valid than the distribution of paresthesia in the forearm. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to vocalize the paresthesia to a distinct region. Dermatomal mapping notes that paresthesia of the thumb or index finger is attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index) to the C7 dermatome, and the little finger to the C8 dermatome. In a best evidence review, a positive Spurling's, traction/neck distraction, and Valsalva can be used to establish a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, and the existing literature appears to indicate high specificity, low sensitivity, and good to fair interexaminer reliability. For detection of radiculopathy, the presence of numbness has varied significantly from 24% to 48%, and 60% to as high as 86%; numbness is most often seen in the C6 and C7 dermatomes, and the predictive validity of numbness was calculated to be 0.7. Regarding imaging, in patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease; however, plain radiography was not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain, and no systematic reviews were identified which examined the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic imaging in those with neck pain.

### Tendon and ligament injuries of the finger and thumb in athletes: a narrative review [^113psRvj]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Flexor pulley injuries

The pulley system of the finger is responsible for maintaining close proximity of the flexor tendon to the phalanges, which is necessary for the proper function of the finger flexors. This system is composed from annular (A1–A5) and cruciate (C1–C4) pulleys (figure 2). Rock climbing and bouldering require a unique gripping motion (ie, 'crimp-grip position') that directs significant amount of force across the pulley systems increasing risk of injury (figure 2). However, martial artists practising Kendoand baseball pitchersmay also develop pulley injuries with A1 and A4 pulleys being most vulnerable, respectively. Patients typically present with local tenderness and oedema over the injured pulley(s) in the volar side. Physical exam may reveal pain or discomfort with resisted flexion and gripping motion of the affected finger. Plain X-rays are recommended to rule out fractures. However, an MRI is the gold standard to identify and assess the severity of these injuries (strain vs complete rupture). Due to ease of access and relatively low cost, ultrasound may be an alternative method to MRI in identifying pulley injuries if the operator is skilled enough.

The Schöffl classification systemis useful in determining injury severity of flexor pulley injuries to help guide management decisions (figure 2). Grade I–III injuries are often treated conservatively with rest, physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and different taping methods (eg, H-taping) or a protective splint (eg, external pulley ring splint). For these injuries, initial immobilisation is usually necessary except for grade I injuries. Grade IV injuries often require operative intervention (repair or reconstruction), however, clinically apparent bowstringing or longer than anticipated healing time in grade III injuries may also require operative treatment.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".

### Osteoid osteoma of the thumb: a case report [^114qSQQE]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Osteoid osteoma is a rare occurrence in the hand, and only a small percentage affects the thumb and distal phalanges. An 18-year-old right-hand-dominant man presented to our office with an approximately 1-year history of left thumb pain without any history of trauma. He had seen several doctors previously and undergone multiple diagnostic tests with no definitive diagnosis. Plain radiographs and computed tomography at our institution were consistent with the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. The patient was treated with surgical excision of the lesion without bone grafting. The diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was confirmed by pathology. At 6 months follow-up, the patient showed complete resolution of pain and full restoration of hand function. This case demonstrates that osteoid osteoma should not be forgotten as a differential diagnosis in patients with finger pain, especially in individuals who have not yet or just recently have reached skeletal maturity.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^117FxaZT]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Radiographs

Posterior–anterior radiographs of the hands and wrists were taken according to a standardized protocol. A single reader (M.M.) graded 16 joints in each hand: DIPs (n = 4), PIPs (n = 4), MCPs (n = 5), thumb IP, first CMC and TS joints for ROA using the Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) grading system. ROA for a joint was defined as the presence of K&L ≥ 2, and thumb ROA was defined as the presence of K&L ≥ 2 in one or more joints of the thumb (thumb IP, first MCP, first CMC and TS). Inter-observer reliability was found to be very good (unweighted mean κ 0.79, mean percentage agreement 95%).

Data analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 14.0 SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and Confidence Interval analysis (version 2.0.0 Statistics with Confidence, second edition, BMJ Books, 2000). The number and percentage of participants with ROA in each joint and joint group were calculated. Combinations of involvement of the thumb joints with other joint groups were examined using a Venn diagram.

Univariable analysis was carried out to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of associations of the presence of ROA in any thumb joint with variables of thumb pain, clinical features and clinical assessment results. Thumb extension was measured as a continuous variable but was dichotomized for analysis using the median value in both thumbs (≥ 40° and < 40°). The analysis was repeated to compare those with and without ROA in the first CMC joint.

Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed using block-entered data: (i) demographic data (age, gender and BMI); (ii) thumb pain (during activity and as indicated on a hand diagram); (iii) clinical features (thenar muscle wasting, presence of nodes, enlargement or deformity in the thumb); and (iv) clinical assessments (grind test, Finkelstein's test, Kapandji index and thumb extension). Only items with a significance of < 0.1 were kept in the models. The amount of explained variance of the models was estimated by calculating Nagelkerke values and the discriminatory ability of the models was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating curves (AUCs).

### Long-term outcome of nonsurgically treated patients with wrist pain and a normal arthrogram [^112tsgxJ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A series of 52 patients who had been treated nonsurgically for wrist pain after an inconclusive physical examination, normal standard radiographs, and a negative radiocarpal arthrogram result were surveyed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) instruments after a minimum of 2 years (average, 6.1 years). Forty-two patients (81%) responded to the survey. Average duration of symptoms before the initial evaluation was 13 months. At follow-up evaluation, mean SF-12 score was 50 (national mean, 50). Mean DASH score was 17 compared with 2 for a control group of 60 people. Sixty-four percent of patients reported improvement, 19% were unchanged, and 17% were worse since the initial evaluation. Two patients were receiving disability benefits. Duration of symptoms > 12 months was associated with a worse outcome. These results show that patients with wrist pain but without a diagnosis by these evaluation methods often have persistent symptoms after nonsurgical treatment, but the symptoms are usually mild and improve.

### Evaluation of physical examination tests for thumb basal joint osteoarthritis [^116iijUx]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We compare the ability of 3 diagnostic tests to reproduce the pain of basilar joint arthritis (BJA): the grind test, the lever test (grasping the first metacarpal just distal to the basal joint and shucking back and forth in radial and ulnar directions), and the metacarpophalangeal extension test.

Methods

Sixty-two patients with thumb BJA were enrolled. The 3 tests were performed in a random order on both hands of each patient. Prior to testing, patients reported their typical pain level and subsequently rated their pain after each test on a 0 to 10 scale, also specifying the extent to which the test reproduced their thumb pain (fully, partially, not at all). All patients had radiographs that displayed basal joint arthritis. A test was defined as positive for BJA if pain produced was greater than 0. Sensitivity and specificity for each test were calculated using the patients' history of pain localized to the basal joint and BJA diagnosis on radiographs as the gold standard.

Results

The lever test produced the greatest level of pain and best reproduced the presenting pain. The lever test also had the highest sensitivity, high specificity, and the lowest false-negative rate. The grind test had the lowest sensitivity, highest specificity, and highest false-negative rate.

Conclusions

The lever test was the diagnostic test that best reproduced the pain caused by thumb basal joint osteoarthritis. We recommend using the lever physical examination test when evaluating the patient with suspected basal joint osteoarthritis. The often-quoted grind test is of limited diagnostic value.

### Abstracts of the 35th meeting of the German society for pediatric and adolescents rheumatology (gesellschaft für kinder-und jugendrheumatology (GKJR) [^116iu4jF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Description: A 14-year-old female presented with chronic, bilateral, activity-related knee pain persisting for over a year. Symptoms lacked inflammatory features such as swelling, warmth or morning stiffness. Initial sonography was unremarkable and MRI findings indicated tibial and femoral bone marrow edema, consistent with a stress reaction. Despite extensive workup, no rheumatologic diagnosis was established.

Over time, the patient experienced pain and swelling in her hand after minor trauma. An external X-ray identified a cystic lesion, prompting re-evaluation by a pediatric radiologist. Imaging revealed severe osteopenia, subperiosteal bone resorption and acroosteolysis, hallmark findings of hyperparathyroidism. MRI findings confirmed the presence of a brown tumor. Laboratory tests supported the diagnosis, showing elevated calcium (3.6 mmol/L; normal 2.2–2.6), low phosphate (0.8 mmol/L; normal 1.0–1.5), markedly elevated PTH (111 pmol/L; normal 1.6–6.9), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (17 µkat/L; normal 1.1–6.5). Neck ultrasound identified a parathyroid adenoma, which was histologically confirmed after surgical excision. Postoperatively, serum calcium normalized and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improved skeletal mineralization. Symptoms, including the brown tumor, resolved.

Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering metabolic disorders like primary hyperparathyroidism in the differential diagnosis of unexplained bone and joint pain. Early detection through basic laboratory tests such as serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase can significantly expedite diagnosis and treatment. Revisiting imaging studies with a focus on metabolic patterns is crucial for recognizing rare conditions. Incorporating routine metabolic assessments into the diagnostic workup for persistent bone pain is a simple yet effective strategy to prevent diagnostic delays and optimize outcomes in conditions such as osteitis fibrosa cystica.

### Braces and splints for common musculoskeletal conditions [^112TwibL]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Braces and splints can immobilize and protect joints, reduce pain, decrease swelling, and facilitate healing of acute injuries. They are also used for injury prevention and chronic pain reduction, and to alter the function of a joint. The medial unloading (valgus) knee brace is an option for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis, but evidence of long-term benefit is limited. The patellar stabilizing brace helps maintain proper patellar alignment but has mixed results in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome. The patellar tendon strap is effective in treating pain from patellar tendinopathy. The knee immobilizing splint is used after surgery to prevent reinjury and for acute or presurgical management of quadriceps rupture, patellar tendon rupture, medial collateral ligament rupture, patellar fracture or dislocation, and other acute traumatic knee injuries. Use of a functional ankle brace is more effective than immobilization or a compression wrap in terms of functional outcomes after an acute ankle sprain and prevention of future ankle sprains. The thumb spica splint is effective for the treatment of thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis and de Quervain tenosynovitis, and may be used for patients with suspected scaphoid fractures. A wrist splint has short-term effectiveness in treating symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome but may not be more effective than other conservative therapies.

### Maintained physical activity and physiotherapy in the management of distal arm pain: a randomised controlled trial [^113hjyhs]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Between February 2012 and February 2014, 1663 patients were invited to pretrial screening, of whom 680 were assessed for eligibility and 538 were randomised: 178 to advice to remain active, 182 to advice to rest and 178 advice to immediate physiotherapy; figure 1). The mean (SD) age of participants was 49 (14) years and 46% were male. Twenty-nine per cent of participants reported pain/disability in their elbow, 34% in their wrist/hand and 37% in both. According to the Southampton Examination Schedule, 67% had a specific disorder, while 33% had non-specific symptoms. Lateral epicondylitis, tenosynovitis and thumb osteoarthritis made up nearly two-thirds of the specific diagnoses recorded (23%, 21%, and 17%, respectively). Table 1 shows the demographic and baseline characteristics of the randomised participants, by treatment group.

Ligament injuries

Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the thumb

Acute ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury of the thumb is classically seen in skiers (ie, 'skier's thumb' or 'goalkeeper's thumb') with a history of breaking a fall while holding the ski pole handles. This results in radial stress to the UCL from forced extreme abduction and extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb (figure 4). However, any valgus stress to the thumb could potentially injure the UCL, including throwing sports (eg, javelin) or stick sports (eg, hockey, lacrosse). Also in baseball, sliding head first with an outstretched hand with an abducted thumbs towards a base is a common mechanism for injuring the UCL.

Figure 4
Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the thumb. (A) Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) may be damaged from forced abduction (red arrow). (B) Stener lesions occur when the UCL is displaced outside the adductor aponeurosis. This leads to UCL entrapment and reduced likelihood of healing with conservative management. (C) To determine the degree of laxity, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is stabilised while applying a valgus stress.

Patients typically present with pain and swelling in the UCL or at the base of the thumb with decreased range of motion of the MCP of thumb. Interestingly, the site of a thumb UCL tear or rupture tends to occur at the distal insertion of proximal phalanx. In contrast, the rupture site for thumb radial collateral ligament (RCL) injuries often occurs more proximally at the insertion of the metacarpal head. A firm mass palpated around the ulnar border of the metacarpal head suggests avulsion of the UCL distally resulting in a Stener lesion (figure 4), which occurs in greater than 60% of cases. Ultrasonography is helpful in detecting UCL injury of the thumb and the Stener lesion. Moreover, joint laxity may also be assessed with a dynamic ultrasound evaluation; plain films are often normal unless a concurrent avulsion fracture is present, which occurs in a third of cases. Care needs to be taken when abducting the thumb during examination to prevent further injuring the patient by inducing a Stener lesion.

### Isolated first carpometacarpal joint dislocation managed with closed reduction and splinting [^117FRvLZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 56-year-old man, right-hand-dominant office worker, complained of pain and swelling at the base of his right thumb after using his hand to press onto the front passenger seat during an emergency brake. X-ray showed a dorsal dislocation of the first carpometacarpal joint of his right hand. Closed reduction of the joint was performed. As there were no clinical signs of instability post-reduction and X-ray confirmed that the joint was congruent, the joint was immobilised in a thumb spica splint for 6 weeks. His pain subsided and the range of motion of his first carpometacarpal joint was full at 9 weeks post-injury. Two years after the injury, he was asymptomatic and X-ray revealed normal joint anatomy with no obvious subluxation or osteoarthritic change. For patients with first carpometacarpal joint dislocations, non-operative management with splinting is a good option if the joint is stable post-reduction.

### Physical examination of the wrist: useful provocative maneuvers [^1142P4Dk]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic wrist pain resulting from partial interosseous ligament injury remains a diagnostic dilemma for many hand and orthopedic surgeons. Overuse of costly diagnostic studies including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scans, and bone scans can be further frustrating to the clinician because of their inconsistent specificity and reliability in these cases. Physical diagnosis is an effective (and underused) means of establishing a working diagnosis of partial ligament injury to the wrist. Carefully performed provocative maneuvers can be used by the clinician to reproduce the precise character of a patient's problem, reliably establish a working diagnosis, and initiate a plan of treatment. Using precise physical examination techniques, the examiner introduces energy into the wrist in a manner that puts load on specific support ligaments of the carpus, leading to an accurate diagnosis. This article provides a broad spectrum of physical diagnostic tools to help the surgeon develop a working diagnosis of partial wrist ligament injuries in the face of chronic wrist pain and normal x-rays.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^114Q4RMC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

### Stickler syndrome-lessons from a national cohort [^112KBMB9]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Case study 10

The proband was referred aged three years with congenital high myopia, having undergone cleft palate repair at age one. A diagnosis of type 1 Stickler syndrome was made on the basis of vitreous phenotype and confirmed on molecular genetic analysis. Three-hundred-sixty degree prophylactic retinopexy was applied to both eyes and she progressed well in normal schooling and partook in various sporting activities including dancing and swimming. She developed right hip pain whilst undergoing Duke of Edinburgh Award training. Her examination demonstrated pes planus bilaterally with pain around her hip consistent with a soft tissue Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome. No X-ray was requested, given her age and likely diagnosis. She was advised to take analgesia (paracetamol and topical ibuprofen gel as necessary), supplied with tailored exercises, use over-the-counter medial arch insoles and continue with exercise. She completed her Award, cut back on weight-bearing activities and her pain settled.

Key learning points

Joint hypermobility is more frequent in the Stickler Syndrome and is associated with pes planus and soft tissue pain, particularly around the ankle and knee. The wrist, base of thumb, spine and hip can also be affected. Dislocations can be associated with chronic pain.
The growing skeleton of the child affords an opportunity to correct disadvantageous biomechanics such as pes planus with education, orthotics and exercises.
Advice regarding sports should weigh up the social and health advantages with the risk of joint and ocular injury. Each case should be individually assessed. Usually, the advantages of any activity outweigh the risks.

### Diagnosis and management of scaphoid fractures [^117RrHRA]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Scaphoid fracture is a common injury encountered in family medicine. To avoid missing this diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and a thorough history and physical examination are necessary, because early imaging often is unrevealing. Anatomic snuffbox tenderness is a highly sensitive test for scaphoid fracture, whereas scaphoid compression pain and tenderness of the scaphoid tubercle tend to be more specific. Initial radiographs in patients suspected of having a scaphoid fracture should include anteroposterior, lateral, oblique, and scaphoid wrist views. Magnetic resonance imaging or bone scintigraphy may be useful if the diagnosis remains unclear after an initial period of immobilization. Nondisplaced distal fractures generally heal well with a well-molded short arm cast. Although inclusion of the thumb is the standard of care, it may not be necessary. Nondisplaced proximal, medial, and displaced fractures warrant referral to an orthopedic subspecialist.

### Two-year changes in magnetic resonance imaging features and pain in thumb base osteoarthritis [^111NNrAQ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In a previous cross‐sectional analysis of this hand OA cohort, we showed that radiographic damage was a more important determinant of pain in the thumb base than synovitis or BMLs were, which contrasts findings of studies in interphalangeal OA. The same study demonstrated that the combined presence of inflammation and structural damage in the thumb base had an additive effect on pain. We now show that a change in synovitis and BMLs was associated with a change in pain, even after adjustment for radiographic damage. Subsequently, stratified analyses revealed that this association was strongest in joints where radiographic damage was present at baseline. Taking the results of these two studies together, radiographic damage seems to be the most important feature associated with pain in thumb base OA cross‐sectionally, though a change in inflammatory features could still have a relevant effect on the course of pain.

The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritic joint pain was already discussed in an excellent seminar published over a decade ago. Recently, a review by different authors corroborated the proposed mechanisms, though definite proof is yet to be found. Peripheral nociceptive pain could arise from ongoing tissue injury or inflammation of innervated tissues, such as the subchondral bone, periosteum, and synovium. The cartilage itself is aneural but can still be involved by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that can sensitize pain pathways at the peripheral, spinal, or cortical compartment. Pain sensitization might explain why associations between decreased MRI features and decreased pain are smaller compared to increased MRI features and increased pain, as pathways can still remain sensitized after the inflammation subsides.

The relatively low number of thumb base joints with radiographic progression after two‐year follow‐up is in line with results from a previous study in 172 patients with hand OA, of whom only 8 (4.7%) had osteophyte progression and even less (n = 5, 2.9%) had JSN progression in the CMC1 joints after two years. After 6‐year follow‐up, only a small proportion of CMC1 and STT joints showed radiographic osteophyte progression (16.5% and 1.5%) or JSN progression (10.5% and 6.2%). Although radiographic progression did not appear to affect pain levels in this study, the low number of joints showing radiographic progression prevents the ability to form strong conclusions about these findings, and a longer follow‐up period may be needed to investigate this relationship.

### Hand joints without radiographic osteoarthritis maintain their joint space width over 4 years despite what's happening elsewhere in the hand [^113YVNu9]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to determine whether hand OA is characterized by systemic cartilage loss by assessing if radiographically normal joints had greater joint space width (JSW) loss over 4years in hands with incident or prevalent OA elsewhere in the hand compared with hands without OA.

Methods

We used semi-automated software to measure JSW in the distal and proximal IP joints of 3368 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative who had baseline and 48-month hand radiographs. A reader scored 16 hand joints (including the thumb base) for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade. A joint had OA if scored as KL ≥ 2. We identified three groups based on longitudinal hand OA status: no hand OA (KL < 2 in all 16 joints) at the baseline and 48-month visits, incident hand OA (KL < 2 in all 16 joints at baseline and then one or more joints with KL ≥ 2 at 48months) and prevalent hand OA (one or more joints with KL ≥ 2 at baseline and 48months). We then assessed if JSW in radiographically normal joints (KL 0) differed across these three groups. We calculated unpooled effect sizes to help interpret the differences between groups.

Results

We observed small differences in JSW loss that are unlikely to be clinically important in radiographically normal joints between those without hand OA (n = 1054) and those with incident (n = 102) or prevalent hand OA (n = 2212) (effect size range -0.01–0.24). These findings were robust when examining JSW loss dichotomized based on meaningful change and in other secondary analyses.

Conclusions

Hand OA is not a systemic disease of cartilage.

Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint injuries of the fingers are frequent among athletes and can markedly affect an athlete's ability to perform at a high level. Despite this, MCP finger injuries in athletes are not frequently discussed, particularly in comparison with MCP joint injuries of the thumb, and remain unrecognized and undertreated injuries in this cohort. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of these injuries begins with an understanding of all the potential diagnoses. The purpose of this study was to review the pertinent anatomy and differential diagnoses for MCP joint injuries in athletes, including the evaluation and management to allow for safe and early return to play.

### Dorsal subluxation of the first metacarpal during thumb flexion is an indicator of carpometacarpal osteoarthritis progression [^113mxkcr]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Measurable changes in patients with progression of thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) include joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subluxation, and adjacent-tissue changes. Subluxation, an indication of mechanical instability, is postulated as an early biomechanical indicator of progressing CMC OA. Various radiographic views and hand postures have been proposed to best assess CMC subluxation, but 3D measurements derived from CT images serve as the optimal metric. However, we do not know which thumb pose yields subluxation that most indicates OA progression.

Questions/Purposes

Using osteophyte volume as a quantitative measure of OA progression, we asked: (1) Does dorsal subluxation vary by thumb pose, time, and disease severity in patients with thumb CMC OA? (2) In which thumb pose(s) does dorsal subluxation most differentiate patients with stable CMC OA from those with progressing CMC OA? (3) In those poses, what values of dorsal subluxation indicate a high likelihood of CMC OA progression?

Methods

Between 2011 and 2014, 743 patients were seen at our institutions for trapeziometacarpal pain. We considered individuals who were between the ages of 45 and 75 years, had tenderness to palpation or a positive grind test result, and had modified Eaton Stage 0 or 1 radiographic thumb CMC OA as potentially eligible for enrollment. Based on these criteria, 109 patients were eligible. Of the eligible patients, 19 were excluded because of a lack of interest in study participation, and another four were lost before the minimum study follow-up or had incomplete datasets, leaving 86 (43 female patients with a mean age of 53 ± 6 years and 43 male patients with a mean age of 60 ± 7 years) patients for analysis. Twenty-five asymptomatic participants (controls) aged 45 to 75 years were also prospectively recruited to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for controls included an absence of thumb pain and no evidence of CMC OA during clinical examination. Of the 25 recruited controls, three were lost to follow-up, leaving 22 for analysis (13 female patients with a mean age of 55 ± 7 years and nine male patients with a mean age of 58 ± 9 years). Over the 6-year study period, CT images were acquired of patients and controls in 11 thumb poses: neutral, adduction, abduction, flexion, extension, grasp, jar, pinch, grasp loaded, jar loaded, and pinch loaded. CT images were acquired at enrollment (Year 0) and Years 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 for patients and at Years 0 and 6 for controls. From the CT images, bone models of the first metacarpal (MC1) and trapezium were segmented, and coordinate systems were calculated from their CMC articular surfaces. The volar-dorsal location of the MC1 relative to the trapezium was computed and normalized for bone size. Patients were categorized into stable OA and progressing OA subgroups based on trapezial osteophyte volume. MC1 volar-dorsal location was analyzed by thumb pose, time, and disease severity using linear mixed-effects models. Data are reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval. Differences in volar-dorsal location at enrollment and rate of migration during the study were analyzed for each thumb pose by group (control, stable OA, and progressing OA). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of MC1 location was used to identify thumb poses that differentiated patients whose OA was stable from those whose OA was progressing. The Youden J statistic was used to determine optimized cutoff values of subluxation from those poses to be tested as indicators of OA progression. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values were calculated to assess the performance of pose-specific cutoff values of MC1 locations as indicators of progressing OA.

Results

In flexion, the MC1 locations were volar to the joint center in patients with stable OA (mean -6.2% [95% CI -8.8% to -3.6%]) and controls (mean -6.1% [95% CI -8.9% to -3.2%]), while patients with progressing OA exhibited dorsal subluxation (mean 5.0% [95% CI 1.3% to 8.6%]; p < 0.001). The pose associated with the most rapid MC1 dorsal subluxation in the progressing OA group was thumb flexion (mean 3.2% [95% CI 2.5% to 3.9%] increase per year). In contrast, the MC1 migrated dorsally much slower in the stable OA group (p < 0.001), at only a mean of 0.1% (95% CI -0.4% to 0.6%) per year. A cutoff value of 1.5% for the volar MC1 position during flexion at enrollment (C-statistic: 0.70) was a moderate indicator of OA progression, with a high positive predictive value (0.80) but low negative predictive value (0.54). Positive and negative predictive values of subluxation rate in flexion (2.1% per year) were high (0.81 and 0.81, respectively). The metric that most indicated a high likelihood of OA progression (sensitivity 0.96, negative predictive value 0.89) was a dual cutoff that combined the subluxation rate in flexion (2.1% per year) with that of loaded pinch (1.2% per year).

Conclusion

In the thumb flexion pose, only the progressing OA group exhibited MC1 dorsal subluxation. The MC1 location cutoff value for progression in flexion was 1.5% volar to the trapezium, which suggests that dorsal subluxation of any amount in this pose indicates a high likelihood of thumb CMC OA progression. However, volar MC1 location in flexion alone was not sufficient to rule out progression. The availability of longitudinal data improved our ability to identify patients whose disease will likely remain stable. In patients whose MC1 location during flexion changed < 2.1% per year and whose MC1 location during pinch loading changed < 1.2% per year, the confidence that their disease would remain stable throughout the 6-year study period was very high. These cutoff rates were a lower limit, and any patients whose dorsal subluxation advanced faster than 2% to 1% per year in their respective hand poses, were highly likely to experience progressive disease.

Clinical Relevance

Our findings suggest that in patients with early signs of CMC OA, nonoperative interventions aimed to reduce further dorsal subluxation or operative treatments that spare the trapezium and limit subluxation may be effective. It remains to be determined whether our subluxation metrics can be rigorously computed from more widely available technologies, such as plain radiography or ultrasound.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Thumb metacarpophalangeal joint ulnar collateral ligament injuries: management and biomechanical evaluation [^116pdD3Q]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

First described in 1955 as "gamekeeper's thumb", injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint are common and can cause pain and instability, especially during key pinch and grasp. Although primarily diagnosed on physical examination, stress radiographs, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to diagnose UCL injuries and distinguish partial from complete tears. If complete rupture occurs, the adductor aponeurosis can become interposed between the retracted UCL stump and its insertion on the proximal phalanx, known as a "Stener lesion". When instability persists after a trial of nonsurgical management or in the setting of complete rupture, there are various methods of repair or reconstruction. Biomechanically, there are no treatments of repair or reconstruction using native tissues that provide equivalent strength to the preinjured ligament. Recently, suture tape augmentation has been used for the repair or reconstruction with excellent short-term results and earlier return to function, although there is a paucity of literature on longer term outcomes. The various methods of surgical treatment yield excellent outcomes with a low incidence of complications.

### WITHDRAWN: surgery for thumb (trapeziometacarpal joint) osteoarthritis [^111pF2PF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery is used to treat persistent pain and dysfunction at the base of the thumb when conservative management, such as splinting, or medical management, such as oral analgesics, is no longer adequate in reducing disability and pain. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different surgical techniques for trapeziometacarpal (thumb) osteoarthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources up to 08 August 2013: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2013), EMBASE (1974 to August 2013), CINAHL (1982 to August 2013), Clinicaltrials.gov (to August 2013) and World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Portal (to August 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs where the intervention was surgery for people with thumb osteoarthritis. Outcomes were pain, physical function, quality of life, patient global assessment, adverse events, treatment failure or trapeziometacarpal joint imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently screened and included studies according to the inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data, including adverse events.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 670 participants. Seven surgical procedures were identified (trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI), trapeziectomy, trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction, trapeziectomy with interpositional arthroplasty (IA), Artelon joint resurfacing, arthrodesis and Swanson joint replacement). We did not find any studies that compared surgery with sham surgery or surgery with non-surgical interventions. Most included studies had an unclear risk of most biases which raises doubt about the results. No procedure demonstrated any superiority over another in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, patient global assessment, adverse events, treatment failure (re-operation) or trapeziometacarpal joint imaging. One study demonstrated a difference in adverse events (mild-moderate swelling) between Artelon joint replacement and trapeziectomy with tendon interposition. However, the quality of evidence was very low due to a high risk of bias and imprecision of results. Low quality evidence suggests trapeziectomy with LRTI may not provide additional benefits or result in more adverse events over trapeziectomy alone. Mean pain (three studies, 162 participants) was 26 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (0 is no pain) for trapeziectomy alone, trapeziectomy with LRTI reduced pain by a mean of 2.8 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.8 to 4.2) or an absolute reduction of 3% (-10% to 4%). Mean physical function (three studies, 211 participants) was 31.1 points on a 0 to 100 point scale (0 is best physical function, or no disability) with trapeziectomy alone, trapeziectomy with LRTI resulted in sightly lower function scores (standardised mean difference 0.1, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.32), an equivalent to a worsening of 0.2 points (95% CI -5.8 to 6.1) on a 0 to 100 point scale (absolute decrease in function 0.03% (-0.83% to 0.88%)). Low quality evidence from four studies (328 participants) indicates that the mean number of adverse events was 10 per 100 participants for trapeziectomy alone, and 19 events per 100 participants for trapeziectomy with LRTI (RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.73) or an absolute risk increase of 9% (95% CI 0% to 28%). Low quality evidence from one study (42 participants) indicates that the mean scapho-metacarpal distance was 2.3 mm for the trapeziectomy alone group, trapeziectomy with LRTI resulted in a mean of 0.1 mm less distance (95% CI -0.81 to 0.61). None of the included trials reported global assessment, quality of life, and revision or re-operation rates. Low-quality evidence from two small studies (51 participants) indicated that trapeziectomy with LRTI may not improve function or slow joint degeneration, or produce additional adverse events over trapeziectomy and ligament reconstruction. We are uncertain of the benefits or harms of other surgical techniques due to the mostly low quality evidence from single studies and the low reporting rates of key outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to assess if trapeziectomy with LRTI had additional benefit over arthrodesis or trapeziectomy with IA. There was also insufficient evidence to assess if trapeziectomy with IA had any additional benefit over the Artelon joint implant, the Swanson joint replacement or trapeziectomy alone.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not identify any studies that compared surgery to sham surgery or to non-operative treatments. We were unable to demonstrate that any technique confers a benefit over another technique in terms of pain and physical function. Furthermore, the included studies were not of high enough quality to provide conclusive evidence that the compared techniques provided equivalent outcomes.

### Spontaneous painful subungual thumb haematoma [^111Qbm8D]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 56-year-old man who presented to our accident and emergency department 15 years after a work-based injury to his left thumb. In January 2017, the patient was woken up acutely with excruciating pain in his left thumb with no preceding trauma. On clinical examination, only a subungual haematoma was noted. Radiographs of the effected thumb demonstrated a round, lytic lesion with an accompanying hairline fracture on the distal phalanx of the left thumb. The radiologist suggested a differential diagnosis of enchondroma should be considered. The patient was referred for a routine plastic surgery outpatient appointment. Curettage sampling of the lesion was performed and a cement filler was used to prevent further pathological fractures. The biopsy report stated that the sample contained normal bone tissue with no evidence of enchondroma or other malignancy and the patient was discharged without any further complications.

### Management of thumb metacarpophalangeal ulnar collateral ligament injuries [^115P3AaM]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Untreated ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) can lead to long-term pain and functional limitations. Detection of a UCL injury involves sequential examination of true and accessory ligaments and comparison with the uninjured side. Acute partial UCL injuries can be successfully treated nonoperatively. Acute complete or displaced UCL injuries can be successfully treated with operative repair. In cases of chronic UCL injury, treatment options include static and dynamic reconstructions. If painful arthrosis is present with chronic UCL instability, salvage may be performed with MCPJ fusion.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^113KxxLx]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate: (i) the frequency and patterns of radiographic OA (ROA) in the thumb joints; and (ii) associations between thumb ROA and the clinical characteristics of thumb OA in older adults with hand pain or problems.

Methods

Participants were 592 community-dwelling older adults with hand pain or hand problems who attended a research clinic. Hand X-rays were taken and 32 joints were scored for the presence of ROA. The occurrence and pattern of ROA in the hand were examined. Univariable and multivariable associations of thumb pain and clinical assessments (nodes, deformity, enlargement, thenar muscle wasting, grind test, Kapandji index, Finkelstein's test and thumb extension) with ROA were investigated.

Results

The first CMC and thumb IP joints were the hand joints most frequently affected with ROA. The thumb (thumb IP, first MCP, first CMC, trapezioscaphoid) was the most commonly affected joint group (n = 412). Isolated thumb ROA occurred more frequently than in any other isolated joint group. Multivariable analyses showed that older age, thumb pain, thenar muscle wasting and presence of nodes, deformity or enlargement best determined the presence of thumb ROA.

Conclusion

The first CMC and thumb IP joints were frequently affected with ROA. Prevalence estimates of ROA would be underestimated if these were not scored. One-third of the individuals with thumb ROA did not have involvement of the first CMC joint. The presence of thumb ROA was strongly associated with a combination of older age, thumb pain and clinical features of OA.

### US diagnosis of UCL tears of the thumb and stener lesions: technique, pattern-based approach, and differential diagnosis [^11794R86]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

The thumb is a central component supporting the intricate movements of the hand. Patients with acute thumb pain, particularly after trauma, require prompt evaluation of structural integrity, thus avoiding long-term morbidity such as instability, chronic pain, and osteoarthritis. Injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb requires imaging for diagnosis of surgically important entities such as the Stener lesion. Historically, routine radiography including stress views does not allow such diagnosis and is potentially detrimental to patient care. Both magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (US) are currently used for direct evaluation of the UCL of the thumb and are safe and accurate. US is more dynamic and less time-consuming and may be easier to perform. Furthermore, other disorders such as tenosynovitis, tendon tears, and articular pathologic conditions can involve the thumb and thenar region and may also be diagnosed with US. In this context, US is an underused tool because it is potentially an adjunct to the clinical examination in the appropriate setting. A sound knowledge of the regional anatomy and basic training in the principles of US should equip the imager with the skills necessary to evaluate the UCL of the thumb and its surrounding structures.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115CfiNL]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Based on our findings, we recommend that clinicians offer patients with DQT of any chronicity a conventional CSI at first contact. This should be supplemented with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks in the form of a full-time (minus grooming and simple daily range-of-movement exercises) thumb spica splint that includes the wrist and the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint but not the thumb interphalangeal joint. If the symptoms persist 3 to 4 months later, we recommend that a diagnostic ultrasonographic scan is performed, at which point a further ultrasonography-guided CSI can be administered on confirmation of the diagnosis of DQT. This should also be supplemented with a thumb spica splint for 3 to 4 weeks. If this does not result in resolution of symptoms within 3 to 4 months, then surgical release is recommended. No definitive recommendations can be provided for the type of surgery or type of incision due to inadequate evidence. All patients should be warned about complications of surgery as part of the informed consent process, especially injury to the superficial radial nerve and its consequences. At all stages of treatment, advice about lifestyle modifications should be provided to limit overuse of the affected tendons. Figure 4 illustrates our recommended management pathway.

Figure 4.
Suggested Treatment Algorithm for de Quervain Tenosynovitis (DQT)

CSI indicates conventional corticosteroid; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; US, ultrasonography.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. Chronicity of the condition, which could influence effectiveness of interventions, was not considered and neither was type, number, or dose of CSIs. Similarly, simultaneous consumption of NSAIDs was not controlled for, as the included studies did not provide relevant data. Additionally, not all interventions were available for participation in all networks; specifically surgical interventions could not be included in any quantitative analyses for pain and function. Furthermore, the diagnostic criteria of some studies may have been inadequate, having only included the Finkelstein test. However, we did include all eligible studies that derived from a thorough literature search and combined data appropriately in quantitative analyses that included a network meta-analysis. Additionally, we performed detailed ROB and certainty of evidence assessments for each outcome separately.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain ultrasound or MRI as the next imaging for the evaluation of chronic hand or wrist pain with normal radiographs or radiographs remarkable for nonspecific arthritis if there is concern for tendon injury, tenosynovitis, or tendon pathology.

### A recurred subungual glomus tumour of the thumb [^111s2gnx]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Glomus tumours are rare benign neoplasms arising from the glomus body, accounting for 1–5% of all soft-tissue tumours of the hand. The diagnosis of glomus tumour is frequently delayed, varying from 3 to 15years. We present a case of a recurred glomus tumour of the thumb where symptoms persisted for a period of 6years after an attempted surgical excision. The patient presented with classical symptoms of localised tenderness, cold sensitivity and excruciating pain on touch. Findings on radiograph, ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced MRI further supported the diagnosis. Complete surgical excision, the only recommended treatment, resulted in complete symptomatic relief to the patient. This case report highlights the importance of meticulous complete excision and clinical awareness of the disease among primary care physicians.

### Current concepts of the carpal boss: pathophysiology, symptoms, clinical or imaging diagnosis, and management [^1119DHEJ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The carpal boss reflects an osseous protuberance at the level of the dorsal base of the second or third metacarpal, variably present in the general population. There are numerous theories as to the etiology of the bony excrescence; however, the exact cause remains uncertain. The abnormality can result in dorsal wrist pain and swelling. The diagnosis is typically established based on clinical examination and imaging, including radiography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We review the proposed theories of how the carpal boss develops, explain the clinical manifestations, demonstrate the imaging appearance, and address treatment strategies.

### Phalangeal osteoid osteoma of thumb [^116w5zhU]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoid osteomas are typically benign osteoblastic bone tumors. Patients often present in their twenties with progressively increasing pain that is worse at night and relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These lesions rarely occur in the hand or wrist; however, when those are involved, the proximal phalanx is the most common location and the index finger is the most commonly affected digit. Lesions affecting the distal phalanges are least likely to occur and the thumb is least likely to be affected. Osteoid osteomas of the distal phalanges can cause great diagnostic challenges. They often present with atypical radiographic and physical examination findings. Although rare, osteoid osteomas of the distal phalanx can be a major cause of digit enlargement and pain. In a patient with a painful and/or swollen digit, the diagnosis should be considered.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1137KXHe]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Randomized and observational evidence on x-ray referral in LBP without red flags — one Level II study shows that in the absence of red flags, x-rays do not provide additional benefit at initial consultation. Across 94 general practices, over the course of 26 months, patients with LBP aged 16–64 years were allocated to a RCT (n = 153) or an observational arm (n = 506); the RCT randomized to immediate x-ray referral (n = 73) or no immediate x-ray referral (control) (n = 80). Outcomes were assessed at enrollment, 6 weeks and one year, with response rate at one year 67%. In the RCT there were no differences in physical functioning, pain, or disability compared to control, but the immediate radiography group scored higher on psychological wellbeing at 6 weeks and one year. In the observational arm, after adjusting for length of back pain episode at presentation, there were no differences in physical outcomes, and those referred for x-ray had lower depression scores at six weeks and one year. The work group downgraded this potential Level I study due to poor follow-up, significant crossover and potential bias, and this study provides Level II evidence that, in the absence of red flags, x-ray does not provide additional benefit at initial consultation.

### Sports-related extensor carpi ulnaris pathology: a review of functional anatomy, sports injury and management [^1133SEvn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with active tendinopathy and tenosynovitis of the ECU will often have a vague and subtle swelling over the dorsoulnar aspect of the affected wrist. The pain has two components — a constant dull aching sensation on the dorsoulnar aspect of the affected wrist and a sudden searing longitudinal pain felt along the course of the distal ECU tendon on active contraction of the muscle.

The ECU Synergy Test, has been shown to be sensitive as well as specific for the diagnosis of ECU tendinosis. It is performed with the patient's elbow resting on the examination table, flexed at 90° and the forearm fully supinated. The patient actively and fully extends all the digits while the wrist is held in neutral and faces the examiner. The examiner places one hand to palpate the ECU tendon and with the other on the radial side of the adducted thumb. The patient is asked to resist the examiner's attempts to adduct the thumb and the examiner's other hand feels the ECU tendon contract isometrically to resist adduction of the thumb as this action is performed. Pain along the course of the ECU tendon during this manoeuvre has been shown to represent a positive test for ECU tendinosis.

ECU tendinosis can coexist with other conditions in the ulnar side of the wrist, so the diagnosis must not be considered as an exclusion of all other possible diagnoses. A full clinical and radiological assessment of the other important ulnar-sided wrist structures is mandatory to exclude coexistent pathology in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), lunotriquetral ligament, distal radioulnar joint or ulnar styloid.

Imaging

In equivocal or difficult cases, ultrasound (US) or MRI are the imaging modalities of choice to supplement the clinical diagnosis of ECU tendinopathy and instability. Conventional X-rays are not routinely required.

US has several advantages. The examination is rapid, inflammatory changes can be assessed with Doppler imaging without the need for intravenous contrast agents, the opposite limb may be used for comparison and dynamic assessment can be performed between pronation and supination. MRI is able to assess other structures such as the TFCC that are not easily accessible to US evaluation.

### Tendon and ligament injuries of the finger and thumb in athletes: a narrative review [^116e7gvN]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Volar plate injury

Injury to the volar plate may be caused by finger joint hyperextension or dorsal dislocations (figure 2). This type of injury is commonly seen in netball, basketball and cricket. A scenario that may cause this type of injury is when an athlete blocks a shot or a pass in a basketball game. This injury has a predilection for the PIP joint (the most commonly dislocated joint), which is especially prone to dorsal dislocations as the central slip is weaker than the volar plate. Patients will present with volar pain at the affected joint and may also have pain on the lateral sides of the injured joint since concurrent collateral ligament injuries are common. Ultrasonography helps identify volar plate injuries and might avoid the need for an MRI.

Untreated chronic volar plate injuries may result in a pseudoboutonnière deformity due to scarred tissue contracting the PIP joint into flexion. This condition exclusively affects the fourth and fifth fingers and should be distinguished from a boutonnière deformity. Unstable joints, irreducible dislocations or a large associated avulsion fracture are likely to need surgical intervention. Otherwise, a dorsal blocking aluminium splint angling the PIP joint at 30° flexion (figure 2) with weekly increases in the extension angle by 8–10° until full extension is achieved, with buddy taping used thereafter is recommended. However, a recent studyshowed that figure-of-8 orthoses with limitation to extension by 15–20° had similar outcomes for stable PIP volar plate injuries when compared with dorsal blocking splints. Unlike the figure-of-8 orthosis, dorsal blocking splints had to be serially extended by 10° weekly (starting at 30° flexion), possibly making the figure-of-8 orthosis a more attractive option for volar plate injuries due to ease of use.

### Tendon and ligament injuries of the finger and thumb in athletes: a narrative review [^115LRs1F]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Maintaining a high level of suspicion for UCL injuries is crucial to prevent the development of a weak pinch grip, which is an essential function of the thumb's UCL. To identify an unstable joint, valgus stress is applied to the MCP joint. Of note, a nerve block (eg, ultrasound-guided median and radial nerve block with 1% lidocaine (2–5 mL for each nerve)) injected 3–5 min prior to the physical exam may be needed to reduce pain. If the application of valgus stress reveals joint laxity compared with the uninjured thumb, laxity without a fixed endpoint, or laxity > 30°, this suggests a complete UCL tear (table 1), requiring surgical intervention to reattach the ligament to the bone (figure 4). Additionally, surgical correction is indicated for a Stener lesion because the adductor aponeurosis prevents ulnar ligament contact with the bony insertion (figure 4), which is essential for healing. Otherwise, laxity of < 30° is suggestive of a partial tear and may be treated with a thumb-spica cast or splint for 4–6 weeks followed by thumb rehabilitation exercises. In a recent meta-analysis, no difference in clinical outcomes was noted between different surgical techniques (eg, bone anchor reinsertion, suture fixation, Kirschner-wire fixation of avulsion fracture or combination of techniques), suggesting that the ideal procedure is reliant on surgeon preference.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^112xkEWc]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate: (i) the frequency and patterns of radiographic OA (ROA) in the thumb joints; and (ii) associations between thumb ROA and the clinical characteristics of thumb OA in older adults with hand pain or problems.

Methods. Participants were 592 community-dwelling older adults with hand pain or hand problems who attended a research clinic. Hand X-rays were taken and 32 joints were scored for the presence of ROA. The occurrence and pattern of ROA in the hand were examined. Univariable and multivariable associations of thumb pain and clinical assessments (nodes, deformity, enlargement, thenar muscle wasting, grind test, Kapandji index, Finkelstein's test and thumb extension) with ROA were investigated.

Results. The first CMC and thumb IP joints were the hand joints most frequently affected with ROA. The thumb (thumb IP, first MCP, first CMC, trapezioscaphoid) was the most commonly affected joint group (n = 412). Isolated thumb ROA occurred more frequently than in any other isolated joint group. Multivariable analyses showed that older age, thumb pain, thenar muscle wasting and presence of nodes, deformity or enlargement best determined the presence of thumb ROA.

Conclusion. The first CMC and thumb IP joints were frequently affected with ROA. Prevalence estimates of ROA would be underestimated if these were not scored. One-third of the individuals with thumb ROA did not have involvement of the first CMC joint. The presence of thumb ROA was strongly associated with a combination of older age, thumb pain and clinical features of OA.

### Consequences of untreated pediatric trigger thumb: case report [^112hDZ2M]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric trigger thumbs present a conundrum for hand surgeons. Surgery for trigger thumbs has inherent risks, such as infection, nerve injury, and the risks of anesthesia, but will reliably solve the problem. But is surgical intervention necessary? Would these cases resolve spontaneously, eventually, without intervention? If not, what are the long-term consequences of the inability to fully extend the thumb interphalangeal joint? We present a pediatric trigger thumb that was symptomatic for 22 years, with complete resolution of symptoms after surgical intervention. This report illustrates at least some pediatric trigger thumbs will not resolve without surgical intervention, but treatment, even after 21 years, can result in normal thumb motion and function.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^116bdWeH]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Good discrimination between individuals with or without thumb ROA was found for the multivariable models. This study has shown that in combination, age, thumb pain, thenar muscle wasting, and the presence of nodes, deformity and enlargement are able to identify most individuals with thumb ROA. This could be useful in large population studies where radiography is not feasible. However, performance of these models could potentially be further improved, as several important items, such as severity of thumb pain and pain on palpation were not included in our study. Palpation of the first CMC joint may also indicate the presence of crepitus in the joint capsule, another clinical sign of OA.

Few studies have examined the thumb as a complex and the CAS-HA study provided a rich source of self-report, radiographic, physical examination and clinical assessment data to investigate associations of clinical signs and symptoms with the presence of thumb ROA. One limitation is that missing data may have led to bias as data were mainly missing from participants who were unable to adopt the starting position or complete a test due to the presence of pain. However, for each test the amount of missing data was small (< 3.6%). For the multivariable analysis, a complete case approach was taken, which meant that up to 10.2% of participants with any missing data were not included in these analyses. Finally, these findings need further testing in other populations to test their external validity.

In summary, this research has shown that the thumb IP and first CMC joints were frequently affected with ROA. Estimates of prevalence of thumb ROA may be underestimated if the thumb IP joints are not scored. ROA of both the left and right thumbs were most strongly associated with a combination of older age, thumb pain, thenar muscle wasting and the presence of nodes, deformity and enlargement. This model should be tested in other populations and future studies could improve on this model by including additional relevant features and clinical assessments.

### Patterns of multisite pain and associations with risk factors [^116NkYPK]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Optimal case definition for multisite pain depends on its practical utility in distinguishing illness with causes, prognosis, or response to treatment that differs importantly from that of pain occurring in other patterns. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple anatomical sites according to the number of sites affected. Although there was a threshold number of painful sites, above which prevalence was clearly higher than would have been expected by chance coincidence, we did not identify a threshold number of affected sites above which associations with risk factors were qualitatively different. Rather, associations became progressively stronger, the larger the number of sites with pain. Nevertheless, risk estimates for several variables were much larger in relation to extensive than limited pain. This suggests that in future research on pain at specific sites such as the back and wrist/hand, there may be value in distinguishing cases with localised pain from those in which pain is more extensive.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1165MgyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — monitoring response, remission targets, relapse assessment, and monostotic disease guidance includes that if there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short-term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely; we suggest that patients who have osteolytic lesions have a repeat x-ray approximately 1 year after radiological diagnosis, with subsequent x-rays considered in the event of persistent elevations of biochemical markers of bone turnover or the presence of bone pain and to determine when there is resolution of the lesion; to maximize the duration of remission, we suggest that bone turnover should be reduced below the midpoint of the reference range for the chosen monitoring bone turnover marker; in patients with increased bone turnover, we recommend that biochemical follow-up be used as a more objective indicator of relapse than symptoms; and for untreated monostotic disease, we suggest that amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) or bone-specific ALP (BSAP) and βCterminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTx) or N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) should be used for assessing activity, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy.

### Two-year changes in magnetic resonance imaging features and pain in thumb base osteoarthritis [^111a3y8q]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, increase in structural damage was more often seen on MRI than on radiography. The higher sensitivity of MRI to detect structural damage was also shown in a recent cross‐sectional study. Currently, structural damage assessed on radiographs is considered the gold standard. Whether an increase in structural damage on MRI that is not visible on radiography is clinically relevant should be investigated in future studies.

To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the course of clinical and MRI parameters in thumb base OA in a study with a considerable sample size. This cohort, recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic in a secondary and tertiary referral center, is a good representation of hand OA patients who are in need of and could benefit from treatment but who may be different from a primary care population; hence, results should be extrapolated with caution. As a result of including patients with hand OA, but not necessarily thumb base OA, our cohort consisted of patients with a wide variety of thumb base OA disease stages.

An important limitation of this study is the low number of patients in whom a change in pain, MRI features, or structural damage occurred, which demonstrates that the natural course of thumb base OA is a slow process. As a consequence, the estimated associations are less accurate, which is reflected by wide CIs, especially for the stratified analyses. Future studies investigating the longitudinal relationship between pain, MR‐defined inflammation, and radiographic damage with a large group size and longer follow‐up are therefore warranted. Additionally, analyses in the setting of a positive clinical trial would provide more insight in associations with improvement in pain. Another limitation might be the possible use of over‐the‐counter analgesics and thumb base splints in this observational cohort. However, in general, the efficacy of analgesics for treating OA pain is small, and even though a recent meta‐analysis showed positive effects of thumb base splinting on pain, there is no evidence that these interventions influence MRI features. Therefore, we believe these interventions might only have introduced nondifferential misclassification, but not bias, in the studied associations. Last, pain experience can be modulated by psychosocial and other contextual factors, which were not taken into account. Although, by using pain on palpation — instead of self‐reported pain — these effects were mitigated, and more importantly, there is no reason to believe that these contextual factors can influence MRI features.

### Radiographic thumb osteoarthritis: frequency, patterns and associations with pain and clinical assessment findings in a community-dwelling population [^113sQAMG]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we examined the occurrence and patterns of involvement of ROA in the joints of the thumb in a community-dwelling population of older adults, and investigated associations between thumb pain, positive results of the clinical assessment findings and the presence of thumb ROA.

A high frequency of ROA was seen in the first CMC joint, which is consistent with the previous findings, but the frequent involvement of the thumb IP joint has only been described in a few studies. The lack of information about the involvement of this joint is partly due to its inconsistent inclusion and classification in studies of hand ROA. When the thumb joints (thumb IP, first MCP, first CMC and TS) were assessed collectively they were found to be the most frequently affected joint group followed by the DIPs. This is inconsistent with previous research undertaken in a Dutch population where the DIP joints, including the thumb IP, were more frequently affected than the base of the thumb. However, when data from our study were reanalysed using the same classification as the Dutch study, the same patterns were found. This indicates that the classification of the thumb IP joint can make substantial differences when examining the frequency of involvement in different joint groups within the hand.

Similar associations for thumb pain, thenar muscle wasting, and the presence of nodes, deformity or enlargement were found when defining thumb ROA as involvement of the first CMC joint, as when analysing involvement of any thumb joint. This could suggest that nothing is gained by including the other joints of the thumb. However, the group of participants with any thumb joint affected with ROA included an additional 98 participants who did not have first CMC involvement. If only the first CMC joints were examined, these individuals would not have been identified as having thumb ROA, even though they experienced similar levels of pain and disability.

Multivariable analysis found that the combination of age, thumb pain, muscle wasting, and the presence of nodes, deformity or enlargement best determined the presence of thumb ROA. None of the clinical assessments contributed to these models. Although a univariable association was found between thumb ROA and a positive grind test, in combination with other factors this test was not significantly associated with the presence of ROA. The frequency of a positive grind test in this sample was low. It has been suggested that this test may not be positive in milder cases, and therefore when combined with other clinical features of OA the grind test could add little information to the models.

### Acute blue finger syndrome: a rare benign cause of acute digit discolouration [^111eBnDH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute blue finger syndrome is a rare benign condition that mimics digital ischaemia. We discuss the case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with a 6hour history of blue discolouration of the middle finger of the right hand, associated with pain and swelling. There was no history of trauma and this was the first time that the patient had experienced these symptoms. Examination found blue discolouration of the digit primarily on the volar aspect with associated swelling. All investigations, including blood tests, X-rays and Doppler scanning, were normal. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48hours. There were no recurrent episodes or long-term sequelae. Patients presenting with an acutely blue finger need rapid assessment to exclude digit ischaemia. Knowledge of this rare benign condition may prevent unnecessary distress, invasive investigations and potentially harmful treatment of a healthy patient.
