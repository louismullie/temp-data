## Question

In what ways does disseminated herpes present differently in neonates compared with adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) presents differently in neonates versus adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about timing and epidemiologic context of disease onset. Then, I should compare dermatologic findings. Next, I will contrast multi-organ involvement and severity patterns. After that, I need to examine central nervous system phenotypes and neuroimaging. I will then review immunologic and pathophysiologic differences. Finally, I should consider prognostic outcomes, diagnostic implications, and treatment nuances that diverge between neonates and adults.

> Let me first confirm the temporal pattern and age of onset, because timing often cues pathogenesis and clinical suspicion. Neonatal disseminated HSV most often declares itself between days 5–9 of life, consistent with peripartum acquisition and a short incubation, and can deteriorate rapidly over a few days, frequently masquerading as bacterial sepsis at the outset, which is why recognition is so often delayed [^114GjVyY] [^115ZvwUn]. In contrast, adults can present at any age, with disseminated disease uncommon and usually in the setting of immunocompromise; they more often manifest as single-system HSV syndromes (encephalitis for HSV-1, meningitis for HSV-2) without a consistent temporal clustering after exposure, so I need to be careful not to assume a stereotyped window in adults [^112GYB4H].

> Now, I will examine skin findings, since cutaneous clues can be misleading in neonates. Wait, let me verify the frequency of rash in neonatal dissemination: about a third of neonates with disseminated disease never have vesicles at presentation or during the acute course, so absence of rash cannot reassure me and indeed delays therapy in practice, which is a critical pitfall in this age group [^112U3BEx] [^114GjVyY]. Initially, I almost wrote that adult disseminated HSV lesions are "dermatomal", but hold on, that's characteristic of varicella-zoster, not HSV; adult HSV typically produces grouped vesicles on an erythematous base at mucocutaneous sites, and when dissemination occurs it is usually in immunocompromised hosts where skin findings can be widespread but still classically herpetic rather than dermatomal, so I should correct that assumption here.

> Next, I should review multi-organ involvement patterns to clarify why neonatal dissemination is so lethal. In neonates, true multi-organ failure is the rule rather than the exception, with fulminant hepatic injury, pneumonitis and respiratory failure, coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia/DIC, and shock physiology including capillary leak, often evolving over hours to days; these patterns are well documented and strongly linked to mortality when recognition and acyclovir are delayed [^116zMVNE] [^115ZvwUn] [^116Uu49T] [^116aUnXw]. By comparison, adults far more often have single-organ–predominant disease (e.g., encephalitis or meningitis without concurrent hepatic and pulmonary failure), and disseminated multi-organ failure is relatively uncommon outside of severe immunosuppression, so I need to keep the host immune context in mind when interpreting organ involvement in adults [^112GYB4H].

> I will now examine central nervous system (CNS) differences, because the neuroimaging phenotype diverges by age. Hmm, wait a minute, I started to assume temporal lobe tropism for all HSV encephalitis, but that is the classic adult HSV-1 pattern; neonatal HSV CNS disease often lacks the medial temporal predilection and can show bilateral corticospinal tract involvement, frontal opercular injury, or evolving multicystic encephalopathy, which should prompt urgent therapy even when imaging is atypical for adult patterns [^112CR2hB]. Adults, conversely, classically exhibit medial temporal and limbic involvement with focal deficits in HSV-1 encephalitis, while HSV-2 more often produces aseptic meningitis rather than frank encephalitis, so I should differentiate by type and syndrome in older hosts [^112GYB4H].

> Let me think about immunologic and pathophysiologic distinctions, since host response appears to drive much of neonatal severity. Neonates exhibit a hyperinflammatory systemic response in disseminated disease with markedly elevated cytokines and apoptosis markers (e.g. HMGB1 and cytochrome c), implying that immunopathology contributes substantially to organ failure, and early modulation of inflammation has been explored in case reports alongside antivirals, though evidence remains limited and timing seems critical [^111bxSea] [^113BFEso]. I should double-check cytokine age differences: some data suggest neonatal cells produce more IL-6 and IL-8 than adults in response to HSV via TLR2 signaling, potentially explaining a sepsis-like syndrome, while other pediatric immunology data show stimulus-dependent differences and even lower or similar cytokine release depending on combinations of pathogen signals, so I need to acknowledge that results are mixed and context specific rather than uniform across assays [^114xMAKe] [^112EkNEU]. Additionally, HSV-1 uniquely enhances apoptosis in neonatal but not adult neutrophils, impairing innate antiviral defense, and early-life ADCC effector function appears limited relative to adults, reducing the effectiveness of passively acquired antibodies until maturation, which together could facilitate dissemination in neonates [^113GPqkQ] [^113qGJgv].

> Next, I should review mortality and outcomes to anchor the clinical stakes. Untreated disseminated neonatal HSV carries catastrophic mortality near 85%, and even in the acyclovir era, mortality and severe neurodevelopmental sequelae remain substantial for disseminated and CNS disease, with contemporary cohorts still showing about 40% mortality in disseminated cases despite high-dose therapy and a high burden of neurologic impairment among survivors, so early recognition and treatment materially affect outcomes but do not eliminate risk [^116xCdb9] [^114GjVyY] [^1158v5Wf]. Adults generally have markedly lower mortality when promptly treated, particularly for meningitis and even encephalitis relative to neonates, though morbidity can still be significant, so I should avoid directly extrapolating neonatal risk to adults while maintaining urgency in suspected adult encephalitis [^112GYB4H].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic implications, because missing neonatal HSV is common. In neonates, the presentation often mimics bacterial sepsis with nonspecific signs, and the absence of vesicles or a benign-appearing CBC cannot exclude HSV; therefore, a low threshold for testing and starting empiric IV acyclovir is essential, particularly in infants ≤ 21 days with fever or sepsis-like illness, seizures, hepatitis, respiratory failure, or coagulopathy, while obtaining HSV PCR from blood and CSF and surface swabs improves diagnostic yield and speeds confirmation compared to culture [^112NnALb] [^1119LYhY] [^115ZvwUn] [^114NbMdv]. I should confirm that delays in acyclovir initiation correlate with worse outcomes, especially in those with respiratory disease, reinforcing the need to treat before definitive results return when suspicion is moderate to high in young infants, whereas adults are more often triaged by syndrome-guided testing and empiric therapy in encephalitis pathways with neuroimaging patterns that support early acyclovir [^115ZvwUn] [^112GYB4H].

> I need to ensure the therapeutic nuances are clear and age-appropriate. For neonates with suspected disseminated or CNS HSV, high-dose IV acyclovir at 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (60 mg/kg/day) for 21 days is standard and supported by FDA-reviewed trials demonstrating improved survival relative to lower dosing, whereas shorter courses are reserved only for strictly localized skin/eye/mouth disease; this intensity and duration differ from typical adult HSV management, where dosing, duration, and indications are tailored to the adult syndrome and organ involvement rather than universal 21-day high-dose courses [^111K6dfG] [^113BK9fh] [^116xCdb9]. Let me reconsider adjuncts: while case-based reports have explored anti-inflammatory strategies during hyperinflammatory phases in neonates, the evidence is not definitive and should not delay acyclovir, so antivirals remain the cornerstone while supportive critical care addresses respiratory, hepatic, and hematologic failure [^113BFEso] [^116zMVNE].

> Finally, I will synthesize the key differential features to ensure I have not missed any critical divergence. Neonatal disseminated HSV characteristically presents in the first 1–2 weeks of life, often without vesicular rash, and rapidly evolves into simultaneous multi-organ failure with fulminant hepatitis, pneumonitis, coagulopathy/DIC, shock physiology, and diffuse CNS injury patterns that are not classically medial temporal, whereas adult HSV more commonly manifests as single-organ syndromes (HSV-1 encephalitis with limbic involvement or HSV-2 meningitis) and only rarely progresses to multi-organ failure outside of immunocompromise, translating into substantially higher neonatal mortality and morbidity despite appropriate therapy and underscoring the need for early empiric testing and high-dose acyclovir in neonates with compatible presentations [^114GjVyY] [^112U3BEx] [^116zMVNE] [^112CR2hB] [^1158v5Wf] [^112NnALb].

Disseminated herpes presents differently in neonates and adults due to immune maturity and exposure routes [^117SnCa8]. Neonates show early, nonspecific sepsis-like signs (lethargy, poor feeding, temperature instability, respiratory distress, jaundice, coagulopathy, shock) [^114GjVyY] with rapid progression to multiorgan failure [^116zMVNE] and high mortality if untreated [^116xCdb9]. Adults, typically immunocompromised, present later with localized lesions first (mucocutaneous or visceral), then systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, organ-specific pain) and lower mortality with prompt therapy. Neonates often lack vesicles at onset, while adults usually have them early; neonatal disease is more fulminant and rapidly progressive [^114GjVyY].

## Clinical presentation in neonates

Neonatal disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection **typically presents within the first two weeks of life**, most often between days 5 and 9 [^114GjVyY]. The presentation is characterized by:

- **Nonspecific systemic symptoms**: Lethargy, poor feeding, irritability, temperature instability (hypothermia or fever), and respiratory distress [^115ZvwUn] [^111bxSea] [^114GjVyY].
- **Rapid progression**: The disease rapidly progresses to multiorgan involvement, including liver dysfunction (jaundice, elevated transaminases), coagulopathy (bleeding diathesis), shock [^115ZvwUn], and multiorgan failure [^111bxSea] [^114GjVyY].
- **Skin lesions**: Vesicular skin lesions may be present but are often absent at initial presentation [^112U3BEx], delaying diagnosis [^1158v5Wf].
- **High mortality**: Untreated neonatal disseminated HSV infection has a mortality rate of approximately 85% [^116xCdb9] [^112NnALb] [^114GjVyY].

---

## Clinical presentation in adults

In contrast, in adults, particularly immunocompromised individuals, the disease **presents differently**:

- **Localized lesions**: Adults typically present initially with localized mucocutaneous lesions (oral or genital) before systemic dissemination occurs.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and organ-specific symptoms (e.g. hepatitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis) develop later in the course of the disease.
- **Lower mortality**: Mortality rates are significantly lower in adults compared to neonates, especially with prompt antiviral therapy.

---

## Immunological differences

Variations in clinical presentation largely reflect immune system maturity and function. In the **neonatal immune system**, impaired innate and adaptive responses [^113GPqkQ] — including reduced cytokine production [^112EkNEU] — increase susceptibility to viral infections. In contrast, the **adult immune system** is mature and capable of mounting effective responses that limit viral dissemination and disease severity.

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Diagnosing disseminated herpes infection in neonates is particularly challenging because early symptoms are nonspecific and characteristic vesicular lesions are often absent. Laboratory confirmation through **PCR testing** [^114GjVyY] of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and lesion samples is essential for accurate diagnosis [^114NbMdv].

## Summary of differences

| **Feature** | **Neonates** | **Adults** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial presentation | Nonspecific systemic symptoms (sepsis-like) | Localized mucocutaneous lesions |
| Progression | - Rapid <br/> - Fulminant <br/> - Multiorgan involvement | - Slower <br/> - Localized initially |
| Skin lesions | Often absent initially | Typically present early |
| Mortality | High (≈85% untreated) | - Lower <br/> - Especially with treatment |
| Immune response | - Immature <br/> - Impaired | - Mature <br/> - Effective |
| Diagnostic challenges | High due to nonspecific symptoms | Lower due to characteristic lesions |

---

In summary, disseminated herpes infection **presents differently in neonates and adults** because of immune system maturity and function. Neonates typically have nonspecific systemic symptoms with rapid progression to multiorgan failure, whereas adults usually present with localized lesions and slower progression [^116dAVuN].

A full-term infant girl presented with febrile illness, lethargy, and poor feeding at 3 days of age following a normal vaginal delivery complicated by prolonged expulsion of placental membranes. Initial laboratory investigations revealed a normal leukocyte count (11,100 cells/μL), a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level (18 mg/L), and elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 283 U/L and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 111 U/L). A sepsis screen was conducted, and she received treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs.

On day 4 of life, the infant exhibited signs of respiratory distress, necessitating intermittent mechanical ventilation. A chest radiograph indicated streaky and patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities and right-side pleural effusion. The neurologic examination revealed mild hypotonia. By day 6, the infant remained febrile, with thrombocytopenia (56,000 cells/μL), an increased C-reactive protein level (32 mg/L), signs of fulminant liver failure (AST 13,740 U/L and ALT 3,180 U/L), and marked coagulopathy. Despite full intensive care support, the infant succumbed to rapidly progressive multiple organ failure on day 9.

### Natural history of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections in the acyclovir era [^112U3BEx]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

During the two decades in which effective antiviral therapies have been available for neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease, changes have been documented not only in the outcomes of infected infants but also in the natural history of the disease itself. Numerous studies have previously reported that the early institution of antiviral therapy is beneficial to the outcome of the disease. The objective of this study was to provide an update on neonatal HSV disease to identify means by which future improvements in the management of HSV-infected neonates can be made.
- **Design/methods**: Neonates enrolled in two studies of parenteral acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV disease provided the data source. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group conducted the studies between 1981 and 1997. A total of 186 patients are summarized, all of whom were treated with acyclovir. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are reported.
- **Results**: Comparisons between patients treated in the periods between 1981–1988 and 1989–1997, according to the extent of disease, revealed that the mean time between the onset of disease symptoms and the initiation of therapy has not changed significantly from the early 1980s to the late 1990s. Of all patients evaluated, 40% had fetal scalp monitors during the delivery process. A significant minority of patients did not have skin vesicles at the time of their presentation and did not develop them during the acute HSV disease (39% of patients with disseminated disease; 32% of patients with…

### Disseminated neonatal herpes caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^114GjVyY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is among the most severe perinatal infections. Most (85%) neonatal HSV infections are acquired during delivery, although in utero (5%) and postnatal (10%) infections do occur. The risk for transmission to the newborn is much higher in women with primary HSV infections.

- **Infection localization and types**: Neonatal herpes can be localized to skin, eyes, and mouth (≈45% of cases), involve the central nervous system (≈30% of cases), or can cause disseminated infection involving multiple organs such as liver, lungs, adrenal glands, and brain (≈25% of cases).
- **Severity and treatment**: Disseminated infection is the most severe form of neonatal herpes, with a mortality rate of 85% for untreated neonates. It is usually observed when the infant is 5–9 days old; signs include irritability, seizures, respiratory distress, jaundice, bleeding diatheses, shock, and often vesicular exanthema. Early treatment with high-dose acyclovir reduces the mortality rate. Early recognition of disseminated infection is difficult because of nonspecific symptoms and signs of sepsis and because initiation of antiviral therapy is often delayed. The high risk for death requires prompt diagnostic evaluation that includes testing by HSV DNA PCR as the preferred method or virus culture.

Neonatal herpes can result from infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2; the latter is associated with a poorer prognosis. We report a case of disseminated neonatal herpes infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2.

### Acyclovir [^111K6dfG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of acyclovir were evaluated for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infection in neonates and infants. In one study (Study 1), acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (30 mg/kg/day) was compared with vidarabine. In a follow-up study (Study 2), acyclovir 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (60 mg/kg/day) was compared with acyclovir 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (45 mg/kg/day).

Study 2 was an open-label clinical trial aimed at establishing the safety and efficacy of acyclovir, administered either as 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (45 mg/kg/day) or 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (60 mg/kg/day), to neonates ≤ 28 days old with suspected HSV infection. A total of 88 neonates were enrolled in the trial and received IV acyclovir for 21 days. Of these, 69 had confirmed systemic disease, 10 had confirmed localized disease, and 9 had suspected but unconfirmed infection. Among the 79 subjects with confirmed infection, 13 received 45 mg/kg/day and 66 received 60 mg/kg/day. The mean gestational ages were 37.5 weeks for the 45 mg/kg/day group and 37.9 weeks for the 60 mg/kg/day group. The number of premature infants (≤ 37 weeks GA) receiving 45 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day was 7 (54%) and 22 (33%), respectively.

Among 69 patients with proven systemic (disseminated or CNS) herpes infection, 57 were randomized to receive acyclovir (20 mg/kg every 8 hours), while the remaining 12 patients received a lower dose of acyclovir every 8 hours.

Clinical features

There were 9 (8%) cases with seizures. Eight had seizures during the admission for the CNS infection (5 with EV and 3 with HSV), and the ninth developed seizures after discharge, coinciding with CNS HSV relapse. For the 4 HSV cases, 2 had seizures only within the first 72 hours following diagnosis, 1 after 72 hours but prior to hospital discharge, and, as mentioned previously, one case only after discharge. Five of 103 infants with EV had seizures (5%), with 3 presenting in the first 72 hours following diagnosis and 2 presenting after 72 hours but prior to hospital discharge. The age at diagnosis of CNS infection for these 5 cases was 5, 10, 10, 14, and 84 days.

There were 14 (12%) infants with extra-CNS involvement. Five infants had extra-CNS HSV infection, consisting of vesicular lesions without other extra-CNS involvement (N = 1), transaminitis and pneumonitis (N = 1), transaminitis and vesicles (N = 1), and transaminitis, pneumonitis, and coagulopathy (N = 2). Coagulopathy was complicated by spontaneous intracranial haemorrhages (intraventricular and parenchymal) in one of these two infants. Extra-CNS manifestations in EV cases included rash (N = 2), pneumonia (N = 2), shock with coagulopathy (N = 2), myocarditis (N = 2), and transaminitis (N = 1). The median age of onset of the 7 cases with organ involvement (omitting the 2 with skin involvement) was 9 days (range 5–73 days). Extra-CNS involvement was more likely in HSV than EV cases (p < 0.001), even if skin involvement was not considered (4 [57%] versus 5 [6%]; p = 0.001).

Microbiology

All cases were diagnosed.

### Antiviral agents for treatment of herpes simplex virus infection in neonates [^116xCdb9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare but serious neonatal pathogen. Prior to the availability of antiviral drugs, the mortality associated with all but localized neonatal infection was high, with 85% of infants with disseminated HSV infection and 50% of infants with encephalitis dying by one year of age. The morbidity in the survivors of multi-organ infection was also high, with up to 50% experiencing long-term neurological sequelae.
- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of antiviral agents in the treatment of neonatal HSV infections on mortality, progression of disease, and neurodevelopmental sequelae at approximately one year. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of antiviral agents on major complications associated with the use of these agents, including nephrotoxicity and bone marrow suppression.
- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (1996 - Nov 2008), EMBASE (1982 - Nov 2008), and reference lists of published trials.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antiviral therapy in infants less than one month of age with virologically proven HSV infection were included.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted and the analyses performed independently by two review authors. Studies were analyzed for methodological quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. All data were analyzed using RevMan 5.1. When possible, meta-analysis was performed to calculate typical relative risk.

### Valtrex [^114xpJS5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Clinical considerations

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: The risk of neonatal HSV infection varies from 30% to 50% for genital HSV acquired in late pregnancy (third trimester), whereas with HSV acquisition in early pregnancy, the risk of neonatal infection is about 1%. A primary herpes occurrence during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with neonatal chorioretinitis, microcephaly, and, in rare cases, skin lesions. In very rare cases, transplacental transmission can occur, resulting in congenital infection, including microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and stillbirth. Co-infection with HSV increases the risk of perinatal HIV transmission in women who had a clinical diagnosis of genital herpes during pregnancy.
- **Data**: Human data from several decades with valacyclovir and its metabolite, acyclovir, in pregnant women, based on published literature, have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects. There are insufficient data on the use of valacyclovir regarding miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

	- The Acyclovir and the Valacyclovir Pregnancy Registries, both population-based international prospective studies, collected pregnancy data through April 1999. The Acyclovir Registry documented outcomes of 1,246 infants and fetuses exposed to acyclovir during pregnancy (756 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 197 during the second trimester, 291 during the third trimester, and 2 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects during first-trimester exposure…

### Congenital herpes simplex virus infection: Two unique cutaneous presentations associated with probable intrauterine transmission [^117HzWmG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations of congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been classically described as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. We report two cases of HSV infection wherein both infants presented at birth with widespread erosions and an absence of vesicles or vesicopustules. The presence of skin lesions at birth, neurologic changes seen on radiographic imaging, and a cesarean section delivery in one case suggests intrauterine transmission in both neonates.

### Disseminated neonatal herpes caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^1132UUuQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Disseminated neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is characterized by progressive multiple organ failure and high mortality rates. It can result from infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2. We report a case of disseminated neonatal herpes that was caused by both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

### Uncommon acute neuroimaging findings in severe neonatal herpes simplex virus 2 and consequences of delayed diagnosis [^112CR2hB]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is an emergency that can have devastating structural consequences and clinical outcomes. As it presents non-specifically in neonates, it is difficult to rapidly diagnose without neuroimaging. Although once thought to cause widespread parenchymal destruction, neonatal CNS HSV infection may present with more focal parenchymal injury on neuroimaging, not involving the medial temporal lobes as in adults. We report a case of a three-week-old girl with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) encephalitis with exclusive bilateral corticospinal and frontal opercular involvement, which remained undiagnosed and untreated until three months of age. Neuroimaging upon presentation to the emergency room demonstrates a highly suggestive pattern of severe neonatal CNS HSV-2 infection, which followed the natural history on subsequent imaging. This highlights the importance of emergency neuroimaging as well as maintaining a high index of suspicion for making the diagnosis.

### Evaluation of systemic inflammatory responses in neonates with herpes simplex virus infection [^111bxSea]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a severe disease with high mortality and morbidity. To investigate the pathogenesis of neonatal HSV infection, we examined inflammatory responses and markers of apoptosis in patients with neonatal HSV infection. Concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and markers of apoptosis were significantly higher in patients with disseminated HSV infection and were correlated with HSV load. It appears that the immunopathological damage resulting from host responses to viral infection leads to organ dysfunction in patients with neonatal HSV infection.

### A report of three cases and review of intrauterine herpes simplex virus infection [^112q6zk2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Intrauterine herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is often omitted from descriptions of neonatal HSV disease. Previous characterizations of intrauterine HSV infection limit manifestations to the triad of cutaneous, central nervous system (CNS), and ophthalmologic findings. We report three cases of intrauterine HSV infection and provide a contemporary literature review of this disease.
- **Methods**: Cases published between 1963 and January 2009 were identified. Selected cases fit the clinical description of intrauterine HSV infection, had manifestations present at birth, and had virologic confirmation of infection.
- **Results**: This review yielded 64 cases of intrauterine HSV infection, three of which were our own. Less than one-third fit the typical triad. Of the patients with cutaneous findings at birth, 24 (44%) had manifestations other than vesicles or bullae. Confirmation of HSV infection by culture of cutaneous lesions present at birth was delayed beyond 72 hours after birth in 15 patients and occurred at a median of 10 days of age. Nine of these patients had lesions at birth that were neither vesicles nor bullae, and 14 cases were confirmed by culture of new vesicles.
- **Conclusions**: More than two-thirds of reported cases do not present with the typical triad. Cutaneous findings are not limited to vesicles or bullae. A high index of suspicion and recognition of varied cutaneous manifestations is necessary to diagnose infants with intrauterine HSV infection.

### Neonatal herpes infection: Case report and discussion [^113suaqc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are often life-threatening. Although sometimes difficult to diagnose, most infections can be treatable when found early. Infection with HSV should be a primary consideration in the differential diagnosis of a febrile newborn younger than 1 month old, and treatment should be strongly considered for infants with certain risk factors, even before definitive culture or polymerase chain reaction results are available. The case presented here exemplifies the benefits of maintaining a high suspicion of, and empirically treating for, HSV in a 10-day-old febrile infant.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV: Herpes simplex virus [^112jk7Sr]. Department of Health and Human Services (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, especially in patients with HIV (pediatric patients), the CDC/HIVMA/IDSA/NIH 2018 guidelines recommend the administration of oral anti-HSV drugs, preferably valacyclovir and famciclovir, to shorten the duration and reduce the severity of non-severe HSV infections in pediatric and adolescent patients with HIV.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^113RYdQR]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: To generate estimates of incident neonatal herpes cases worldwide, our starting point was the latest WHO global and regional estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 prevalence and incidence among women, conducted in 2012 and published in 2015. These estimates were informed by comprehensive literature reviews conducted through February 2014, with full details of the search strategy, methods, and results reported in the corresponding papers.

After applying live birth rates by maternal age group for each WHO region from 2010 to 2015, we determined estimates of prevalent and incident maternal HSV infections during pregnancy. We then applied published risks of neonatal transmission based on whether the maternal infection was incident or prevalent and whether it was type 1 or type 2. This allowed us to generate annual numbers of incident neonatal infections according to the following equation:

- **N (a) HSV-s**: The annual number of incident neonatal HSV infections corresponding to maternal year of age a due to HSV type s, where s = 1 or 2.
- **B (a)**: The annual number of live births at maternal age a.
- **F (a) HSV-s**: The proportion of women with prevalent HSV-s infection at age a.
- **r prev_HSV-s**: The per-birth risk of neonatal infection from a prevalent maternal HSV-s infection.
- **k HSV-s**: The maximum proportion of women expected to be infected with HSV-s over a lifetime of exposure.
- **λ HSV-s**: The incidence of HSV-s infection per year among uninfected women.
- **x HSV-s**: The average number of days between HSV-s infection and the development of protective IgG antibodies (i.e. the window).

This methodology provides a structured approach to estimating neonatal herpes infections on a global and regional scale.

### Disseminated neonatal herpes caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^114uwFRg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Disseminated neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is characterized by progressive multiple organ failure and high mortality rates. It can result from infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2. We report a case of disseminated neonatal herpes that was caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^113WEMV4]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes is a rare but potentially devastating condition with an estimated 60% fatality rate without treatment. Transmission usually occurs during delivery from mothers with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) genital infection. However, the global burden has never been quantified to our knowledge. We developed a novel methodology for burden estimation and present the first WHO global and regional estimates of the annual number of neonatal herpes cases during 2010–2015.
- **Methods**: We applied previous estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 prevalence and incidence in women aged 15–49 years to 2010–2015 birth rates to estimate infections during pregnancy. We then applied published risks of neonatal HSV transmission according to whether maternal infection was incident or prevalent with HSV-1 or HSV-2 to generate annual numbers of incident neonatal infections. We estimated the number of incident neonatal infections by maternal age, and we generated separate estimates for each WHO region, which were then summed to obtain global estimates of the number of neonatal herpes infections.
- **Findings**: Globally, the overall rate of neonatal herpes was estimated to be about ten cases per 100,000 live births, equivalent to a best estimate of approximately 14,000 cases annually (4,000 for HSV-1 and 10,000 for HSV-2). We estimated that most neonatal herpes cases occurred in Africa, due to high maternal HSV-2 infection and high birth rates. HSV-1 contributed more cases than HSV-2 in the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific.

### Congenital herpes simplex virus in the newborn: A diagnostic dilemma [^1151DcUF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Although congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare, it is associated with severe morbidity. We report a 36-week gestational age infant who presented with atypical skin lesions, presumably mitigated by exposure to maternal antiviral suppressive therapy. The initial absence of typical herpetic vesicles and lack of viral detection in skin lesions delayed the correct diagnosis, highlighting the importance of differentiating HSV from other neonatal rashes.

### Sequential changes in pathophysiology of systemic inflammatory response in a disseminated neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection [^113BFEso]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Disseminated neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection causes a typical systemic inflammatory response syndrome and has a high mortality rate. However, the validity of anti-inflammatory intervention against this condition remains unknown.
- **Objectives**: We sought to demonstrate the sequential changes in the pathophysiology of disseminated neonatal HSV infections.
- **Study design**: The HSV serum copy number as well as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and cytochrome c concentrations, which predict the severity and mortality rate of sepsis, were sequentially evaluated in a patient with disseminated neonatal HSV infection caused by HSV-2.
- **Results**: As the patient presented with evidence of hyper-inflammation and severe illness, we empirically undertook anti-inflammatory intervention that included the administration of prednisolone, high-dose immunoglobulin, and blood exchange therapy in addition to high-dose acyclovir (ACV) therapy. The patient survived without significant neurological sequela. We found that (1) the serum concentrations of both HMGB1 and cytochrome c were extremely high, (2) temporal increases in these biomarkers were observed after admission, and (3) interestingly, the increase in HMGB1 level preceded that of cytochrome c. These results suggested that the pathophysiology of this condition changed sequentially in a dramatic manner, and the timing of our anti-inflammatory intervention was prior to the transition of pathological status from hyper-inflammation to massive apoptosis.
- **Conclusions**: Anti-inflammatory intervention may only be effective if initiated early in the disease course.

### Murine model of maternal immunization demonstrates protective role for antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in protecting neonates from herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 [^113qGJgv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease results in unacceptable morbidity and mortality. The primary humoral immune response to natural infection is neutralizing antibodies (Abs). However, Abs that activate Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) may play a dominant role in protection. In adult mice, a single-cycle HSV candidate vaccine deleted in glycoprotein-D (ΔgD-2) that induces ADCC provided complete protection against HSV disease and prevented the establishment of latency. Passive transfer studies showed that Abs were sufficient for protection. The study tested the hypothesis that maternal immunization with ΔgD-2 would protect neonates.
- **Methods**: C57BL/6 female mice were vaccinated 3 weeks apart with ΔgD-2, and pups were challenged at different times postnatally with lethal doses of HSV-1 or HSV-2. Concentration and functionality of Abs and immune cells were assessed.
- **Results**: Maternal ΔgD-2 immunization provided significant protection and reduced viral dissemination after lethal challenge with HSV-1 or HSV-2. Protection correlated with Abs acquired transplacentally or from breastmilk that mediated ADCC. Protection was reduced when pups were challenged on Day 1 of life, and this was associated with a decreased ability of newborn cells to mediate Ab-dependent cell killing.
- **Conclusions**: Antibodies mediating ADCC provide significant protection against neonatal HSV.

### Guidance on management of asymptomatic neonates born to women with active genital herpes lesions [^117GVbR8]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the neonate is uncommon, but genital herpes infections in adults are very common. Thus, although treating an infant with neonatal herpes is a relatively rare occurrence, managing infants potentially exposed to HSV at the time of delivery occurs more frequently. The risk of transmitting HSV to an infant during delivery is determined in part by the mother's previous immunity to HSV. Women with primary genital HSV infections who are shedding HSV at delivery are 10 to 30 times more likely to transmit the virus to their newborn infants than are women with recurrent HSV infection who are shedding virus at delivery.

With the availability of commercial serological tests that reliably can distinguish type-specific HSV antibodies, it is now possible to determine the type of maternal infection and thus further refine management of infants delivered to women who have active genital HSV lesions. The management algorithm presented here uses both serological and virological studies to determine the risk of HSV transmission to the neonate who is delivered to a mother with active herpetic genital lesions, and tailors management accordingly. The algorithm does not address the approach to asymptomatic neonates delivered to women with a history of genital herpes but no active lesions at delivery.

### Detection of herpes simplex virus DNA in dried blood spots making a retrospective diagnosis possible [^114ueNmb]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in neonates are associated with life-threatening disease. Early diagnosis and treatment with antiviral therapy have decreased the morbidity, mortality, and long-term sequelae in surviving children. The aim of the study was to investigate if herpes simplex virus DNA detection in dried blood spots on filter papers (Guthrie cards) sampled for screening of metabolic diseases may contribute to early diagnosis of neonatal HSV infection and enable pre-emptive therapy.
- **Methods**: For detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA, two different DNA extraction methods were evaluated. A minimal essential medium (MEM) extraction method was found superior and was used in combination with detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA by PCR in dried blood spots from children with verified neonatal HSV infection. Cards from 28 children were included. The onset of illness varied from day 0 to 42 days and was the result of different types of maternal infection (27 cases) and an external source (one case).
- **Results**: HSV DNA was detected in seven of the 28 Guthrie cards; two were HSV-1 and five were HSV-2 DNA positive. Positive dried blood spot cards were sampled within the interval of 5 days before to 6 days after the onset of neonatal herpes. In cases of late-onset CNS disease, viremia was not demonstrable at the age of 3–5 days, the time period when the blood spot cards are normally sampled.
- **Conclusion**: Viremia, the prerequisite for demonstrating HSV DNA in dried blood spot cards, preceded the onset of illness by up to 5 days and lasted at least up to 6 days thereafter.

### Disseminated herpes simplex virus infection and capillary leak syndrome in preterm twins [^116aUnXw]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be life-threatening in neonates without treatment. We present a case involving twins diagnosed with disseminated HSV who experienced different clinical courses. Twin A was more severely affected, developing severe capillary leak syndrome (CLS) that led to cardiovascular compromise, acute kidney injury, and hepatic failure. However, with innovative immunologic treatment and expert hemodynamic management, the patient recovered despite high mortality in infants with this presentation. Twin B had a less severe initial presentation but experienced long-term neurologic sequelae, including keratitis of both eyes occurring at different times and reHSV meningitis. This case report displays novel translational and clinical methods that may improve survival in neonates with severe disseminated HSV and CLS.

### Comparison of clinical manifestations, outcomes and cerebrospinal fluid findings between herpes simplex type 1 and type 2 central nervous system infections in adults [^112GYB4H]. Journal of Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

In previous reports on the viral causes of central nervous system (CNS) infections, it has been generally recognized that HSV-1 is a major cause of encephalitis, while HSV-2 is the predominant cause of aseptic meningitis in adults. To examine this matter, the clinical characteristics in the two types of HSV CNS infections were investigated.

In a retrospective cohort study, which included all adult patients (≥ 16 years) between January 1999 and December 2013 in a 2,700-bed tertiary care hospital, all the patients in whom PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSV was positive were identified. Ninety-five patients with positive CSF PCR results for HSV were included: 21 with HSV-1 and 74 with HSV-2.

- **Clinical findings**:
	- Many patients with HSV-1 had encephalitis (13/21, 61.9%), whereas most patients with HSV-2 had meningitis (62/74, 83.8%). However, HSV-1 and HSV-2 accounted for a similar proportion of patients with HSV encephalitis (13/25, 52.0% vs. 12/25, 48.0%).
- **Neurological sequelae**:
	- Neurological sequelae were more frequent among patients with HSV-1 (9/21, 42.9% vs. 6/74, 8.1%; P = 0.001).

The present study suggests that HSV-2 is not only a major cause of aseptic meningitis but also may cause serious manifestations, similar to HSV-1 encephalitis in adults.

### Maternal and neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^113tqb8j]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Genital herpes infections are extremely common worldwide, with approximately 22% of pregnant women infected with the herpes simplex virus. A significant 80% of those affected with genital herpes are unaware of their infection. The most devastating consequence of maternal genital herpes is neonatal herpes disease. Fortunately, neonatal herpes simplex infections are uncommon; however, due to the associated morbidity and mortality, they are often considered in the differential diagnosis of ill neonates.

Use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the diagnosis of central nervous system infections and the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy have revolutionized the diagnosis and management of these infants. Most recently, the initiation of long-term antiviral suppressive therapy in these infants has led to significant improvement in morbidity.

This review summarizes the epidemiology of maternal and neonatal herpes infections and discusses clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of infants with neonatal herpes disease.

### Major brain lesions by intrauterine herpes simplex virus infection: MRI contribution [^113YM1fr]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are acquired at birth due to direct fetal contact with the infected birth canal or through an ascending infection after premature rupture of the amniotic membranes. Intrauterine transmission of HSV infection from mother to fetus is rare; it occurs in only 5% of cases through hematogenous transplacental dissemination. We present a case of transplacental intrauterine HSV infection following primary maternal HSV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy.

The diagnosis was confirmed by viral culture and serologic tests. Ultrasound imaging in the third trimester revealed fetal brain damage. Subsequently, an MRI demonstrated the devastating extensiveness of the HSV infection, which was beyond expectations based on the ultrasound images.

### Laboratory diagnosis of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^114NbMdv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common and often benign infection in humans; although it less commonly affects newborns, infection in this age group can be devastating. Newborns often present with nonspecific clinical findings, making timely and accurate diagnosis of infection critical. A wide variety of tests are available for detecting herpes simplex virus infection, but only a subset are useful and validated in the newborn population. The review summarizes available diagnostic testing for neonatal disease, discussing limitations, unmet needs, and emerging data on molecular testing methods.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^112pQzDs]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

The number and rate of neonatal herpes is sensitive to the assumed risks of neonatal herpes from a maternal infection (HSV-1 versus HSV-2; incident versus prevalent infection), reflecting the underlying uncertainty in the values attached to these risks. The variation in numbers of cases and rates between the lowest and highest assumed values was an order of magnitude of approximately 10. When the lowest values were used across all assumptions, the total annual number of cases of neonatal herpes globally during 2010–2015 was estimated to be 3,703 (2.7 cases per 100,000 births), and when the highest values were used across all assumptions, the total annual number of cases worldwide in 2010–2015 was estimated to be 36,415 (26.3 cases per 100,000 births).

### The assessment of IgG avidity in the evaluation of perinatal herpes simplex virus infection [^111nnSAz]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Classical serologic assays are not useful for the diagnosis of perinatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during the acute phase of the disease. We report two cases of neonatal HSV infection that highlight the diagnostic value of HSV-specific IgG avidity and its contribution to the further characterization of neonatal HSV infection.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^1174jUvi]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Globally, the annual number of incident neonatal herpes cases during 2010–2015 was estimated to be 14,257, of which approximately two-thirds (9,911 cases) were due to HSV-2, and one-third (4,346 cases) due to HSV-1. The global rate of neonatal herpes, when averaged across all regions, was estimated to be 10.3 per 100,000 births.

Our results showed that Africa contributed the largest number (around one-third) of neonatal herpes cases to the global total. This was a consequence of the much higher incidence and prevalence of adult female HSV-2 infection in this region, combined with a high number of births. Our calculations showed that HSV-1 is currently not a significant cause of neonatal herpes in Africa. This is based on available data showing a high modeled rate of (oral) HSV-1 infection during childhood and saturation in prevalence by adolescence at almost 100% prevalence in Africa, thus removing the potential for further genital HSV-1 infection in adulthood. HSV-1 does not seem to be a significant cause of neonatal herpes in South-East Asia either, again based on available data which seem to show saturation in HSV-1 prevalence by adolescence, although the modeled level of saturation is much lower than in Africa.

In contrast, HSV-1 was estimated to cause more neonatal herpes cases than HSV-2 in the Americas, as well as in Europe and the Western Pacific.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Epidemiology and outcomes in the modern era [^1158v5Wf]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades, there have been advances in diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease. However, there has been no recent comprehensive evaluation of the impact of these advances on the management and outcomes for neonates with HSV.
- **Methods**: Clinical data for initial presentation, treatment, and outcomes were abstracted from medical records of neonates with HSV treated at Seattle Children's Hospital between 1980 and 2016.
- **Results**: One hundred thirty infants with a diagnosis of neonatal HSV were identified. Between 1980 and 2016, high-dose acyclovir treatment for neonatal HSV infection increased from 0% to close to 95%, with a subsequent decrease in overall HSV-related mortality from 20.9% to 5.6%. However, even among infants treated with high-dose acyclovir, mortality was 40.9% for infants with disseminated (DIS) disease, and only 55% of infants with central nervous system (CNS) disease were without obvious neurologic abnormalities at 24 months. Over the study period, the time between initial symptoms and diagnosis decreased. Skin recurrences were more common with HSV-2 than HSV-1 (80% vs. 55%; p = 0.02) and in infants with lesions at initial diagnosis (76% vs. 47%; p = 0.02).
- **Conclusion**: Changes in the standard of care for management of neonatal HSV disease have led to improvements in the timeliness of diagnosis and outcomes; however, mortality in infants with DIS disease and neurologic morbidity in infants with CNS disease remain high. Future research should focus on prevention of perinatal infection and subsequent recurrences.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^115KFQwa]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

The occurrence of neonatal herpes has been difficult to quantify, and the worldwide annual number of cases has never been estimated. Most countries do not require case reporting of neonatal herpes infections, although a few areas have implemented active surveillance efforts for neonatal herpes. Prospective cohort studies to measure incidence have been conducted only rarely. Without estimates of the numbers of cases of neonatal herpes occurring each year, it is challenging to raise awareness of this devastating infection. In addition, global estimates are crucial for stimulating efforts to develop HSV vaccines, microbicides, and improved diagnostics and treatment, and modeling more precisely their potential benefits. Therefore, we present the first set of World Health Organization (WHO) global estimates of the annual number of incident cases of neonatal herpes infection from HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection in mothers aged 15–49 years during 2010–2015.

### Maternal immunization confers protection against neonatal herpes simplex mortality and behavioral morbidity [^115EZqkB]. Science Translational Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) infections cause devastating morbidity and mortality in infants. Most nHSV cases are associated with primary maternal infection, consistent with the hypothesis that maternal immunity is protective. In humans, we found HSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in newborns of immune mothers, indicating that placentally transferred HSV-specific antibody is protective. Using a murine model, we showed that passive administration of HSV-specific antibody to dams prevented disseminated infection and mortality in pups.

Maternal immunization with an HSV-2 replication-defective vaccine candidate, dL 5–29, led to transfer of HSV-specific antibodies into neonatal circulation that protected against nHSV neurological disease and death. Furthermore, we observed considerable anxiety-like behavior in adult mice that had been infected with low doses of HSV as neonates, despite a notable lack of signs of infection. This phenotype suggests that nHSV infection can have an unsuspected and permanent impact on behavior. These behavioral sequelae of nHSV were prevented by maternal immunization with dL 5–29, demonstrating an unexpected benefit of immunization.

These findings also support the general concept that maternal immunization can prevent neurotropic neonatal infections and associated morbidity and mortality.

### Role of NLRC3 in modulating inflammatory responses in neonates [^112EkNEU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

To elucidate the differences in inflammatory responses between neonates and adults, we compared the production of inflammatory cytokines in neonatal and adult peripheral blood stimulated with LPS alone or LPS plus HSV-60 DNA in vitro. HSV-60 DNA is a 60 bp oligonucleotide containing a viral DNA motif derived from the genome of HSV type 1 (HSV-1), which exhibits the biological functions of HSV-1. Previous reports have indicated that NLRC3 can recognize the double-stranded DNA of HSV-1 with high affinity. Furthermore, upon binding to HSV-1 DNA, NLRC3 is specifically activated; once activated, NLRC3 can inhibit the release of downstream inflammatory factors by suppressing proteasome components such as IKK, ASC, and TRAF.

Kollmann et al. observed that neonatal blood produces significantly lower levels of both TNF-α and IL-6 than adult blood when stimulated with LPS, which is suggestive of impaired inflammatory responses in neonates. Thus, we utilized whole blood stimulation to simulate the inflammatory response following bacterial infection and observed that following LPS stimulation, preterm and full-term infants produced significantly lower levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β when compared with adults. Moreover, following stimulation with a mixture of LPS and HSV-60 DNA, there was no significant difference in the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β among preterm infants, full-term infants, and adults. Notably, post-stimulation with the LPS and HSV-60 DNA mixture, the adults exhibited markedly reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β release when compared with neonates.

### The role of toll-like receptors in herpes simplex infection in neonates [^114xMAKe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their associated signal-transducing proteins on the surface of cells have been shown to account for most, if not all, events associated with bacterial sepsis. Using human cells expressing different TLRs, we demonstrated that the interaction between TLR2 and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1–2 leads to the production of cytokines.

Using peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, we tested the ability of cells from people of different age groups to produce cytokines in response to HSV. An examination of the host responses of neonates to HSV indicates that, rather than producing less interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to HSV than adults do, neonates produce more of these cytokines than adults. This may explain the sepsis syndrome observed with HSV and other virus infections in neonates.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of disseminated herpes simplex virus infection in neonates [^115ZvwUn]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is the most fulminant type of neonatal HSV infection and carries the highest mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival. We describe the clinical presentation, laboratory characteristics, and outcomes of neonates with disseminated HSV infection at our institution.
- **Methods**: A retrospective review of electronic medical records from 2006 to 2013 was performed. Only neonates with disseminated HSV infection, confirmed by using polymerase chain reaction or viral culture results, were included.
- **Results**: Twenty-two cases were identified; the age range was 1 to 14 days. The majority of patients did not have a maternal history of HSV or a history of maternal fever at delivery. Eleven of the patients were delivered by cesarean delivery, and 3 of these patients did not have prolonged rupture of membranes. Neonatal fever, the most common historical characteristic, was present in only one-half of the patients. Pneumonia and respiratory distress were present in one-half of the patients. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated in most, but not all, patients. The blood HSV polymerase chain reaction was positive in all patients tested. Of the 22 study patients, 16 survived and 6 died. The majority of the patients who died had respiratory disease and a delay in the initiation of acyclovir therapy.
- **Conclusions**: Disseminated HSV infection in neonates can be challenging to diagnose and is associated with high mortality. Clinicians must be diligent in recognizing and treating this condition promptly.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^116dAVuN]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections are uncommon, but because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection, they are often considered in the differential diagnosis of ill neonates. The use of polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of central nervous system infections and the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of these infants. The initiation of long-term antiviral suppressive therapy in these infants has led to a significant improvement in morbidity.

### Lower-limb hypoplasia due to intrauterine infection with herpes simplex virus type 2: Possible confusion with intrauterine varicella-zoster syndrome [^117VhpsQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

A neonate with lower-limb hypoplasia, cutaneous scars, bilateral chorioretinitis, and multiple brain abnormalities is presented. Intrauterine herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection was established on the basis of serological testing of the mother and viral cultures of the child's cutaneous lesions, obtained soon after birth. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a patient with in utero-acquired HSV-2 infection presenting with limb hypoplasia. It illustrates that, in addition to congenital varicella-zoster syndrome, HSV-2 infection should also be considered in patients presenting with limb hypoplasia.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^1139tzwc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Many infections result from asymptomatic cervical shedding of the virus following a primary episode of genital HSV in the third trimester. Antibodies to HSV-2 have been detected in approximately 20 percent of pregnant women, but only 5 percent report a history of symptomatic infection. All primary episodes of HSV and secondary episodes near term or at the time of delivery should be treated with antiviral therapy. If active HSV infection is present at the time of delivery, a cesarean section should be performed. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants.

The diagnosis of neonatal HSV can be difficult, but it should be suspected in any newborn with irritability, lethargy, fever, or poor feeding at one week of age. Diagnosis is made by culturing the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and fluid from eyes, nose, and mucous membranes. All newborns suspected to have or diagnosed with HSV infection should be treated with parenteral acyclovir.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^117FRb4s]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

In our case, we believed the most likely diagnosis was going to be HSV nipple infection. The classic presentation of an HSV nipple infection reveals a crusted nipple with miniature vesicles on an erythematous base that is very tender to touch and typically limited to the nipple or areola. Extensive erythema or skin changes outside the areola are not common. Our patient had a single vertical fissure through her right nipple.

The nipple fissure, grouped vesicular lesions on her left hand, and disseminated neonatal infection of her twins raised suspicion for either maternal to neonatal HSV transmission or the converse. We believed it unlikely that another HHV infection was responsible for the grouped maternal lesions and illness of the neonates due to other HHV infections not presenting with grouped vesicular lesions. In addition, there were no suspicious findings on antepartum ultrasound showing any signs of congenital infections prior to birth and no other highly suspicious findings on examination or lab values of the neonates.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^113nTJXZ]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

**Results**: Findings from previous HSV estimates relevant to neonatal herpes cases are presented in additional tables (Table S1 and Table S2). Table S1 summarizes the number of studies contributing to the female estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection in earlier papers, categorized by WHO region and 5-year age-band, and individual countries reporting HSV-1 or HSV-2 prevalence to inform these estimates. Studies may be represented for more than one age group, and those reporting HSV-2 often reported HSV-1. Table S2 illustrates the estimated prevalence and incidence of HSV-2, any HSV-1, and genital HSV-1 infection in women in 2012, as found in prior research. Globally, among the 139 million live births to women aged 15–49 years each year on average during 2010–2015, approximately 24 million births were to women with either prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection during pregnancy. Additionally, 108 million births were to women with either prevalent or incident HSV-1 infection (at any site) during pregnancy, some of which — specifically those in dually-infected mothers — are included in the HSV-2 infection statistics.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^117CRwBo]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Our global estimated neonatal herpes rate of 10.3 per 100,000 births is consistent with recent estimates from North America, Europe, and Australia using surveillance and administrative data, which have ranged from 2.5 to 13.3 per 100,000 live births. The global number of cases we estimated is similar to what would be expected if neonatal herpes rates from the largest recent population-based estimates from USA hospital discharge data (9.6 per 100,000 births) were applied to global births. Our higher estimated rate of 19.9 cases per 100,000 births for the Americas may reflect the challenges of retrospective reviews and difficulty capturing all cases for a condition that has not always had a single clear diagnosis code, and the overall uncertainty inherent in our estimates. A rate of 30.8 per 100,000 live births was found in the only large multi-centre prospective study of neonatal herpes acquisition, which was the study that informed our underlying neonatal transmission risks. Globally, comparisons with other region-specific rates are made difficult by a general lack of data with regard to neonatal herpes.
- **Potential for underestimation in resource-poor settings**: These global neonatal herpes estimates provide a starting point for understanding the burden of neonatal herpes worldwide; however, it is likely that we have underestimated the numbers of cases in resource-poor settings. Our estimates rely heavily on data from the United States for parameterizing transmission risks. We used numbers from a large, multi-centre prospective study in the United States on the effect of maternal HS.

### Intrauterine herpes simplex infection [^111rqBQd]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is usually acquired at birth. We present an infant with intrauterine HSV infection, acquired after the rupture of membranes. The infant was born prematurely to a woman experiencing her first episode of genital herpetic infection early in pregnancy, with membrane rupture occurring 11 days prior to delivery. At delivery, the infant exhibited extensive brain damage, hemorrhage, and cystic encephalomalacia due to the herpes infection. On the second day of life, magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the hemorrhage had occurred 7 to 14 days before the scan, and the placental pathology supported an ascending infection. This case of an ascending herpetic intrauterine infection following membrane rupture raises questions about prevention and the potential for suppressive antiviral therapy.

### Acyclovir [^113BK9fh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of acyclovir were evaluated for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infection in neonates and infants. In one study (Study 1), acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (30 mg/kg/day) was compared with vidarabine. In a follow-up study (Study 2), acyclovir 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (60 mg/kg/day) was compared with acyclovir 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (45 mg/kg/day).

Study 2 was an open-label clinical trial with the objective of establishing the safety and efficacy of acyclovir 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (45 mg/kg/day) or 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (60 mg/kg/day) administered to neonates ≤ 28 days old with suspected HSV infection. Neonates aged ≤ 28 days with suspected HSV infection were eligible for enrollment. A total of 88 neonates were enrolled in the trial and received IV acyclovir for 21 days. Of the 88 subjects, 69 had confirmed systemic disease, 10 had confirmed localized disease, and 9 had suspected but unconfirmed infection. Among the 79 subjects with confirmed infection, 13 received 45 mg/kg/day and 66 received 60 mg/kg/day. The mean gestational ages (GA) were 37.5 and 37.9 weeks for the 45-mg/kg/day and 60-mg/kg/day doses, respectively. The number of premature infants (≤ 37 weeks GA) receiving 45 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day was 7 (54%) and 22 (33%), respectively.

Among 69 patients with proven systemic (disseminated or CNS) herpes infection, 57 were randomized to receive acyclovir (20 mg/kg every 8 hours) while the remaining 12 patients received a lower dose of acyclovir every 8 hours. Overall, the mortality…

### Herpes simplex virus infection in young infants during 2 decades of empiric acyclovir therapy [^1119LYhY]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical presentation of HSV-infected young infants and to seek distinctive features that could permit a targeted approach to empiric use of acyclovir, a case study was conducted. This study focused on neonatal HSV over a 22-year period within an institutional strategy of consistently using acyclovir empirically in all infants with illness onset at ≤ 21 days of age, where antibiotics were given empirically. Multiple sources were utilized to optimize HSV case data and estimate the rate of HSV infection in empirically treated infants.

A total of 32 infants with perinatally acquired HSV infection were identified, all of whom received acyclovir empirically at admission. At presentation, 50% of infants had only nonspecific complaints, with fever being present in 75%. After testing, 75% of infants with HSV had central nervous system (CNS) infection. This included 40% who presented with mucocutaneous lesions, 83% with seizures, and 94% with nonspecific complaints. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction confirmed CNS infection in 16 of 22 (73%) patients tested. Cultures of mucocutaneous lesions yielded HSV in 8 of 10 cases, but cultures of CSF were negative in all 26 cases tested. Screening cultures of unaffected mucosal sites were the only HSV-confirmatory test in a single patient.

Laboratory and CSF findings were not distinctive in patients with HSV. The age of ≤ 21 days at the onset of symptoms captured 90% of all infants with HSV and 94% of those with nonspecific complaints. An estimated 1.3% of empirically treated patients had HSV infection.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^112UATLx]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

An effective new vaccine or microbicide developed against genital herpes in adults could have an important and needed benefit in preventing neonatal herpes. Recent scientific advances hold real promise for new HSV vaccine development. The primary targets of such vaccines are the prevention of painful genital ulcer disease (GUD) in tens of millions of adults, reduction in the negative impact on sexual relationships, and reduction in the increased HIV risk associated with genital HSV infection. Estimates suggest that HSV is not a major contributor within the scope of all conditions affecting neonatal health, although its impact may be considerably underappreciated in some settings. However, if a vaccine or microbicide in adults could indirectly reduce neonatal transmission, this would not only expand the reach of these interventions but also partly mitigate the difficulties in preventing this condition through existing management.

Moreover, the high mortality and long-term disability in surviving infants due to neonatal herpes could translate into a considerable number of disability-adjusted life years and costs that could be prevented with a vaccine despite low incidence. These global estimates provide a first insight into the potential magnitude of this added benefit. Better primary data on neonatal herpes, particularly in low-resource settings, will help define more precisely the potential global health impact of critically needed new primary prevention measures against HSV infection.

### Herpes simplex virus infections of the newborn [^1149jPRD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are fortunately quite rare in the neonatal population. Nevertheless, due to their life-threatening nature and the tremendous damage that surviving infants can incur, neonatal HSV is actually considered in a differential diagnosis relatively commonly. The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy for the management of neonatal HSV can also accelerate a clinician's decision to consider HSV as the cause of a neonate's disease presentation, and then to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies and empirically institute antiviral treatment.

Decisions on whether to continue antiviral therapy for a full course are predicated on the appropriate interpretation of these diagnostic studies as they subsequently are reported to the treating physician. For HSV-infected neonates, the duration of parenteral acyclovir therapy ranges from 14 to 21 days, depending on the extent of disease. The use of subsequent oral suppressive antiviral therapy is under investigation in randomized controlled trials, and at this time cannot be routinely recommended. This article summarizes the state of neonatal HSV disease presentation, diagnosis, and management.

### Fetal and neonatal abnormalities due to congenital herpes simplex virus infection: a literature review [^113UHEcq]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during pregnancy can cause severe neonatal infections and is a rare cause of congenital infections. This study aimed to describe fetal and neonatal abnormalities associated with congenital HSV infection, to define features accessible to prenatal diagnosis during ultrasound screening and work-up for congenital malformations.
- **Methods**: The study analyzed all cases of congenital HSV infection (CHI) described before and/or after birth and identified in PubMed. Findings were classified based on their accessibility to prenatal diagnosis.
- **Results**: Thirty-six cases of congenital herpes infection were reported, with 15 described prenatally and 21 postnatally. The most frequently reported malformations accessible to prenatal diagnosis were cerebral anomalies. The most common abnormalities described after birth were skin lesions and keratitis, which are not considered amenable to prenatal ultrasound detection. CHI can be due to either HSV1 or HSV2 infection, whether primary or non-primary, with or without the presence of maternal symptoms.
- **Conclusion**: Prenatal ultrasound abnormalities due to CHI are rare, varied, and non-specific. There is no clear role for fetal ultrasound in the routine management of women with primary or non-primary HSV infection during pregnancy. However, in fetuses exhibiting ultrasound abnormalities suggestive of congenital infection, HSV should still be considered a differential diagnosis after excluding more common in utero infections, such as cytomegalovirus.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection [^117SnCa8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2 infections are highly prevalent worldwide and are characterized by establishing lifelong infection with periods of latency interspersed with periodic episodes of reactivation. Acquisition of HSV by an infant during the peripartum or postpartum period results in neonatal HSV disease, a rare but significant infection that can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality, especially if there is dissemination or central nervous system involvement. Diagnostic and therapeutic advances have led to improvements in mortality and, to a lesser extent, neurodevelopmental outcomes, but room exists for further improvement.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^114MnieG]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes is a rare but potentially devastating condition, with a 60% fatality rate without treatment. Transmission usually occurs during delivery from mothers with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or HSV-2 genital infection. The global burden has never been quantified. We developed a novel methodology for burden estimation and present the first WHO global and regional estimates of the annual number of neonatal herpes cases during 2010–2015.
- **Methods**: Previous estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 prevalence and incidence in women aged 15–49 years were applied to 2010–2015 birth rates to estimate infections during pregnancy. Published risks of neonatal HSV transmission were then applied according to whether maternal infection was incident or prevalent with HSV-1 or HSV-2 to estimate neonatal herpes cases.
- **Findings**: Globally, the overall rate of neonatal herpes was estimated to be approximately 10 cases per 100,000 births, equivalent to a best estimate of around 14,000 cases annually (HSV-1: ~4,000; HSV-2: ~10,000). We estimated that the most neonatal herpes cases occurred in Africa due to high maternal HSV-2 infection and high birth rates. HSV-1 contributed more cases than HSV-2 in the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific. High rates of genital HSV-1 infection and moderate HSV-2 prevalence meant the Americas had the highest overall rate. However, our estimates are highly sensitive to the core assumptions, and considerable uncertainty exists for many settings given sparse underlying data.
- **Interpretation**: These neonatal herpes estimates mark the first attempt to quantify the global burden of this condition.

### Atypical systemic neonatal herpes diagnosed incidentally in twin infants [^114RWSoW]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are serious infections that usually occur in the first few weeks of life. Infants generally present with mucocutaneous lesions, central nervous system infection, and/or systemic disease. In this case report, we describe a set of twins that had unexpected presentations of neonatal HSV. Twin A was diagnosed incidentally on routine eye exam, and Twin B was diagnosed only because his twin was found to be infected; both infants were still hospitalized and were beyond 1 month of age. These twins exhibited atypical manifestations that diverge from the three main categories of neonatal HSV and expand our understanding of the spectrum of disease.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^115cXrfQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Identifying active herpetic lesions of the breast in a lactating person is crucial, as this is a contraindication to breastfeeding. However, in patients with a prior history of HSV, direct breastfeeding is considered safe if there are no active lesions on the breast. For those who develop herpes nipple infections, there is limited data regarding the optimal treatment of the breast lesions and the timing for resuming breastfeeding. Mothers wishing to continue breastfeeding with an active herpes infection of the breast should maintain expressing/pumping and discarding the milk until the infection clears.

Here, we present the work-up and management of a primigravida in her 30s who presented to our institution's postpartum clinic approximately three weeks after delivery via low transverse caesarean section. She delivered dichorionic diamniotic twins at 33 weeks of gestation and reported a painful cracked nipple at this visit. She had no known history of HSV, but her twin neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) for disseminated HSV prior to the onset of visible maternal lesions.

### Atypical clinical features of a human herpesvirus-6 infection in a neonate [^113TFdPQ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

A case of neonatal human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) B infection is presented. Although HHV-6 B was isolated from peripheral blood at the onset of the illness, a significant increase in viral antibody titers was not observed. The patient had a slight fever with a generalized maculopapular skin rash and an increased number of atypical lymphocytes, which is quite different from the typical clinical features of exanthem subitum.

### Granulomatous herpes simplex encephalitis in an infant with multicystic encephalopathy: A distinct clinicopathologic entity [^111oL3ez]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus encephalitis can manifest as a range of clinical presentations, including classic adult, neonatal, and biphasic chronic-granulomatous herpes encephalitis.
- **Method**: We report an infant with granulomatous herpes simplex virus type 2 encephalitis with a subacute course and multicystic encephalopathy.
- **Case**: A 2-month-old girl presented with lethargy and hypothermia. A computed tomography scan of the head showed multicystic encephalopathy and calcifications. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis by polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus was negative. Normal cerebrospinal fluid interferon-α levels argued against Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. The patient died 2 weeks after presentation. At autopsy, multicystic encephalopathy was confirmed with bilateral gliosis, granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells, and calcifications. Bilateral healing necrotizing retinitis suggested a viral etiology, but the retina and brain were free of viral inclusions and immunohistochemically negative for herpes simplex virus-2 and cytomegalovirus. However, polymerase chain reaction analysis showed herpes simplex virus-2 DNA in four cerebral paraffin blocks. Subsequent repeat testing of the initial cerebrospinal fluid sample using a different polymerase chain reaction assay was weakly positive for herpes simplex virus-2 DNA.
- **Conclusion**: Granulomatous herpes simplex virus encephalitis in infants can present with a subacute course and result in multicystic encephalopathy with mineralization and minimal cerebrospinal fluid inflammation.

### The mortality of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection [^115dKP2o]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This retrospective study characterized the clinical course of 13 neonates who died with herpes simplex virus infection from 2001 to 2011, representing a 26% case-fatality rate. Fatal disease developed in one-third of infants at or before 48 hours of age. The disease was mostly disseminated and occurred despite the early administration of high-dose acyclovir therapy.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^111GLpbJ]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). High credibility.

This study represents the first attempt to quantify the global number of incident neonatal herpes cases. We estimated that each year during 2010–2015, there were over 14,000 cases of neonatal herpes arising from HSV infection in mothers aged 15–49 years worldwide (HSV-1: ~4,000; HSV-2: ~10,000), which is equivalent to an annual rate of neonatal herpes of 10.3 per 100,000 births. Our estimates of neonatal herpes cases are highly sensitive to the assumptions made. For example, the numbers of annual cases could be as low as ~4,000 or as high as ~36,000, if the lowest or highest plausible values for all components of neonatal transmission risk are applied. Nonetheless, these estimates enable us to gain a first insight into the global picture of neonatal herpes, to compare the burden of cases between regions, including the impact of HSV-1 versus HSV-2 and prevalent versus incident maternal infection, and to understand where further data collection is needed. For example, the Americas had the highest estimated regional rate of neonatal herpes, largely due to HSV-1 infection, which contributed two-thirds of cases to the regional total. This is consistent with recent surveillance data from Canada showing that HSV-1 caused 63% of neonatal herpes cases. By contrast, in Africa, virtually all cases were due to HSV-2, and high HSV-2 infection rates combined with high birth rates in this region led it to have the highest estimated number of cases globally.

### Management of neonates born to mothers with active genital herpes simplex virus infection: An alternative approach [^117RYRix]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Neonatal HSV infection, while considered rare, presents a significant need for preventive strategies due to its substantial impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality. This review explores the epidemiology of neonatal HSV infection and discusses guidance on managing asymptomatic neonates born to mothers with active genital HSV infection.

Recent findings indicate that timely detection and early administration of high-dose acyclovir can reduce mortality in neonatal HSV infection. All neonates born to mothers with active genital HSV infection during the third trimester or at delivery should be tested for HSV infection. Newborn management traditionally relies on whether the mother has experienced a primary or recurrent genital HSV infection, determined by maternal serologic testing and PCR testing of the genital lesion. However, an alternative management strategy is suggested, based on the type of maternal HSV infection and perinatal risk factors.

The incidence of neonatal HSV infection is on the rise, with more cases attributed to HSV-1 than HSV-2. The review also addresses guidance on the management of asymptomatic newborns exposed to active maternal genital HSV infection.

### Heterogeneous cutaneous findings associated with intrauterine HSV infection: A case series and literature review [^114EK79T]. Pediatric dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection acquired in utero may present with non-vesicular dermatologic findings in affected newborns, which may pose a diagnostic dilemma. We aimed to describe and assess the range of non-vesiculobullous skin lesions that neonates with intrauterine HSV infection may manifest at birth.
- **Methods**: We collected a multicenter case series and conducted a literature review of neonates with intrauterine HSV infection presenting with non-vesiculobullous cutaneous lesions.
- **Results**: Twenty-two cases were reviewed, including six managed clinically by members of our team and 16 identified in the literature. Four (18%) were associated with twin pregnancies, and thirteen (59%) cases occurred in premature infants. Only four (18%) mothers had a documented history of HSV infection. Twelve (55%) cases resulted in poor outcomes, including long-term neurologic sequelae or death. Cutaneous manifestations included erosions, ulcerations, crusted papules or plaques, calcinosis cutis, excoriations, macules (erythematous, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented), cutaneous atrophy, contractures, and bruising. About one-third of neonates developed new-onset vesicular lesions within a week of birth; in each of these cases, accurate diagnosis and therapy were delayed until the appearance of vesicles.
- **Conclusions**: The range of dermatologic findings associated with intrauterine HSV is extremely broad, and the various morphologies present at birth likely reflect different stages of the ongoing evolution of an HSV infection that began in utero. Clinicians should have…

### A case of non-disseminated herpes zoster as the presenting sign of HIV in a 3-year-old [^112TgUJs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Herpes zoster is rare in healthy and immunocompetent children. While disseminated presentations of zoster are often concerning for underlying immunodeficiency, non-disseminated zoster can also be a presenting illness in such patients. Here, we report a case of non-disseminated herpes zoster in a presumably healthy immunized child that led to a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

### Diagnosis and management of neonatal herpes simplex infection in the emergency department [^112NnALb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). High credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) is rare in neonates, with an estimated global incidence of 10 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal HSV is challenging to diagnose due to often vague signs and symptoms. Untreated, the mortality of some HSV subtypes exceeds 80%. Overtesting and overtreatment can result in prolonged hospitalizations and expose neonates to medication toxicity. In contrast, prompt evaluation and use of empiric antiviral therapy before the results of definitive testing can improve outcomes for infants with HSV. A wide degree of practice variation exists with respect to testing and treatment for neonatal HSV, and more research is required to safely risk-stratify this population. This review presents the epidemiology, risk factors, presenting features, and emergency department management of neonatal HSV infection.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection in neonates and young infants [^113UDL6W]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we reviewed the characteristics of infants less than 3 months of age with central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection at our institution. Twenty-six cases were identified, with an age range of 4 to 73 days. Most infants presented with fever, seizure activity, and skin lesions. The blood herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 91% of patients tested. Suppressive oral acyclovir therapy was likely helpful in preventing disease recurrence.

### Infant deaths due to herpes simplex virus, congenital syphilis, and HIV in New York City [^1127semD]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Neonatal infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is not a nationally reportable disease; there have been few population-based measures of HSV-related infant mortality. We describe infant death rates due to neonatal HSV as compared with congenital syphilis (CS) and HIV, two reportable, perinatally transmitted diseases, in New York City from 1981 to 2013.

- **Methods**: We identified neonatal HSV-, CS-, and HIV-related deaths using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes listed on certificates of death or stillbirth issued in New York City. Deaths were classified as HSV-related if certificates listed (1) any HSV ICD-9/ICD-10 codes for deaths ≤ 42 days of age, (2) any HSV ICD-9/ICD-10 codes and an ICD code for perinatal infection for deaths at 43 to 365 days of age, or (3) an ICD-10 code for congenital HSV. CS- and HIV-related deaths were those listing any ICD code for syphilis or HIV.

- **Results**: There were 34 deaths due to neonatal HSV (0.82 deaths per 100,000 live births), 38 from CS (0.92 per 100,000), and 262 from HIV (6.33 per 100,000). There were no CS-related deaths after 1996, and only 1 HIV-related infant death after 2004. The neonatal HSV-related death rate during the most recent decade (2004–2013) was significantly higher than in previous years.

- **Conclusions**: The increasing neonatal HSV-related death rate may reflect increases in neonatal herpes incidence; an increasing number of pregnant women have never had HSV type 1 and are therefore at risk of acquiring infection during pregnancy and transmitting to their infant.

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^1141D8pG]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

There are several important limitations to our estimates that are relevant to all regions. Since these estimates of neonatal herpes cases are based on the most recent estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 prevalence and incidence in women aged 15–49 years, the neonatal herpes estimates are affected by the same data availability, generalizability, and quality issues affecting the adult estimates. Individual studies can significantly influence the estimated burden of maternal infection by region, and, consequently, the estimates of neonatal herpes cases. Our estimates of genital HSV-1 are particularly uncertain; we assumed a value for the proportion of incident adult HSV-1 infections that are genital at 50%. To our knowledge, no studies have estimated this proportion outside of the United States. However, Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia appear to have little new HSV-1 infection in adults, so the choice of parameter values for HSV-1 is less influential in these regions.

Although the large, multi-center prospective study in the United States from which our transmission risks were derived followed over 58,000 pregnant women and represents the best available estimates of risk, the number of neonatal herpes cases in this study was extremely small — just 14 cases, which were used to inform our regional and global estimates. Our sensitivity analysis, which incorporated the confidence intervals around the risks from this source study, showed that varying the risks of neonatal transmission due to incident and prevalent cases could affect the estimates significantly.

### Herpes simplex virus-2 variation contributes to neurovirulence during neonatal infection [^113bpurw]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the neonatal brain causes severe encephalitis and permanent neurologic deficits. However, infants infected with HSV at the time of birth follow varied clinical courses, with approximately half of infants experiencing only external infection of the skin rather than invasive neurologic disease. Understanding the cause of these divergent outcomes is essential to developing neuroprotective strategies. To directly assess the contribution of viral variation to neurovirulence, independent of human host factors, we evaluated clinical HSV isolates from neonates with different neurologic outcomes in neurologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models. We found that isolates taken from neonates with encephalitis are more neurovirulent in human neuronal culture and mouse models of HSV encephalitis, as compared to isolates collected from neonates with skin-limited disease. These findings suggest that inherent characteristics of the infecting HSV strain contribute to disease outcome following neonatal infection.

### Induction of apoptosis by herpes simplex virus-1 in neonatal, but not adult, neutrophils [^113GPqkQ]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

We report a study on the effect of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection on the apoptosis of neutrophils from both adults and neonates, presenting evidence showing that HSV-1 enhances apoptosis in neonatal, but not adult, neutrophils. HSV-1 enhanced the expression of both Fas and Fas ligand on the surface of neonatal neutrophils. Treatments with anti-Fas antibody and a Fas ligand inhibitor significantly reduced the induction of apoptosis by HSV-1. Using an ELISA assay, it was found that HSV-1 infection also leads to increased release of soluble FasL from HSV-1-infected neonatal neutrophils. Increased neonatal neutrophil apoptosis following HSV-1 infection may represent an important mechanism by which HSV-1 may diminish the antiviral response of neonatal neutrophils and might explain, at least in part, the severity of infections caused in newborns by this herpesvirus.
