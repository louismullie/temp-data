## Question

How to correct hyponatremia to avoid complciations, rate per day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to correct hyponatremia to avoid complications, specifically the safe daily rate of correction, including how to set correction limits, choose therapies, prevent and manage overcorrection, and account for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about chronicity, symptom severity, and risk factors for osmotic demyelination to stratify risk. Then, I should set evidence-based correction limits for 24 and 48 hours with minimum goals. Next, I'll determine initial stabilization for acute symptomatic cases, define monitoring cadence and targets, and select therapies matched to etiology and volume status. After that, I need to build a proactive plan to prevent overcorrection with desmopressin and outline a rescue protocol if limits are exceeded. Finally, I should consider special populations, document targets for handoffs, and reconcile controversies in the literature before concluding with a concise decision algorithm recap [^113h7J5E] [^116VvNY1] [^114mqwBU].

> Let me first confirm initial risk stratification because everything hinges on it. I need to classify chronicity as acute (< 48 hours) versus chronic (> 48 hours) to estimate the degree of cerebral adaptation via osmolyte loss, which drives susceptibility to osmotic demyelination with rapid correction; I should also grade symptom severity from mild/moderate (nausea, headache, confusion) to severe (seizures, coma, respiratory arrest), since severe symptoms justify an initial rapid but limited rise to mitigate cerebral edema, and I must explicitly identify ODS risk factors such as very low SNa (≤ 105–110), alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, and advanced liver disease, as these mandate more conservative limits and tighter monitoring [^113E6Kdx] [^113h7J5E] [^114mqwBU].

> I need to ensure the correction limits I set align with high-quality guidance. For standard-risk chronic hyponatremia, the accepted upper limits are 10–12 mEq/L in any 24 hours and ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours, with typical minimum daily goals of 4–8 mEq/L; for high-risk patients, limits should be tightened to ≤ 8 mEq/L per 24 hours, with a 4–6 mEq/L minimum, given the disproportionate ODS risk at low nadirs and in the presence of liver disease, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or alcohol use disorder [^113h7J5E] [^114mqwBU] [^116VvNY1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about how to raise sodium in acute symptomatic cases; I initially thought a continuous 3% infusion would be "smoother", but I should verify the data showing that small, repeated 3% hypertonic saline boluses are preferred to rapidly raise SNa by about 4–6 mEq/L within a few hours to reverse life-threatening cerebral edema, then transition to slower, guideline-concordant correction rates thereafter, because boluses achieve targets faster and more predictably than continuous infusions without increasing overshoot risk when monitored closely [^113SHKnQ] [^114zXmxm].

> Next, I should review how to set concrete daily targets and how often to monitor. For example, in a high-risk patient with SNa 115 mEq/L, my 24-hour cap would be 123 mEq/L and the 48-hour cap no more than 133 mEq/L, with recognition that cumulative 48-hour gains matter; to stay safe, I need serum sodium checks every 2–4 hours initially, with careful urine output tracking to catch aquaresis-driven accelerations, and I should keep a safety margin because analytic imprecision means an apparent 8 mEq/L rise might actually be closer to 10 mEq/L in reality [^113SHKnQ] [^115yzmgu].

> I will now examine modality selection tailored to severity and etiology. For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, short boluses of 3% saline to secure a 4–6 mEq/L early rise are preferred, then a transition to slower correction based on volume status and cause; for hypovolemic hyponatremia, isotonic saline is appropriate, whereas in euvolemic SIADH I should favor fluid restriction and consider urea or cautious use of vaptans, recognizing that tolvaptan can precipitate rapid overcorrection and carries boxed warnings necessitating close monitoring and interruption if sodium rises too fast [^114zXmxm] [^114mqwBU] [^112hSp2T].

> Wait, let me verify prevention strategies for inadvertent overcorrection, since aquaresis is the usual culprit. A proactive desmopressin strategy at the outset for high-risk patients to "clamp" urinary water losses, or a reactive strategy when the sodium trajectory accelerates, can reduce target exceedances; the evidence base is observational and limited, but it consistently shows DDAVP lowers correction rates and stabilizes urine output, and pairing DDAVP with hypotonic fluid allows precise titration back into the goal corridor if the curve steepens [^117SmC1L] [^111NtJp7] [^115yzmgu].

> If limits are exceeded, I should double-check that rescue relowering is guideline-endorsed and act immediately. The first step is to stop all sodium-raising therapies, give desmopressin to halt free-water diuresis, and infuse hypotonic fluid such as D5W in calculated amounts to safely re-lower SNa toward the planned trajectory; European guidance explicitly recommends prompt relowering if the increase exceeds 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours or 8 mmol/L on subsequent days, and animal data suggest that timely relowering mitigates blood–brain barrier injury and demyelination, supporting early intervention rather than watchful waiting [^116VvNY1] [^114oqYXZ] [^116XpGZZ].

> But wait, what if special populations alter the risk calculus; I need to ensure I tailor tactics accordingly. In advanced liver disease or peri-transplant settings, sodium-reduced CRRT or dialysate can maintain safe rates during large fluid shifts; in pregnancy with hyperemesis gravidarum, rapid correction has precipitated ODS, so limits should remain conservative despite severity; pediatric data are sparse but case reports document extrapontine myelinolysis after rapid correction, warranting extra caution; in hyperglycemia, I should correct for tonicity and glucose first to avoid misclassifying pseudo-hyponatremia and over-treating [^114GsQsB] [^111Dqcat] [^113dSBeb] [^117MPgeG].

> I should confirm documentation and handoff elements because errors often occur at transitions of care. Explicitly recording the baseline SNa, identified ODS risk factors, agreed 24-hour and 48-hour caps with minimum goals, the monitoring cadence, and proactive or reactive DDAVP plans helps maintain consistency across shifts, and institutional critical value pathways remind teams of the morbidity, mortality, and urgency associated with severe dysnatremias [^1141AeWJ].

> Let me reconsider areas of controversy briefly to ensure balance. A recent meta-analysis suggests associations between very slow correction and higher mortality, but observational confounding is substantial; given the devastating, preventable nature of ODS and the consistent link between rapid correction, low nadir sodium, and demyelination, guideline limits of ≤ 8 mEq/L per 24 hours for high-risk and ≤ 10–12 mEq/L per 24 hours (≤ 18 in 48) for standard-risk patients, with early 4–6 mEq/L rescue in acute symptomatic cases, remain the most defensible course while monitoring closely and adjusting to patient-specific context [^1147wBVW] [^115pq4RC] [^113h7J5E].

> In summary, I need to proceed methodically: confirm chronicity and severity, enumerate ODS risk factors, set conservative caps with minimum daily targets, use 3% saline boluses for acute symptoms, monitor SNa every 2–4 hours with urine output to anticipate aquaresis, employ proactive or reactive desmopressin to stay within the corridor, relower promptly if limits are exceeded, adapt for special populations, and document explicit targets and plans for handoff; this systematic approach minimizes cerebral edema from undertreatment while preventing osmotic demyelination from overcorrection [^113SHKnQ] [^116VvNY1] [^114mqwBU].

To correct hyponatremia safely and avoid complications, **limit sodium correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** for high-risk patients (chronic hyponatremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, advanced liver disease, severe hypokalemia) [^113h7J5E] and **≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours** for low-risk patients [^114mqwBU]. For severe symptoms, administer **100 mL boluses of 3% saline** [^113SHKnQ] to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L [^114zXmxm] rapidly, then slow correction to stay within daily limits [^116JUkNn]. Monitor sodium every **2–4 hours** initially, and use **desmopressin** [^117SmC1L] to prevent or halt overcorrection; if limits are exceeded, relower sodium with D5W [^116VvNY1]. These measures minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination while treating hyponatremia [^115pq4RC].

## Recommended correction rates

Recommended correction rates vary by **patient risk and clinical context**:

| **Patient risk category** | **Recommended correction rate** |
|-|-|
| High-risk patients (chronic hyponatremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, advanced liver disease, severe hypokalemia) | ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours [^113h7J5E] |
| Low-risk patients (acute hyponatremia, no significant risk factors) | ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours [^116JUkNn] |
| Maximum correction limit (all patients) | ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours [^116VvNY1] |

---

## Clinical approach to correction

### Initial assessment

Initial assessment **determines chronicity** (acute < 48 hours vs chronic > 48 hours), evaluates symptom severity (e.g. seizures or coma), and identifies the underlying etiology (e.g. SIADH, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, or medication-induced) [^113Bapty].

---

### Acute symptomatic hyponatremia

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, **immediate correction** consists of 100 mL boluses of 3% hypertonic saline [^113SHKnQ] to raise serum sodium by 4–6 mmol/L [^116JUkNn], repeated as needed until symptoms improve [^114zXmxm]. **Subsequent correction** should be slowed after initial stabilization to remain within the recommended daily limits.

---

### Chronic hyponatremia

In chronic hyponatremia, **slow correction** means gradually correcting within recommended limits [^114mqwBU] to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^115pq4RC], and **monitoring** should include frequent serum sodium measurements (every 2–4 hours initially).

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent monitoring**: Serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable.
- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**: Administer proactively or reactively to prevent or halt overcorrection [^117SmC1L].
- **Relowering sodium**: If overcorrection occurs, administer hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W) and/or desmopressin to safely reduce serum sodium [^116VvNY1] [^115yzmgu].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)**: Rapid correction (> 8 mmol/L/day) significantly increases the risk of ODS, a potentially irreversible neurologic complication [^113h7J5E].
- **Mortality**: Rapid correction is associated with increased mortality, particularly in high-risk patients.
- **Neurologic sequelae**: Rapid correction can cause seizures, dysarthria, dysphagia, and permanent neurologic deficits [^112hSp2T].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **High-risk patients**: ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours.
- **Low-risk patients**: ≤ 10–12 mmol/L in 24 hours.
- **Maximum correction**: ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.
- **Immediate correction**: 100 mL 3% saline boluses for severe symptoms [^113SHKnQ].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent serum sodium measurements.
- **Desmopressin**: Use to prevent or halt overcorrection [^117SmC1L].
- **Relowering**: Use hypotonic fluids if overcorrection occurs [^116VvNY1].

Correcting hyponatremia requires **careful adherence to recommended correction rates**, frequent monitoring, and judicious use of desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome [^114bTxzD].

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: A retrospective cohort analysis [^1169HNqy]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of < 135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder characterized by a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports classify SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as "profound" hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been discussed intensively worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma.

- **Overcorrection and its complications**: In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia difficult because it can provoke osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia.

- **Strategies for correction**: To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies, including administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W), have been introduced. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in chronic profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, including SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (referred to as the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance.

For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L (such as outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or those treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period, with a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L.

The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, with a minimum daily correction goal of 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary but unlikely to cause harm.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, specifically in patients with severe symptoms, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend limiting sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia who are at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. In patients without such risk factors, sodium correction should be limited to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: A systematic review [^117SmC1L]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature search of four databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed, and study quality was appraised.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found three strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia:
	1. Proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration.
	2. Reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output.
	3. Rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent.

	- A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with a lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

- **Conclusions**: Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions.

### Extrapontine myelinolysis in a pediatric case of diabetic ketoacidosis and cerebral edema [^112kQV4P]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis are characterized by symmetric demyelination following rapid shifts in serum osmolality. However, in extrapontine myelinolysis, demyelination is confined to the supratentorial compartment. We present a case of extrapontine myelinolysis in a 17-year-old female that occurred in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, cerebral edema, mannitol therapy, and meningitis. The rate of correction of this patient's glucose and electrolyte levels was within well-accepted limits.

Extrapontine myelinolysis is rare in pediatric patients. There are only 12 reports of extrapontine myelinolysis in children under age 20 years, and no pediatric cases of extrapontine myelinolysis or central pontine myelinolysis associated with diabetic ketoacidosis have been documented.

We review the published cases of extrapontine myelinolysis and examine the underlying etiologies and electrolyte disturbances that characterize these cases. This case expands the list of conditions in which extrapontine myelinolysis occurs to include pediatric patients with complicated diabetic ketoacidosis, emphasizing the importance of sudden osmolar shifts in the genesis of this disorder.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate, and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to classification, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend classifying hypernatremia according to the serum sodium level:

- **Situation**: Guidance

	- **Moderate**: 150–159 mmol/L
	- **Severe**: > 160 mmol/L

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^113pumUb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance, including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication, and the complications of excessive therapy, such as the osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Recent findings indicate that correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/l within 6 hours, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial.

Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls due to impaired gait and an increased likelihood of fracture due to hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^115vvueJ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Six days after the development of hypernatremia, several other symptoms became evident, including dysarthria, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis. Due to these symptoms, we suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) associated with acute hypernatremia. A brain MRI confirmed our clinical suspicion, revealing a symmetric high-intensity signal in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, which suggested central pontine myelinolysis (CPM).

Soon after this diagnostic confirmation of CPM, we initiated two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions over two days. A total of 4394 mL of plasma was exchanged with albumin 5%, crystalloids, and fresh frozen plasma. The day following the plasma exchange, the patient regained speech and became oriented. Her neurological symptoms, including dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis, markedly improved, although mild diplopia persisted.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: A simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^111nqQot]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but the correction must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium levels not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

- **Study design**: Quality improvement report.

- **Setting & participants**: All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level increases of more than 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or more than 18 mEq/L in 48 hours without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of outcomes.

### Central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with anorexia nervosa [^111tbnfU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Myelinolysis may occur as a severe complication of eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa (AN). One of the most important reasons can be a rapid correction of hyponatremia caused by tubulopathy, water intoxication (WI), or abuse of diuretics in individuals with AN.

- **Method and results**: We report on a 24-year-old female patient with an 8-year history of AN. A rapid correction of severe hyponatremia and hypokalemia induced by WI led to central pontine myelinolysis, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Besides affective lability, incoherence, and an acute confusional state, surprisingly, no severe neurological symptoms emerged.

- **Conclusion**: Thus, physicians should be aware of the risk of pontine myelinolysis with new psychiatric symptoms emerging in the absence of obvious neurological deficits.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^114XjLFG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Support for the idea that osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely rare was provided by uncritical acceptance of the results of a recent, large retrospective study; the investigators concluded that myelinolysis affects only 0.05% of patients with hyponatremia and is unrelated to rapid correction (defined as an increase of > 8 mmol/L per day). However, nearly 90% of the patients studied had a sodium > 120 mmol/L, and others may have had acute hyponatremia due to self-induced water intoxication or exacerbation of hyponatremia by hyperglycemia. Although the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome in such patients is known to be vanishingly low, the study weighed the benefits of a therapeutic limit that was intended for patients whose risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome was unusually high.

Adherence to an 8-mmol/L daily correction limit in patients with a serum sodium > 120 mmol/L would reflect an abundance of caution; but, predictably, if that limit was marginally exceeded, very few patients would be harmed. Notwithstanding, myelinolysis was documented in 2.6% of patients in a subset of the study's population with a sodium < 110 mmol/L, a population that has been shown to be at higher risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome when rapidly corrected. But even that figure likely underestimates the true prevalence of osmotic demyelination syndrome among such patients because of the method used to identify patients with the disorder. To identify patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome, this study relied on diagnostic coding of medical records.

### Evaluation of serum and whole blood sodium critical values [^1141AeWJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Laboratories are required to have a critical values policy as a patient safety measure. Serum sodium is commonly included in critical results lists, but a wide range of values are used. We studied all critical serum and whole blood sodium results that were called to clinicians during a 6-month period. Patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical responses and patient outcomes. Of the 111,545 sodium results occurring during the study, 615 (0.6%) were critical. By using criteria of 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L) or less and 155 mEq/L (155 mmol/L) or more, we found 166 critically low results and 447 critically high results. In hypernatremic and hyponatremic patients, the lengths of stay were increased above our average, and clinicians responded to more than 50% of results within 4 hours. The mortality rates of hyponatremic and hypernatremic inpatients were 19% and 48%, respectively. Disease severity, as measured by length of stay and mortality, indicated these critical limits should not be broadened.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^113E6Kdx]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a critically important consideration in hyponatremia of chronic or unknown duration. Managing the risk of ODS involves avoiding excessively rapid correction of serum sodium concentration, which can damage the protective neural myelin sheath as a consequence of osmotic stress, with severe, potentially fatal, consequences. ODS was first reported in 1959 in a series of individuals presenting with rapidly evolving flaccid quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, and then death within weeks. These individuals were found to have distinctive pontine lesions at autopsy, on a background of alcohol abuse and malnutrition. It was only in the 1980s, after preclinical studies in animals demonstrated demyelination after rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia, that causation was established, supported by concordant patient observations.

When hyponatremia is chronic, brain cells adapt to the reduced serum tonicity by decreasing intracellular osmolytes (e.g. electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and nonelectrolyte organic osmolytes). This adaptation lowers the tonicity gradient between brain tissue and serum, reducing water influx and lessening the risk of cerebral edema. This adaptation to hyponatremia occurs in two phases. The initial phase involves the rapid exit of electrolytes through volume-sensing channels, occurring over minutes to hours, to avert life-threatening sequelae of cerebral edema such as seizures or brain herniation (though a degree of edema may still occur and can still have severe clinical consequences). The second phase of adaptation occurs over hours to days.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113h7J5E]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Our treatment of hyponatremia should be informed by the best possible data, addressing two critical questions: How much correction is enough and how much is too much? Valid answers to these questions require studies of populations at high risk of complications from both excessive and inadequate correction of hyponatremia — patients with very low serum sodium. A study of individuals diagnosed with MRI-documented myelinolysis in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997–2011 identified 83 patients with the disorder; 86.7% of patients were hyponatremic (all chronic), with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L, and all but six had been corrected by > 8 mmol/L in 24 hours. To be reliable, such studies will require rigorous methods to quantify increases in serum sodium throughout the hospital course and to accurately identify all complications — not just the most severe. In the future, those methods might include sophisticated software. But for now, meticulous chart review by hand, the method used when "osmotic demyelination syndrome" was given its name 37 years ago, remains the best approach.

Thankfully, changes in practice patterns have made osmotic demyelination syndrome less common than it was in the 1980s. On the basis of what we know today, correction of a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L by > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours or by > 18 mmol/L within 48 hours should be avoided — not because raising the serum sodium too rapidly commonly causes osmotic demyelination syndrome but because it can cause the syndrome. It has always been clear that overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does

### Early MRI findings of central pontine myelinolysis following "rapid" correction of hyponatraemia during diabetic ketoacidosis. A curious pontine lesion [^117Pigw7]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a diabetic patient with hyponatraemia and ketoacidosis who developed central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) following a very rapid correction of serum sodium. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the marked shifts in osmolarity make these patients more susceptible to the development of CPM. The dramatic early MRI findings (after three weeks) should raise awareness of the risk of permanent damage to the brain associated with hydration therapy in this susceptible group. Magnetic resonance imaging might be a useful investigation at presentation and follow-up of diabetic patients with extreme metabolic derangements.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: Major influences and treatment implications [^117MPgeG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Maintenance of the volume of all cells, particularly those of the central nervous system, is critical for their function and survival. Tonicity (i.e. effective osmolarity) of a solution refers to its property to cause osmotic fluid shifts into or out of cells suspended in it. Direct determination of serum tonicity is not readily available for clinical applications. Serum sodium concentration ([Na] S) is the main parameter used as a surrogate value for serum tonicity. The only direct information provided by [Na] S is whether serum tonicity is normal (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with normal [Na] S is not affected), low (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with low [Na] S increases by osmotic intracellular transfer of water), or high (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with high [Na] S decreases by osmotic transfer of water out of the cells).

In a pivotal study, Edelman and coinvestigators identified total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water as the universal determinants of [Na] S in patients with various states potentially associated with extracellular volume disturbances. Abnormalities in [Na] S usually result from changes in the external balance of one of its three determinants or a combination thereof. The relations between [Na] S and total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water have been expressed by various formulas. The original Edelman formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma water. The Nguyen and Kurtz formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma, which is…

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

- **What was known**: In patients with chronic hyponatremia, plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination. Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

- **This study adds**: Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium, and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea. Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

- **Potential impact**: In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^113zZEET]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Our case indicates that serum sodium concentrations should be carefully monitored in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) who are receiving intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy. It is important to consider that acute hypernatremia and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) can be associated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy. CPM due to acute hypernatremia may be effectively treated with plasma exchange.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^114zXmxm]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients.

With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Outcomes in severe hyponatremia treated with and without desmopressin [^115FKVaN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of plasma sodium in severe hyponatremia is associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can prevent overcorrection of plasma sodium in hyponatremia. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes in hyponatremia according to DDAVP usage.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study including all admissions to internal medicine with hyponatremia (plasma sodium concentration < 123 mEq/L) from 2004 to 2014 at two academic hospitals in Toronto, Canada. The primary outcome was safe sodium correction (≤ 12 mEq/L in any 24-hour and ≤ 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period).

- **Results**: We identified 1,450 admissions with severe hyponatremia; DDAVP was administered in 254 (17.5%). Although DDAVP reduced the rate of change of plasma sodium, fewer patients in the DDAVP group achieved safe correction (174 of 251 [69.3%] vs. 970 of 1,164 [83.3%]); this result was driven largely by overcorrection occurring before DDAVP administration in the rescue group. Among patients receiving DDAVP, most received it according to a reactive strategy, whereby DDAVP was given following a change in plasma sodium within correction limits (174 of 254 [68.5%]). Suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome was identified in 4 of 1,450 admissions (0.28%). There was lower mortality in the DDAVP group (3.9% vs. 9.4%), although this is likely affected by confounding. Length of stay in the hospital was longer in those who received DDAVP according to a proactive strategy.

- **Conclusions**: Although observational, these data support a reactive strategy for using DDAVP in patients at risk.

### Decreased diffusion in central pontine myelinolysis [^1118cYUb]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Two patients with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) were studied using diffusion-weighted MR imaging one week after the onset of tetraplegia. In both patients, affected white matter showed hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images, associated with a decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. In one patient studied serially, ADC values normalized by three weeks after tetraplegia. Early in the clinical course, diagnosing CPM can sometimes be difficult. Hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images may therefore have diagnostic utility. Decreased lesional ADC values support the notion that CPM results from relative intracellular hypotonicity.

### Extrapontine myelinolysis resulting in transient cortical blindness [^115dWAwD]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are characterized by symmetric demyelination subsequent to rapid shifts in serum osmolality. This text describes a novel case of transient cortical blindness associated with imaging features of extrapontine myelinolysis. It occurred in a child with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency following the rapid correction of hyperammonemia. Serum sodium levels remained within normal limits at presentation and throughout the period of ammonia correction.

A potential pathogenic mechanism of osmotic demyelination in the setting of acute treatment for hyperammonemia in a patient with a urea cycle abnormality includes the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the re-equilibration of organic osmolytes, particularly glutamine.

### Urea minimizes brain complications following rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia compared with vasopressin antagonist or hypertonic saline [^114Tiy9y]. Kidney International (2015). High credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that carries significant morbidity and mortality. However, it is critical not to correct severe chronic hyponatremia rapidly to avoid brain demyelination. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) are now widely used for treating hyponatremia, along with alternatives like hypertonic saline. Previous reports have suggested that urea can also be used to correct hyponatremia in certain cases. To date, no comparison has been made between correction of severe hyponatremia with urea and treatment with a vaptan or hypertonic saline regarding the risk of brain complications when serum sodium rises too rapidly.

In this study, we compared the neurological outcomes of hyponatremic rats corrected rapidly with urea, lixivaptan, and hypertonic saline. Despite similar increases in serum sodium achieved by the three interventions, treatment with lixivaptan or hypertonic saline resulted in higher mortality than treatment with urea. Histological analysis demonstrated that treatment with urea resulted in less pathological change of experimental osmotic demyelination compared to hypertonic saline or lixivaptan. These pathological changes included breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, microglial activation, astrocyte demise, and demyelination. Thus, overcorrection of hyponatremia with urea resulted in significantly lower mortality and neurological impairment than overcorrection with lixivaptan or hypertonic saline.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

- **Administration of desmopressin**: Desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) has been used either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. The approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction.

- **Risks and recommendations**: The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder. These include individuals with a sodium level of ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours.

- **Special considerations for some patients**: On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal. Because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is lower, the approach to their treatment may differ.

### Sodium-reduced continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) for the prevention of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) in hyponatremic patients scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation [^114GsQsB]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Two patients in end-stage hepatic failure presented for orthotopic liver transplantation with longstanding severe hyponatremia (121 and 122 mmol/L). Both patients underwent liver transplantation with the concomitant use of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Replacement and dialysate solutions were prepared individually to contain a sodium level that was individually considered safe with regard to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. The sodium increase in both patients was within the expected and planned limits despite a situation of mass transfusion. Both patients did well postoperatively and neither patient suffered neurological deficits.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^113qpP9E]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The present study identified that an initial low level of serum sodium (SNa) was associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with profound hyponatremia. The rapid increase in SNa during the first 4 hours may play an important role in overcorrection. It is also important to note that no osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) occurred in the present study, and that minimizing SNa increases is important to prevent ODS, even when overcorrection does occur.

### Disorders of sodium [^113Bapty]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Sodium imbalances are common in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, identifying the cause and determining management should be approached systematically. It is vital to ascertain if the patient has symptoms and how long the imbalance has been present. The speed of treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms, with the most rapid treatment reserved for severely symptomatic patients. Overcorrection can have dire consequences and must be managed carefully and systematically to prevent these devastating outcomes.

### A rare presentation of central pontine myelinolysis secondary to hyperglycaemia [^1132bsrK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a demyelinating disorder caused by the loss of myelin in the center of the basis pontis. This disorder presents clinically with quadriparesis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, psychosis, seizures, and altered mental status. CPM was initially described in patients with malnutrition or alcoholism and typically occurred after rapid correction of severe and chronic hyponatremia. Other pathogenetic conditions, including prolonged diuretic use, burns, and liver transplantation, have also been recognized as risk factors for the development of CPM.

While hyperglycaemia is a potential cause of disturbances in serum osmolality, CPM rarely occurs secondary to the management of diabetes mellitus, especially in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Although there is no effective treatment for CPM, recent results suggest that early diagnosis and improved intensive care treatment are closely associated with improved outcomes. In the present case report, the patient developed CPM following uncontrolled hyperglycaemia in the absence of sodium abnormalities; he responded well to glucose control, recovering completely.

### Extrapontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia presenting as generalized tonic seizures [^113G6AwG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are rare complications of the rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. Central pontine myelinolysis is more common and more predictable in presentation. The presenting symptoms of extrapontine myelinolysis vary and may be as general as lethargy or altered mood. We report an experience with a patient who developed only extrapontine myelinolysis after the rapid correction of severe hyponatremia associated with gastroenteritis. His presenting sign, generalized seizures, has not been previously reported. We summarize risk factors for myelinolysis, which may be more common than previously thought, as well as steps to minimize risk while managing vulnerable patients.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1163shSW]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Incidence of overcorrection and ODS**: The incidence of overcorrection varies depending on its definition and mode of correction. A retrospective study that involved 412 patients with serum sodium (SNa) of 10 mEq/L during the first 24 hours reported that 114 (27.9%) patients were overcorrected. However, the study did not discuss the treatment strategies for hyponatremia in detail. Another retrospective study, which included 62 patients, concluded that 7 (11.3%) patients exceeded the increase of SNa by > 12 mEq/L and 6 (9.7%) patients by > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively. The treatment included administration of 3% hypertonic saline, D5W, and DDAVP, which were used in patients in whom overcorrection was likely or had occurred. The incidence of overcorrection in our study was consistent with that observed in these previous studies. We identified that 9 (16.0%) patients had an increase in SNa by > 10 mEq/L and 6 (10.7%) by > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively.

The international guidelines define overcorrection with a safety margin. We speculated that no ODS occurred mainly because the increase in SNa was relatively limited in the present study. Even in patients with overcorrection, SNa increased by 12 mEq/L (quartile, 11–15 mEq/L) and 19 mEq/L (quartile, 17–23 mEq/L) during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Similarly, in a previous retrospective study in which four of 37 patients (11%) with overcorrection developed ODS, the increases in SNa were 21 ± 5 mEq/L and 28 ± 8 mEq/L.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^116L6Pcv]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) or extra-pontine myelinolysis, primarily occurs after the rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. The clinical manifestations of ODS are typically delayed for two to six days after swift elevations in the serum sodium level. The symptoms, which are often irreversible or only partially reversible, include dysarthria, dysphagia, tetraparesis, behavioral disturbances, lethargy, confusion, disorientation, and coma. ODS can also occur during other osmotic challenges, such as the rapid correction of hypernatremia and the development of acute hypernatremia from normal sodium concentrations.

When CPM is associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia, plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can be a beneficial therapy. In fact, Bibl et al. reported that three young female patients with CPM, associated with the correction of hyponatremia, were successfully treated with extensive therapeutic plasma exchange. However, this is the first case report of CPM after the rapid development of hypernatremia from sodium bicarbonate therapy successfully treated by plasma exchange.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: A retrospective cohort analysis [^1141pEhM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Among the 56 patients, 6 (11%) from the "no-overcorrection" group died during hospitalization due to infectious diseases (n = 4) or cancer (n = 2). Both of these conditions may have caused hyponatremia in these patients. Among the 50 patients who were discharged alive, 12 were lost to follow-up; this was partly because they were referred to their family doctors or cancelled their outpatient visits unexpectedly. Among the 38 patients who were ultimately followed up at our institution, there were no rehospitalizations due to hyponatremia within a median follow-up of 822 days (quartile, 199–1411).

### Benign type of central pontine myelinolysis in alcoholism — clinical, neuroradiological and electrophysiological findings [^117EhecA]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Nine alcoholic patients with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), who showed a favorable prognosis, are reported. The majority of them had engaged in binge drinking and subsequently experienced consciousness disturbances for an average of 18.1 days (SD = 10.9). None of the patients had undergone acute correction of hyponatremia.

Truncal ataxia and gait instability were present in most patients following recovery from consciousness disturbance. Most eventually regained independence. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that their pontine lesions tended to shrink.

Electrophysiological studies detected prolonged latency between the I and III waves in auditory brainstem responses and between N11 and P13/14 onsets in the somatosensory evoked potentials. These clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings are useful for diagnosing CPM.

### Sodium homeostasis during liver transplantation and correlation with outcomes [^113des5C]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Reports of perioperative serum sodium increase in liver transplant (LT) recipients are mostly restricted to unintentional rapid serum sodium overcorrection with subsequent development of central pontine myelinolysis. We examined intraoperative serum sodium changes and their effect on short-term outcomes after LT.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed data of all LT recipients over a period of 3.5 years. Collected information included preoperative and postoperative serum sodium (Napre and Napost), delta sodium (ΔNa), intraoperative serum sodium peak and trough with corresponding maximum ΔNa, intraoperative peak blood glucose, history of hepatic encephalopathy, perioperative diuretics, intraoperative administration of vasopressin, dopaminergic agents, alkalizing drugs (sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3], tromethamine), crystalloids, colloids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and packed red blood cells (PRBC). The delta of serum osmolality (ΔOsm) was calculated from Napre and Napost, blood urea nitrogen, and blood glucose values, and the correlation between ΔNa and ΔOsm was examined. Outcomes analyzed included intubation for ≥ 2 days, postanesthesia care unit/surgical intensive care unit (PACU/SICU) length of stay (LOS) for ≥ 2 days, need of SICU admission, hospital LOS, postoperative neurological complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test associations between ΔNa and outcomes. A P value < 0.005 was considered significant.

- **Results**: Data of 164 patients were analyzed. Their ΔNa was 5.3 ± 4.5 (mean ± SD) mEq/L. A lower Napre was associ

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^114Ny94U]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In terms of her hypokalemia work-up, clinical history and the absence of diarrhea excluded gastrointestinal losses of potassium. Refractoriness to potassium supplementation suggested renal loss. Renal potassium wasting was confirmed by measuring 24-hour potassium excretion (125 mmol/24 hours), calculating a urine anion gap of +29, a potassium-to-creatinine ratio of 100 mmol/g, and a transtubular potassium gradient of 16. All these were in the setting of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and preserved renal function, leading to the diagnosis of proximal RTA.

Collection of 24-hour urine potassium is often impractical; our first result was borderline elevated at 125 mmol/24 hours. In the presence of profound hypokalemia, the normal renal response would be to conserve potassium and decrease excretion to less than 25 mEq per day. Excretion of over 30 mEq per day is consistent with renal potassium wasting. A spot urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio is an acceptable estimate, and a result greater than 13 mEq/g creatinine (1.5 mEq/mmol) points to inappropriate renal potassium loss. The spot urine potassium by itself has limitations in polyuria and can sometimes be misleading.

For an accurate estimate, the urine sodium has to be greater than 30 mEq/L and urine osmolality greater than plasma osmolality, suggesting that the patient is not polyuric. Hence, the use of the potassium-to-creatinine ratio helps to eliminate the effect of urine volume. A study by Lin et al. in 2004 showed that the urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio was a reliable tool to distinguish between hypokalemic periodic paralysis and other causes.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^117936YZ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and a weight loss of 8 kg over the previous two months. The patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 57 kg. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, and her pulse was 110 beats/minute. She was not on diuretics or other medications, and there was no medical history or diarrhea upon presentation.

On admission, she showed weakness in both limbs, assessed as Medical Research Council Grade 2, but her deep-tendon reflexes were intact. Additionally, Babinski's sign and ankle clonus were absent.

Initial laboratory analysis showed sodium at 142.8 mEq/L, potassium at 2.3 mEq/L, chloride at 125.5 mEq/L, calcium at 7.7 mg/dL, phosphorus at 1.1 mg/dL, magnesium at 2.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen at 17.7 mg/dL, creatinine at 1.0 mg/dL, and albumin at 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, indicating renal loss.

Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO2 of 67.8 mmHg, HCO3 of 7.6 mEq/L, SpO2 of 90.2%, and a serum anion gap of 9.7, pointing to normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis showed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^112qoopD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a condition characterized by severe vomiting resulting in dehydration, fluid electrolyte imbalance, and weight loss. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman who was hospitalized at week 10 of gestation due to severe hyperemesis. The condition appeared at week 4 of pregnancy and caused her weight to drop from 51 kg to 46 kg. On the day of admission to the hospital, she became restless and confused.

Clinical examination performed in the emergency room revealed mild dehydration, indicated by a dry mouth and skin, with normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, and slightly reduced breath frequency. Biochemical assessment at admission showed severe hyponatraemia (107 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (1.1 mmol/L) with secondary metabolic alkalosis and partially compensated respiratory acidosis. Urinary data suggested extra-renal loss of Na+ and K+ with an appropriate increase in urinary water and electrolyte retention.

The patient was promptly admitted to the intensive care unit, and intravenous isotonic NaCl solution along with K-lactate supplementation was started. The electrolyte disorder was intensively monitored with blood sample evaluation performed every two hours. However, during the first six hours after admission, an excessive rate of correction of serum Na+ concentration ([Na+]) occurred (Δ 10 mmol/L). Hence, isotonic solution was replaced with hypotonic solution (5% dextrose), while K-lactate supplementation was maintained.

### Osmotic demyelination syndrome in type 1 diabetes in the absence of dyselectrolytaemia: An overlooked complication [^113aBvSR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that involves the central portion of the pons and sometimes extrapontine areas as well. It is commonly reported in settings of hyponatraemia or its rapid correction, but in the last few years, it has also been reported in patients with diabetes in the absence of electrolyte disturbances or correction of serum osmolality. Here we report a case of a 20-year-old female patient with a known history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, who presented with acute onset spastic quadriparesis with dysarthria and mild ataxia, which evolved over two weeks. Her MRI brain scan showed a well-defined, bilateral symmetric hyperintense lesion involving the central pons, showing an area of diffusion restriction consistent with CPM. The patient was treated conservatively and improved over a period of a few weeks. To diagnose more cases, we should not overlook CPM in patients with diabetes.

### Extrapontine myelinolysis in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^113dSBeb]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Extrapontine myelinolysis is rare in children. We describe a 6-year-old girl with nephrotic syndrome who presented with symptomatic hyponatremia and developed acute quadriparesis with pseudobulbar palsy during the rapid correction of the hyponatremia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral, symmetric basal ganglia lesions (extrapontine myelinolysis). The extrapontine myelinolysis was caused by the rapid correction of severe and prolonged hyponatremia with intravenous 3% sodium chloride. The child demonstrated complete neurologic recovery. Prevention of this rare condition involves recognizing patients at risk for the disorder and avoiding rapid correction of severe and prolonged hyponatremia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of extrapontine myelinolysis in a child with nephrotic syndrome.

### Samsca [^112hSp2T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Too rapid correction of serum sodium can cause serious neurologic sequelae**: Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g. > 12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination can result in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma, or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism, or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable.

In controlled clinical trials where tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours, and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours, and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with Samsca therapy. Patients treated with Samsca should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving Samsca who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with Samsca and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours is recommended.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116425hH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. Based on the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned.

These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm.

The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema. Excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death due to osmotic demyelination.

The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose significant challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations, which defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments. These include new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients.

As a result, additional guidance was deemed necessary. A panel of hyponatremia experts, including all of the original panel members, was convened to update the previous recommendations for the optimal management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent suggested approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent evidence.

### Psychogenic polydipsia, hyponatremia and osmotic myelinolysis [^111xvkN9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

This paper describes a case of osmotic myelinolysis associated with hyponatremia as a consequence of compulsive water drinking.

- **Method**: The study is based on a case report and a review of relevant literature.

- **Results**: Compulsive water drinking, or psychogenic polydipsia, is identified as a common cause of hyponatremia among individuals with chronic mental illness. Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis are serious neurological complications resulting from the rapid correction of serum sodium and associated changes in serum osmolality. A case of extrapontine myelinolysis, confirmed by characteristic MRI findings following an episode of extreme hyponatremia caused by psychogenic polydipsia, is described. It involves a patient with a lifelong history of chronic mental illness diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder. With supportive care, the related cognitive deficits and balance difficulties resolved completely.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for hyponatremia resulting from compulsive water drinking to cause myelinolysis with delayed development of cognitive and gait symptoms. These symptoms respond to supportive care if identified early.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. The risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^116DrkQu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Our patient had also been started on steroids as treatment for a possible MS flare. Steroids, especially dexamethasone, have been reported to improve the outcome of hypernatremic demyelination in rats by offering protection against osmotic-induced demyelination through preventing disruption of the blood–brain barrier. It is yet unclear whether this played a role in the reversibility of symptoms and better prognosis in our patient. A follow-up MRI is needed to evaluate the resolution of the CPM lesion.

- **Learning points**: The clinical manifestations of acute hypernatremia, including altered mental status and paresis, are similar to those of rapidly corrected hyponatremia. It is important to avoid overzealous fluid resuscitation. For example, in this case, it would have been prudent to change to 5% dextrose when serum sodium was 148 mEq/L. The osmotic stress, rather than the absolute value of sodium, whether high or low, seems to correlate more with the severity of symptoms. The presence of other electrolyte derangements, such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, certainly increases the risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) lesions seem to be more common in hyponatremia, while extrapontine lesions are more common in hypernatremia, as reported by Ismail et al. They also mentioned that hypernatremic brain osmotic injury is far more common in children than in adults. Our case presents a rare occurrence of CPM in a woman who developed CPM due to acute hypernatremia and who fortunately had a good outcome.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

- **Study selection**: Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs. slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Pairs of reviewers independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11,811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series based on patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are compiled. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L**: When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L — according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium level of ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with such low sodium levels who had been recently treated.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^115YQeus]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, particularly in patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve) and limiting it to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in symptomatic patients with hypernatremia that developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia).

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. Based on the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago.

After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^112qTXNC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The study's conclusion indicates that osmotic demyelination syndrome is unrelated to the correction of hyponatremia. This was based on the finding that most patients with myelinolysis had been corrected by 8 mmol/L per day, while 1.5% of the 390 corrected by > 12 mmol/L per day developed osmotic demyelination syndrome. It was possible that some cases with osmotic demyelination syndrome had been missed. The authors of the other study speculated that a possible reason for this discrepancy is underreporting or misdiagnosis.

### Ddavp [^117422wt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Hyponatremia**: DDAVP can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Contraindications**: DDAVP is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, illnesses causing fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Monitoring**: Ensure the serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium is necessary for patients 65 years of age and older and those at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Action if hyponatremia occurs**: If hyponatremia occurs, DDAVP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Full prescribing information**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

- **Summary of risks**: DDAVP can cause hyponatremia, which may be life-threatening if severe [see section 5.1]. It is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, including those with excessive fluid intake, illnesses affecting fluid or electrolyte balance, and those on loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see sections 4, 5.1]. Ensure serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP, and monitor it regularly.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^116XpGZZ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Because there are no proven effective therapies for CPM, its prevention is essential. Supportive therapy should be provided to all patients who were functional prior to the onset of CPM and should be continued for at least six to eight weeks before drawing conclusions about the severity of the deficits and their irreversibility.

There have been some animal studies investigating the benefits of re-inducing hyponatremia in the case of rapid overcorrection of hyponatremia to avoid osmotic demyelination. Gankam Kengne et al. demonstrated that re-induction of hyponatremia by intraperitoneal administration of water 12 hours after rapid overcorrection of hyponatremia effectively prevented the opening of the BBB, reduced neurological manifestations, decreased microglial activation, and resulted in a significant decrease in mortality in rats. The rat experiment by Soupart et al. showed that after exposure to an excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia, even when rats had developed myelinolysis-related neurologic symptoms, administration of hypotonic fluids could improve survival and prevent the subsequent development of brain myelinolysis.

Although there are no well-studied therapies for CPM, plasma exchange might be a beneficial therapy when CPM is associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. For example, according to Bibl et al, three young female patients with CPM were successfully treated with extensive therapeutic plasma exchange. These patients were treated with plasma exchange for three to seven weeks, and their neurological symptoms were improved.

### Minocycline prevents osmotic demyelination associated with aquaresis [^113zy8Hs]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Minocycline protects against ODS associated with overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline infusion in rats. In clinical practice, inadvertent rapid correction frequently occurs due to water diuresis when vasopressin action suddenly ceases. In addition, vasopressin receptor antagonists have been applied to treat hyponatremia.

Susceptibility to and pathology of ODS were evaluated using rat models developed to represent rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia in the clinical setting. The protective effect of minocycline against ODS was assessed. Chronic hyponatremia was rapidly corrected by 1 mg/kg (T1) or 10 mg/kg (T10) of tolvaptan, removal of desmopressin infusion pumps (RP), or administration of hypertonic saline. The severity of neurological impairment in the T1 group was significantly milder than in other groups, and brain hemorrhage was found only in the T10 and desmopressin infusion removal groups. Minocycline inhibited demyelination in the T1 group.

Further, immunohistochemistry showed loss of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes before demyelination developed. Interestingly, serum AQP4 levels were associated with neurological impairments. Thus, minocycline can prevent ODS caused by overly rapid correction of hyponatremia due to water diuresis associated with vasopressin action suppression. Increased serum AQP4 levels may be a predictive marker for ODS.

### Minocycline protects against neurologic complications of rapid correction of hyponatremia [^1118wJBj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a devastating neurologic condition that occurs after rapid correction of serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia. Pathologic features of this injury include a well-demarcated region of myelin loss, a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and infiltration of microglia. The semisynthetic tetracycline minocycline is protective in some animal models of central nervous system injury, including demyelination, suggesting that it may also protect against demyelination resulting from rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using a rat model of osmotic demyelination syndrome, we found that treatment with minocycline significantly decreases brain demyelination, alleviates neurologic manifestations, and reduces mortality associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. Mechanistically, minocycline decreased the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, inhibited microglial activation, decreased both the expression of IL1α and protein nitrosylation, and reduced the loss of GFAP immunoreactivity.

In conclusion, minocycline modifies the course of osmotic demyelination in rats, suggesting its possible therapeutic use in the setting of inadvertent rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia in humans.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, specifically concerning the management of overly rapid correction, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend prompt intervention to re-lower the serum sodium concentration if it increases by more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours or by more than 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period thereafter.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: Expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. Moreover, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can result in severe neurologic deficits and death. Optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established.

An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including the identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1121b7dy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

As ODS can be a devastating outcome, overcorrection should be scrupulously avoided to reduce risk. For this reason, recommended sodium correction targets often err on the conservative side for safety, particularly in those with risk factors for ODS for whom a daily correction limit of 6 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours is endorsed by US expert opinion guidelines. It is the net 24-hour change in pNa rather than the precise hourly rate of correction that is most important.

The management of patients who develop ODS is outside the scope of this review, but in brief, there are no established therapies. To maintain correction within the goal range, relowering of serum sodium with hypotonic fluid and/or desmopressin may be required if pNa targets are surpassed, and can still be beneficial even for those who have developed early symptoms of ODS (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium").

Case reports describe good outcomes after treatment of ODS with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and zolpidem; however, it is unclear if improvements occurred as the result of these interventions. Glucocorticoids have been assessed in animal models of ODS and have shown reduced histological damage, but there are conflicting data with respect to mortality benefit. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid therapy after overcorrection is recommended in US expert guidelines for those with baseline pNa less than 120 mmol/L.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^111Dqcat]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) may be observed as a result of a rapid change in serum osmolarity, such as that induced by an overly rapid correction of serum sodium levels in hyponatraemic patients.

- **Case presentation**: We describe the case of a 21-year-old woman who was hospitalized at week 10 of gestation because of severe hyperemesis. At admission, the patient appeared restless and confused, and severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium 107 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (serum potassium 1.1 mmol/L) were detected. Active and simultaneous correction of these imbalances led to an overly rapid increase of serum sodium levels (17 mmol/L in the first 24 hours). Isotonic saline solution was stopped and replaced by a 5% dextrose solution infusion. However, the neurological alterations worsened and the radiological features were consistent with a diagnosis of extra-pontine ODS. Steroids were administered intravenously with progressive improvement of biochemical and clinical abnormalities. At the time of discharge, 20 days later, the patient was able to walk and eat autonomously with only minimal external support.

- **Conclusions**: This report illustrates an unusual case of ODS that occurred after an excessive rate of correction of hyponatraemia obtained with isotonic saline infusion. Hypokalemia and its active correction very likely played a crucial role in facilitating the onset of ODS. This interesting aspect will be explained in detail in the article. A more cautious and thoughtful correction of electrolyte alterations would have probably prevented the onset of ODS in this patient.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^116cMhje]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a rare neuropathology typically associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia. The pons is especially sensitive to osmotic changes, and neurological symptoms can occur within 2–3 days. Symptoms can progress within days to include paralysis, 'locked-in syndrome', and even coma and death. Thus, it is of utmost importance to prevent significant morbidity and mortality in patients predisposed to this condition, especially when disability can be permanent.

Interestingly, there has been some controversy regarding other causes and risk factors for CPM, which are not widely considered in the medical community. CPM in the setting of hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, hypophosphatemia, and alcoholism has been increasingly recognized but seldom reported in the absence of hyponatremia. Theoretically, rapid alteration of serum osmolality, as in acute hypernatremia, can overwhelm brain adaptive mechanisms and induce osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) regardless of the specific measurement of sodium.

In 2015, a case of ODS presenting with hypernatremia was published by Han et al. Overall, 50 cases have been reported in the literature, consisting of 20 case reports and 1 case series of 30 patients. It is possible that the true incidence of CPM in the setting of all the above-mentioned predisposing factors is actually higher than previously believed.

### A case of osmotic demyelination syndrome occurred after the correction of severe hyponatraemia in hyperemesis gravidarum [^112nbMdx]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a neurological disorder that can occur after the rapid correction of severe hyponatraemia. In this case, a patient suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum experienced ODS after her serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) was corrected.

- **Clinical manifestations**: The patient displayed symptoms characteristic of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) and extra-pontine myelinolysis (EPM), which are associated forms of ODS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis by revealing both pontine and extra-pontine abnormalities.

The case emphasizes the risks involved in the rapid correction of hyponatraemia and underscores the importance of careful monitoring during treatment.

### Hyperglycemia-related central pontine demyelinization following a binge-eating attack in a patient with type-2 diabetes: a case report [^113q8sG4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Central pontine demyelinization, also referred to as osmotic demyelination syndrome or central pontine myelinolysis, has been reported after increases in serum osmolality due to overcorrection of hyponatremia. A recognized pathomechanism is the increase in serum osmolality due to rapid correction of hyponatremia.

In individual cases, hyperglycemia leading to increased plasma osmolality has been attributed to causing central pontine demyelinization in patients with type-2 diabetes, and also in a patient with type-1 diabetes. This complication has also been reported in a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who displayed significant glucose fluctuations.

Here, we report a case of central pontine demyelinization in a type-2 diabetes patient who presented with severe hyperglycemia upon admission, in the absence of clinically relevant hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia.

- **Established practice**: This has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration.

We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Use of desmopressin acetate in severe hyponatremia in the intensive care unit [^111NtJp7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Excessive correction of chronic and profound hyponatremia may result in central pontine myelinolysis, causing permanent brain damage. In the case of foreseeable or established hyponatremia overcorrection, slowing down the correction rate of sodium plasma levels (PNa) or reinducing mild hyponatremia may prevent this neurologic complication.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: This retrospective and observational study was performed with 20 consecutive patients admitted to two intensive care units for severe hyponatremia, defined by PNa < 120 mmol/L and/or neurologic complications ascribable to hyponatremia. These patients were subsequently treated with desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) during the correction of hyponatremia when the rate of correction was overtly or predictably excessive. The primary endpoint was the effectiveness of DDAVP on PNa control.

- **Results**: DDAVP dramatically decreased the rate of PNa correction (median 0.81 mmol/L per hour [interquartile range, 0.46, 1.48] versus -0.02 mmol/L per hour [-0.16, 0.22] before and after DDAVP, respectively; P < 0.001), along with a decrease in urine output (650 ml/h [214, 1200] versus 93.5 ml/h [43, 143]; P = 0.003), and a rise in urine osmolarity (86 mmol/L [66, 180] versus 209 mmol/L [149, 318]; P = 0.002). The maximal magnitude of PNa variations was also markedly reduced after DDAVP administration (11.5 mmol/L [8.25, 14.5] versus 5 mmol/L [4, 6.75]; P < 0.001). No patient developed seizures after DDAVP, nor after subsequent relowering of PNa that occurred in 11 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Desmopressin acetate is an effective treatment option in managing severe hyponatremia.
