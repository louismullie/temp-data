## Question

A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care provider because of a lack of flexibility in his right hand. He has noticed that his hand has become less flexible and more fixed over the past year and he now has trouble shaking other people's hands comfortably. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis. His family history is insignificant. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. At the physician's office, his blood pressure is 118/67 mm Hg, the respirations are 18/min, the pulse is 77/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, the 4th and 5th digits are mildly flexed with dense, rope-like cords extending down his palm. Additionally, small ulcerations are identified on his palm. Which of the following is considered the first-line therapy for this condition?
A. Surgery
B. Colchicine
C. Steroid injections
D. Collagenase injections

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which first-line therapy is appropriate for a 56-year-old man with progressive hand stiffness and fixed flexion deformity of the 4th and 5th digits consistent with Dupuytren's contracture, and to choose among surgery, colchicine, steroid injections, or collagenase injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether the clinical features match Dupuytren's contracture. Then, I should verify what the FDA-approved first-line pharmacologic therapy is for this condition. Next, I will review the evidence base and mechanism of action to ensure plausibility. After that, I need to check safety considerations and contraindications, especially in the context of liver disease. Finally, I will compare the options and conclude with the most appropriate first-line choice and why the alternatives are not indicated or appropriate here.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. The description of dense, rope-like palmar cords with fixed flexion deformity of the ring and little fingers and difficulty with handshaking is classic for Dupuytren's contracture, and the presence of cirrhosis and chronic alcohol use further supports this, as Dupuytren's is a recognized extrahepatic manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease and cirrhosis, which aligns with AASLD guidance listing Dupuytren's contracture among stigmata of ALD [^1114yB7i].

> Now, I should verify the first-line pharmacologic therapy. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) is FDA-approved for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, which matches this patient's presentation, and the label details dosing, injection technique, and the need for a finger extension procedure 24–72 hours later, confirming it as the standard minimally invasive option for cord disruption in this setting [^113ETqoi].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base before concluding. The pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with collagenase achieved clinically meaningful correction of contracture to within 0–5 degrees of normal compared with placebo, with substantial improvements in range of motion, supporting its efficacy as first-line therapy for palpable cords causing functional impairment [^1169JGnt] [^114fp6bB].

> I need to check the mechanism to ensure it makes pathophysiologic sense. Dupuytren's cords are predominantly collagen; collagenase enzymatically hydrolyzes native triple-helical collagen, leading to lysis of the cord and enabling mechanical rupture with the planned extension procedure, which explains the clinical response seen in trials and practice [^114fp6bB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should confirm key risks and precautions. Serious adverse reactions include flexor tendon rupture, ligament injury, and skin laceration, with tendon rupture occurring in about 0.3% in trials; technique matters, especially for PIP cords where needle depth must be shallow and distal to the palmar digital crease to avoid tendon injury, and patients must be counseled to avoid self-manipulation and to return for the extension procedure with splinting and hand therapy afterward [^113av1b2] [^111Pcjvt] [^116hFzyS] [^111F5UWY].

> But wait, what about the patient's liver disease — does that change the choice or safety profile. I should double-check the label and pharmacokinetics. Systemic exposure after local cord injection is minimal and not quantifiable in Dupuytren's studies, and there is no hepatic metabolism warning specific to Xiaflex for this indication, so compensated cirrhosis per se is not a contraindication; nonetheless, careful patient selection and adherence to injection technique and post-procedure care remain essential [^113E7RCD].

> Next, I should review the alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a better first-line option. Surgery is effective but is generally reserved for severe, recurrent, or refractory disease or when collagenase is contraindicated or declined; it is not the first-line minimally invasive approach for a new, functionally significant cord in most patients, so choosing surgery upfront would be premature here [^notfound]. Colchicine has no role in Dupuytren's contracture and is not indicated for this condition, so that option is incorrect. Intralesional corticosteroids are not standard therapy for Dupuytren's cords and lack supportive evidence for this indication, making steroid injections inappropriate as first-line here [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the recommendation. Given a palpable cord causing fixed flexion deformity and functional impairment, collagenase injection is the FDA-approved, evidence-based first-line therapy that achieves cord lysis with a planned extension maneuver and structured hand therapy, balancing efficacy and safety when administered by experienced clinicians with appropriate precautions and patient counseling [^116NdBxw] [^1169JGnt] [^113ETqoi].

> Final answer: D. Collagenase injections [^116NdBxw].

---

The patient's presentation is classic for **Dupuytren's contracture**, with palpable cords and MCP/PIP joint contractures of the 4th and 5th digits. The **first-line therapy** for a palpable cord with a clinically significant contracture is **collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) injection** [^116NdBxw], which enzymatically disrupts the cord and improves range of motion [^116LjziU]. Surgery is reserved for severe, refractory, or recurrent disease, while colchicine and steroid injections are not indicated for Dupuytren's contracture.

---

## Clinical diagnosis and indications for treatment

Dupuytren's contracture is diagnosed clinically by the presence of palpable cords, MCP/PIP joint contractures, and a positive table-top test [^1169JGnt]. Treatment is indicated when the contracture **interferes with hand function** or causes significant disability.

---

## First-line therapy: collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex)

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) is the **FDA-approved first-line treatment** for Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord [^116NdBxw]. It is a mixture of two collagenases (AUX-I and AUX-II) that enzymatically disrupt collagen in the cord, allowing correction of the contracture [^116LjziU].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting collagenase injection

- **Randomized controlled trials**: Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) involving 374 patients demonstrated significant improvement in contracture and range of motion with collagenase injection compared to placebo [^1169JGnt] [^114fp6bB].
- **Primary endpoint**: A greater proportion of patients achieved reduction of contracture to within 0–5 degrees of normal 30 days after the last injection [^114fp6bB].
- **Adverse reactions**: Common adverse reactions include edema, contusion, injection site hemorrhage, injection site reaction, and pain in the treated extremity [^116HRCNy].

---

### Procedure and post-injection care

- **Injection**: Administered by a healthcare provider experienced in hand injections [^113ETqoi].
- **Extension procedure**: Performed 24–72 hours post-injection to facilitate cord rupture [^113ETqoi].
- **Post-procedure care**: Splinting at bedtime for up to 4 months and daily finger exercises are recommended [^111F5UWY].

---

## Alternative treatments

While collagenase injection is the **first-line therapy**, alternative treatments include:

- **Surgery**: Reserved for severe, refractory, or recurrent cases. Options include fasciectomy or fasciotomy [^1169JGnt].
- **Steroid injections**: Not indicated for Dupuytren's contracture.
- **Colchicine**: Not indicated for Dupuytren's contracture.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

The patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis does not contraindicate collagenase injection. However, careful monitoring for adverse reactions and complications is essential.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The **first-line therapy** for the patient's Dupuytren's contracture is **collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) injection** [^notfound]. This treatment is supported by robust clinical evidence, is minimally invasive, and provides significant improvement in hand function and quality of life. Surgery is reserved for severe or refractory cases, while colchicine and steroid injections are not indicated.

14.1 Dupuytren's Contracture

The efficacy of 0.58 mg of XIAFLEX was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in 374 adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2). At study entry, patients must have had: (1) a finger flexion contracture with a palpable cord of at least one finger (other than the thumb) of 20 to 100 degrees in a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or 20 to 80 degrees in a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and (2) a positive "table top test" defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. Patients could not have received a surgical treatment (e.g., fasciectomy, fasciotomy) on the selected primary joint within 90 days before the first injection of study medication and patients could not have received anticoagulation medication (except for up to 150 mg of aspirin per day) within 7 days before the first injection of study medication.

The cord affecting the selected primary joint received up to 3 injections of 0.58 mg of XIAFLEX or placebo on Days 0, 30, and 60. About 24 hours after each injection of study medication, if needed, the investigator manipulated (extended) the treated finger in an attempt to facilitate rupture of the cord (finger extension procedure). Following manipulation, patients were fitted with a splint, instructed to wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months, and instructed to perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day.

Alcohol-associated liver disease — clinical presentation and AUD recognition: There is no unique presentation of ALD that can be distinguished with confidence from other forms of liver disease, and alcohol use is often not disclosed by the affected patient, whereas liver injury, whether due to alcohol or other causes, often proceeds silently. Although not all patients with ALD meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), failure to recognize AUD remains a significant clinical problem, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion for AUD in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and signs given in Table 6. Table 6 lists symptoms such as odor of alcohol on breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, day/night reversal (sleepy by day; wakeful at night), peripheral neuropathy, weight gain (due to ascites), weight loss (due to loss of proximal muscle mass), confusion (as part of hepatic encephalopathy), loss of sexual drive, and amenorrhea, and signs including spider angioma, palmar erythema, leukonychia, ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae, loss of proximal muscle mass, systemic hypotension; tachycardia suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bruises, gynecomastia, gonadal atrophy in men, neurological findings of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (fine tremor, psychomotor agitation, transient hallucinations or illusions) and hepatic encephalopathy (coarse flapping tremor [asterixis], altered consciousness), as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Dupuytren's contracture.

g) Discard the syringe(s) and needle(s) used for reconstitution and the diluent vial(s).

Preparation Prior to Injection for Dupuytren's Contracture

a) The reconstituted XIAFLEX solution should be clear. Inspect the solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If the solution contains particulates, is cloudy, or is discolored, do not inject the reconstituted solution.

b) Administration of a local anesthetic agent prior to injection is not recommended, as it may interfere with proper placement of the XIAFLEX injection.

c) If injecting into a cord affecting the PIP joint of the fifth finger, care should be taken to inject as close to the palmar digital crease as possible (as far proximal to the digital PIP joint crease), and the needle insertion should not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth. Tendon ruptures occurred after XIAFLEX injections near the digital PIP joint crease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

d) Reconfirm the cord(s) to be injected. The site chosen for each injection should be the area where the contracting cord is maximally separated from the underlying flexor tendons and where the skin is not intimately adhered to the cord.

Table 6 shows the baseline disease characteristics of patients with Dupuytren's contracture in Studies 1 and 2.

In Studies 1 and 2, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in contracture of the selected primary joint (MP or PIP) to within 0 to 5 degrees of normal, 30 days after the last injection of that joint on Days 30, 60, or 90 (after up to 3 injections). As shown in Table 7, a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint.

The proportion of patients who achieved a contracture reduction of the primary joint to 0 to 5 degrees after the first injection was 39% and 1% in Study 1 and 27% and 5% in Study 2 in the XIAFLEX and placebo groups respectively.

XIAFLEX-treated patients, compared to placebo-treated patients, showed a greater increase from baseline in the range of motion of MP and PIP joints (see Table 8).

Recurrence

A long-term, observational, Year 2 to Year 5, follow-up study (Study 4) was undertaken to evaluate recurrence of contracture and long-term safety in subjects who received up to 8 single injections of XIAFLEX 0.58 mg in a previous Phase 3 open-label or double-blind with open-label extension study. Of the 950 patients eligible for Study 4, only 645 patients enrolled. Of the 645 patients enrolled, 30% discontinued the study. Recurrence was assessed in successfully treated joints (i.e., subjects had a reduction in contracture to 5 degrees or less at the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection of XIAFLEX in a previous study) and was defined as an increase in joint contracture by at least 20 degrees in the presence of a palpable cord, or the joint underwent medical or surgical intervention primarily to correct a new or worsening Dupuytren's contracture in that joint. Data on remaining recurrence free following successful treatment with XIAFLEX are provided in Figure 1.

5.1 Tendon Rupture or Other Serious Injury to the Injected Finger/Hand in the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture

In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tendon ruptures occurred after XIAFLEX injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Injection of XIAFLEX into collagen-containing structures such as tendons or ligaments of the hand may result in damage to those structures and possible permanent injury such as tendon rupture or ligament damage. Therefore, XIAFLEX should be injected only into the collagen cord with a MP or PIP joint contracture, and care should be taken to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structures of the hand. When injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, the needle insertion should not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth and avoid injecting more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Other XIAFLEX-associated serious local adverse reactions included pulley rupture, ligament injury, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), sensory abnormality of the hand, and skin laceration (tear). In a historically controlled post-marketing trial, the incidence of skin laceration (22%) was higher for subjects treated with two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX compared with subjects treated with up to three single injections in the placebo-controlled premarketing trials (9%). Postmarketing cases of skin laceration requiring skin graft after finger extension procedures and local skin and soft-tissue necrosis, some requiring skin grafting or, other surgical interventions including finger amputation have been reported. Signs or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the injected finger/hand should be promptly evaluated because surgical intervention may be required.

2.1 Dosage and Administration for Dupuytren's Contracture

Dosing Overview for Dupuytren's Contracture

XIAFLEX should be administered by a healthcare provider experienced in injection procedures of the hand and in the treatment of patients with Dupuytren's contracture.

XIAFLEX, supplied as a lyophilized powder, must be reconstituted with the provided diluent prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The dose of XIAFLEX is 0.58 mg per injection into a palpable cord with a contracture of a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Each vial of XIAFLEX and sterile diluent should only be used for a single injection. If two joints on the same hand are to be treated during a treatment visit, separate vials and syringes should be used for each reconstitution and injection.

Table 1 displays an overview of the volumes of sterile diluent for reconstitution and the reconstituted XIAFLEX solution to be used in the intralesional injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection, perform a finger extension procedure if a contracture persists to facilitate cord disruption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

17.1 Patient Counseling for Dupuytren's Contracture

Advise patients of the following:

Serious complications of XIAFLEX injection include tendon rupture, serious ligament damage, or skin laceration that may result in the inability to fully bend the finger and may require surgery to correct the complication.
XIAFLEX injection is likely to result in swelling, bruising, bleeding, and/or pain of the injected site and surrounding tissue.

After the XIAFLEX injections, instruct patients:

Not to flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand to reduce extravasation of XIAFLEX out of the cord(s).
Not to attempt to disrupt the injected cord(s) by self-manipulation.
To elevate the injected hand until bedtime.
To promptly contact their physician if there is evidence of infection (e.g., fever, chills, increasing redness or edema), sensory changes in the treated finger(s), trouble bending the finger(s) after the swelling goes down (symptoms of tendon rupture), or skin laceration.
To return to their healthcare provider's office 1 to 3 days after the injection visit for an examination of the injected hand and for possible finger extension procedure(s) to disrupt the cord.

Following the finger extension procedure(s) and fitting patient with a splint, instruct patients:

Not to perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until advised to do so.
To wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months.
To perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^116HRCNy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the placebo-controlled portions of Studies 1 and 2 through Day 90, 98% and 51% of XIAFLEX-treated and placebo-treated patients had an adverse reaction after up to 3 injections, respectively. Over 95% of XIAFLEX-treated patients had an adverse reaction of the injected extremity after up to 3 injections. Approximately 81% of these local reactions resolved without intervention within 4 weeks of XIAFLEX injections. The adverse reaction profile was similar for each injection, regardless of the number of injections administered. However, the incidence of pruritus increased with more injections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (≥ 25%) in the XIAFLEX clinical trials in patients with Dupuytren's contracture included edema peripheral (mostly swelling of the injected hand), contusion, injection site hemorrhage, injection site reaction, and pain in the treated extremity. Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that were reported in greater than or equal to 5% of XIAFLEX-treated patients and at a frequency greater than placebo-treated patients after up to 3 injections in the pooled placebo-controlled trials through Day 90 (Studies 1 and 2).

Some patients developed vasovagal syncope after finger extension procedures.

The safety of two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX 0.58 mg into Dupuytren's cords in the same hand was evaluated in a historically-controlled, open-label multi-center trial in 715 adult subjects with Dupuytren's contracture (Study 3). In Study 3, finger extension procedures were performed approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection. The patient demographics were similar to Studies 1 and 2.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^116LjziU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Collagenases are proteinases that hydrolyze collagen in its native triple helical conformation under physiological conditions, resulting in lysis of collagen deposits.

Injection of XIAFLEX into a Dupuytren's cord, which is comprised mostly of collagen, may result in enzymatic disruption of the cord.

The signs and symptoms of Peyronie's disease are caused by a collagen plaque. Injection of XIAFLEX into a Peyronie's plaque, which is comprised mostly of collagen, may result in enzymatic disruption of the plaque. Following this disruption of the plaque, penile curvature deformity and patient bother caused by Peyronie's disease are reduced [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Results of in vitro studies, including those of explant tissues containing Peyronie's plaques, suggest that XIAFLEX disrupts the predominant collagen found in plaques (Types I and III). At higher doses and longer incubation times, non-fibrillar Type IV collagen was affected causing collagen lysis in small veins, but did not cause structural damage to arteries, nerves or large veins which contain Type IV collagen in in vitro or in vivo studies.

Results of in vitro studies suggest that the collagenases (AUX-I and AUX-II) worked synergistically to provide hydrolyzing activity towards collagen. However, there are no clinical data regarding the relative contributions of the individual collagenases (AUX-I or AUX-II) to the efficacy of XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture or Peyronie's disease.

Collagen fragments generated from clostridial collagenase have been shown to generate increased vascular permeability, inflammatory responses, and regenerative changes. However, the effects of the formation of the collagen fragments derived from the collagen plaque are unknown.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions in patients with Dupuytren's contracture are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling:

Tendon ruptures or other serious injury to the injected extremity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

The following serious adverse reactions in patients with Peyronie's disease are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling:

Corporal rupture (penile fracture) and severe penile hematoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
In other XIAFLEX-treated patients, a combination of penile ecchymoses or hematoma, sudden penile detumescence, and/or a penile "popping" sound or sensation was reported, and in these cases, a diagnosis of corporal rupture cannot be excluded [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Patients with Dupuytren's Contracture

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Out of 1082 patients who received 0.58 mg of XIAFLEX in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the XIAFLEX studies (2630 XIAFLEX injections), 3 (0.3%) patients had a flexor tendon rupture of the treated finger within 7 days of the injection.

The data described below are based on two pooled randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials through Day 90 in patients with Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2). In these trials, patients were treated with up to 3 injections of 0.58 mg of XIAFLEX or placebo with approximately 4-week intervals between injections and the patients had finger extension procedures the day after injection, if needed, to facilitate disruption of the cord [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These trials were comprised of 374 patients of whom 249 and 125 received 0.58 mg of XIAFLEX and placebo, respectively. The mean age was 63 years, 80% were male and 20% were female, and 100% were white.

### Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) [^1131cgSd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.10 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall

Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment. Fatal cases have been reported in patients with visceral organ involvement [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients closely when vemurafenib is administered concomitantly or sequentially with radiation treatment.

5.11 Renal Failure

Renal failure, including acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis, can occur with ZELBORAF. In Trial 1, in patients with metastatic melanoma, 26% of ZELBORAF-treated patients and 5% of dacarbazine-treated patients experienced Grade 1–2 creatinine elevations [greater than 1 and up to 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)]; 1.2% of ZELBORAF-treated patients and 1.1% of dacarbazine-treated patients experienced Grade 3–4 creatinine elevations (greater than 3 times ULN).

In Trial 4, in patients with ECD, 86% (19/22) of patients experienced Grade 1/2 creatinine elevations and 9.1% (2/22) of patients experienced Grade 3 creatinine elevations.

Measure serum creatinine before initiation of ZELBORAF and periodically during treatment.

5.12 Dupuytren's Contracture and Plantar Fascial Fibromatosis

Dupuytren's contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis have been reported with ZELBORAF. The majority of cases were mild to moderate, but severe, disabling cases of Dupuytren's contracture have also been reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^114cUxVF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Out of 715 patients who received two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX 0.58 mg in the same hand (1450 XIAFLEX injections) in Study 3, one (0.1%) patient experienced a tendon rupture of the treated finger within 3 days of the injection.

Table 4 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that were reported in greater than or equal to 5% of XIAFLEX-treated patients after two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX in the same hand through Day 60 in Study 3.

Safety of Retreatment of Recurrent Contractures

An observational, open-label study was conducted in subjects who had participated in XIAFLEX clinical trials for Dupuytren's contracture (Study 4). A subset of patients who had recurrence of contracture in a joint that was previously successfully treated with XIAFLEX in Study 4 were retreated (Study 5). No new safety signals were identified among subjects who were retreated with XIAFLEX.

6.2 Clinical Studies Experience in Patients with Peyronie's Disease

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies of XIAFLEX in Peyronie's disease, 1044 patients received a total of 7466 XIAFLEX injections.

Corporal Rupture and Other Serious Penile Injury

Corporal rupture was reported as an adverse reaction after XIAFLEX injections in 5 of 1044 (0.5%) XIAFLEX treated patients.
In other XIAFLEX-treated patients (9 of 1044; 0.9%), a combination of penile ecchymoses or hematoma, sudden penile detumescence, and/or a penile "popping" sound or sensation was reported, and in these cases, a diagnosis of corporal rupture cannot be excluded. These patients were managed without surgical intervention, but the long-term consequences are unknown.
Severe penile hematoma was also reported as an adverse reaction in 39 of 1044 patients (3.7%) in the controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in Peyronie's disease [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^113E7RCD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category B

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of XIAFLEX in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, XIAFLEX should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Risk Summary

Based on animal data, XIAFLEX is not predicted to increase the risk for major developmental abnormalities in humans.

Human Data

Human pharmacokinetic studies showed that XIAFLEX levels were not quantifiable in the systemic circulation following injection into a Dupuytren's cord.

Low levels of XIAFLEX were quantifiable in the plasma of evaluable male subjects for up to 30 minutes following administration of XIAFLEX into the penile plaque of subjects with Peyronie's disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Almost all patients develop anti-product antibodies (anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II) after treatment with XIAFLEX, and the clinical significance of anti-product antibody formation on a developing fetus is not known [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Animal Data

Reproduction studies have been performed in rats with intravenous exposures up to approximately 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of XIAFLEX on a mg/m² basis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to collagenase clostridium histolyticum.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether collagenase clostridium histolyticum is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when XIAFLEX is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of XIAFLEX in pediatric patients less than 18 years old have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 249 XIAFLEX-treated patients in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2), 104 (42%) were 65 years of age or older and 9% were 75 years of age or older. Of the 551 XIAFLEX-treated patients in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in Peyronie's disease (Studies 1 and 2), 100 (18%) were 65 years of age or older and 5 (0.9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of XIAFLEX were observed between these patients and younger patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^111JEXHH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC — first-line targeted therapy preferences and handling of newly discovered rearrangements: The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib as first-line monotherapy options for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the first-line therapy options; crizotinib and entrectinib are preferred first-line therapy options because they are better tolerated, have been assessed in more patients, and are approved by the FDA. Although entrectinib has better central nervous system (CNS) penetration than crizotinib, it is more toxic. Ceritinib is an "other recommended" first-line therapy option. If ROS1 rearrangements are discovered during first-line systemic therapy, the planned therapy may be either completed or interrupted followed by crizotinib (preferred), entrectinib (preferred), or ceritinib.

### Triazolam [^113JPZFd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

5.3 XIAFLEX REMS Program

Because of the risks of corporal rupture (penile fracture) or other serious penile injury in the treatment of Peyronie's disease, XIAFLEX is available only through the XIAFLEX REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Required components of the XIAFLEX REMS Program include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training in the administration of XIAFLEX treatment for Peyronie's disease.
Healthcare sites must be certified with the program and ensure that XIAFLEX is only dispensed for use by certified prescribers.

Further information is available at www.XIAFLEXREMS.com or 1–877–313–1235.

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including
Anaphylaxis

In the controlled portions of the clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2), a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients (15%) compared to placebo-treated patients (1%) had mild allergic reactions (pruritus) after up to 3 injections. The incidence of XIAFLEX-associated pruritus increased after more XIAFLEX injections in patients with Dupuytren's contracture.

In the double-blind, placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Peyronie's disease (Studies 1 and 2), a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients (4%) compared to placebo-treated patients (1%) had localized pruritus after up to 4 treatment cycles (involving up to 8 XIAFLEX injection procedures). The incidence of XIAFLEX-associated pruritus was similar after each injection regardless of the number of injections administered.

Because XIAFLEX contains foreign proteins, severe allergic reactions to XIAFLEX can occur. Anaphylaxis was reported in a post-marketing clinical trial (Study 3) in one patient who had previous exposure to XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Some patients with Dupuytren's contracture developed IgE-anti-drug antibodies in greater proportions and higher titers with successive XIAFLEX injections. Healthcare providers should be prepared to address severe allergic reactions following XIAFLEX injections.

### Topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) [^114xTMjw]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Randomized Comparative Trial

In a randomized, comparative trial, 211 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topotecan hydrochloride (1.5 mg/m²once daily intravenously for 5 days starting on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle) or CAV (cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg/m², doxorubicin 45 mg/m², vincristine 2 mg administered sequentially on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle). All patients were considered sensitive to first-line chemotherapy (responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 60 days after completion of first-line therapy). A total of 77% of patients treated with topotecan hydrochloride and 79% of patients treated with CAV received platinum/etoposide with or without other agents as first-line chemotherapy. The efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate, response duration, time to progression or OS.

The results of the trial did not show statistically significant improvements in response rate, response duration, time to progression, or OS as shown in Table 5.

The median time to response was similar in both arms: topotecan hydrochloride, 6 weeks (2.4 weeks to 3.6 months) versus CAV, 6 weeks (5.1 weeks to 4.2 months).

Changes on a disease-related symptom scale are presented in Table 6. It should be noted that not all patients had all symptoms, nor did all patients respond to all questions. Each symptom was rated on a 4-category scale with an improvement defined as a change in 1 category from baseline sustained over 2 courses. Limitations in interpretation of the rating scale and responses preclude formal statistical analysis.

Single-Arm Trials

Topotecan hydrochloride was also studied in three open-label, non-comparative trials (Studies 014, 092 and 053) in a total of 319 patients with recurrent or progressive SCLC after treatment with first-line chemotherapy. In all three trials, patients were stratified as either sensitive (responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 90 days after completion of first-line therapy) or refractory (no response to first-line chemotherapy or who responded to first-line therapy and then progressed within 90 days of completing first-line therapy). Response rates ranged from 11% to 31% for sensitive patients and 2% to 7% for refractory patients. Median time to progression and median survival were similar in all three trials and the comparative trial.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^114TiSYe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Syncope and Presyncope

Cases of syncope and presyncope have been reported in the postmarketing period in patients treated with XIAFLEX.

Most, but not all, cases in patients with Peyronie's disease, occurred in association with post-injection penile pain and hematoma, penile pain with spontaneous erections, and pain during micturition. These potential triggers for the syncopal events suggest a vasovagal mechanism. Make Peyronie's disease patients aware of the potential for penile pain and painful penile hematoma that could trigger syncope and presyncope after treatment with XIAFLEX.

In most cases in patients with Dupuytren's Contracture, the injection procedure, finger extension procedure, or pain following the procedures were reported as potential triggers for the events, suggesting a vasovagal mechanism. Most, but not all cases in patients with Dupuytren's contracture, occurred in the immediate treatment period (injection or finger extension procedure) or within 1 to 2 days following the injection or finger extension procedure.

If presyncopal symptoms occur, patients should remain recumbent until symptoms resolve. Syncope may be associated with bodily injuries, including concussion, head abrasion, and other accidental injuries.

### Abiraterone acetate [^111TpKrc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound in sports medicine [^114aAkx3]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) procedures are organized into "3 broad categories, or generations", with first-generation techniques that "apply US guidance to improve the accuracy of established procedures such as joint injections, peritendinous injections, and perineural injections" and that have expanded with agents "including but not limited to dextrose, autologous blood, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP)". Second-generation techniques "have predominately emerged during the past decade and can be generally considered to be advanced procedures performed with commonly available needles", with common examples including "needle tenotomy/fasciotomy for chronic tendinosis/fasciosis, fenestration of the transverse carpal ligament to treat carpal tunnel syndrome, neovessel ablation through sclerosing agent injection or mechanical disruption to treat chronic tendinosis" and "needle release of the A1 pulley for trigger finger, needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren contracture, and hydrodissection to treat peripheral neuritis due to mild compression or adhesions"; "before the widespread adoption of US guidance, these procedures either did not exist or were performed relatively rarely", whereas "many of these procedures are being increasingly used on a regular basis". Third-generation techniques "are characterized by the use of preexisting, specialized surgical tools or specially designed devices to perform a specific US-guided procedure", "duplicate well-accepted surgical procedures using percutaneous US guidance", and include "A1 pulley release using hook knives, carpal tunnel release using hook knives, arthroscopic equipment, or specially designed devices, and tenotomy/fasciotomy using specialized devices that not only cut but also debride damaged tissue". The trend is that "the current trend toward expanded applications of interventional MSK US can be expected to continue for decades", with "many traditional surgical procedures will become office-based, lower cost procedures" and some "combined with precise delivery of therapeutic-regenerative agents".

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^112zX6r3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States". Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD". "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver". Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD", and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC".

### Probability of cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C… [^114cMNHA]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How likely is cirrhosis in a patient with hepatitis C. Applying the Evidence: Richard is a 42-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. He has no spider nevi, and laboratory test results are as follows: aspartate transaminase level, 32 U per L; γ-glutamyltransferase level, 92 U per L; total cholesterol level, 250 mg per dL; and platelet count, 240 × 10³ per mm³. What is the probability that he has cirrhosis. Because the score is less than 4. 2, Richard has a low likelihood of having cirrhosis. Evidence Summary Hepatitis C is a growing health concern. An estimated 3. 9 million persons in the United States are infected with hepatitis C virus;
2. 7 million of these persons have chronic infection. 1, 2 Cirrhosis develops in approximately 7 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

1, 2 Patients with significant fibrosis are at higher risk for progression to cirrhosis and are candidates for antiviral therapy. Patients with cirrhosis may benefit from screening for hepatocellular cancer, although the actual benefit of screening remains unproved.

1. Three clinical decision rules estimate the likelihood of fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The estimated likelihood of these conditions can be a factor in deciding whether to order a liver biopsy and in prioritizing patients for screening for hepatic carcinoma and other complications of hepatitis C. For example, patients with a very low probability of fibrosis may choose to forego liver biopsy because they are unlikely to benefit from antiviral treatment. The three clinical decision rules were chosen because they were validated in a new set of patients.

The major limitation of the three clinical decision guides is that they have not been validated in the primary care or community setting. Thus, they may overestimate the likelihood of the development of cirrhosis over a 20-year period in community-based patients. Most patients with fibrosis do not develop cirrhosis, and patients with persistently normal hepatic transaminase levels were unlikely to be included in the studies.

### Preventive strategies in chronic liver disease: part I. alcohol… [^115U8PEo]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

7 Other recognized categories of chronic liver disease include conditions induced by toxins or drugs and autoimmune chronic liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. Chronic liver disease also includes hereditary diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and a group of liver diseases with no identifiable cause. Chronic liver disease cannot be cured. Hence, it is imperative to prevent further exacerbation of the disease and to optimize the length of time between hepatitis and the development of cirrhosis. This article reviews preventive measures that have been shown to be effective or to have a scientific rationale in the management of chronic liver disease.

Preventive Strategies ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL Alcohol consumption has been associated with alcoholic hepatitis, fatty infiltration of the liver, accelerated progression of liver disease, a higher frequency of cirrhosis, a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The daily consumption of more than four drinks of alcohol increases the risk of cirrhosis, as well as death from other causes. 12 found that the effect of alcohol in patients with hepatitis C virus infection is not merely additive but synergistic, and that even moderate use of alcohol can hasten the development of cirrhosis. The mechanism for the synergistic effect of alcohol and hepatitis C virus is not fully understood, but it has been attributed to the effects of alcohol on viral replication and the immune system, hepatic iron content and hepatic regeneration.

Other investigators 13 have found that alcohol abuse in patients with hepatitis C virus infection is associated with a decreased response to interferon therapy. INFLUENCE OF IRON Patients with chronic liver disease have a tendency to accumulate an excessive amount of iron in their liver parenchyma. Those with alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or hepatitis C virus infection have a particular tendency toward secondary hemosiderosis. Patients who have secondary iron overload must be distinguished from those with hereditary hemochromatosis, in which a primary genetic defect leads to an excessive hepatic and total-body iron load. The level of iron loading is much greater in patients with primary hemochromatosis than in those with secondary hemosiderosis.
