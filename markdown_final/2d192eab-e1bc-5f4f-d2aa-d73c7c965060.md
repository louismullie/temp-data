## Question

[ Percentage and ratio problems ]

After the crisis, all prices increased by $25 \%$. By what percentage fewer goods can be bought with the same salary?

#

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much less can be purchased with the same salary after a 25% price increase across all goods. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core relationship between price, quantity, and total expenditure. Then, I should verify the mathematical derivation to compute the percentage reduction in quantity. Next, I will consider real-world implications and whether substitution or income effects matter. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly with a concise explanation.

> Let me first confirm the economic logic. If prices rise by 25%, the same nominal salary will buy fewer units of goods unless consumers substitute to cheaper alternatives or reduce overall consumption, so the question is essentially asking for the percentage decline in purchasing power holding nominal income constant and assuming no substitution or quality adjustment, which is a pure price-effect calculation [^notfound].

> I will now examine the algebra. Let the original price per unit be P and the original quantity purchasable with salary S be Q, so S = P × Q. After a 25% price increase, the new price is 1.25P, and the new quantity Q′ that can be bought with the same salary satisfies S = 1.25P × Q′. Solving for Q′ gives Q′ = Q / 1.25 = 0.8Q, meaning the consumer can now buy 80% of the original quantity, which is a 20% reduction in quantity purchased [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the percentage calculation so I don't misstate it. The reduction is Q − Q′ = Q − 0.8Q = 0.2Q, so the percentage fewer goods is (0.2Q / Q) × 100% = 20%. Yes, that checks out arithmetically and aligns with the inverse relationship between price and quantity when expenditure is fixed [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about real-world behavior. In practice, consumers may respond by substituting to less expensive goods, reducing consumption, or drawing on savings, so the actual decline in utility could be smaller than 20% if substitution mitigates the hit, but the question is framed as a pure purchasing-power exercise, so the correct answer remains 20% fewer goods at the same salary with no behavioral adjustment assumed [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating this with elasticity concepts. Elasticity measures the percentage change in quantity demanded for a 1% price change and would incorporate behavioral responses; here, we are solving a budget-constraint identity rather than estimating demand elasticity, so the 20% figure is exact for the stated assumptions and does not depend on estimating an elasticity coefficient [^notfound].

> Final answer: With a 25% increase in all prices and the same salary, you can buy 20% fewer goods [^notfound].

---

The answer is **20%**. When prices rise by 25%, the same salary buys 20% fewer goods because purchasing power is inversely proportional to price. Mathematically, a 25% price increase means each unit costs 1.25 times more, so the quantity affordable with a fixed salary falls to 1/1.25 = 0.8, which is a 20% reduction [^notfound].

---

## Mathematical explanation

Let the original price of a good be (P) and the original quantity that can be purchased with a salary (S) be (Q). Then:

[
S = P \\times Q
]

After a 25% price increase, the new price is (P_{\\text{new}} = P \\times 1.25). The new quantity (Q_{\\text{new}}) that can be purchased with the same salary is:

[
Q_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{S}{P_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{S}{P \\times 1.25} = \\frac{Q}{1.25} = 0.8Q
]

The reduction in quantity is:

[
Q - Q_{\\text{new}} = Q - 0.8Q = 0.2Q
]

Expressed as a percentage, this is a **20% reduction** in the quantity of goods that can be purchased.

---

## Intuitive explanation

A 25% price increase means that each unit now costs 1.25 times as much. Therefore, the same salary can only buy (\\frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8) times the original quantity, which is a 20% reduction.

---

## Real-world implications

This 20% reduction in purchasing power has **significant real-world implications**:

- **Reduced standard of living**: Consumers may need to cut back on discretionary spending or find cheaper alternatives.
- **Increased financial strain**: Households may face difficulties meeting basic needs, especially if salaries do not keep pace with inflation.
- **Shift in consumption patterns**: Consumers may prioritize essential goods and services, delaying or forgoing non-essential purchases.

---

## Factors influencing the impact

Several factors can **mitigate or exacerbate** the impact of a 25% price increase:

- **Salary adjustments**: If salaries increase in line with inflation, the impact on purchasing power may be minimal.
- **Substitution effect**: Consumers may switch to cheaper alternatives, reducing the overall impact.
- **Savings and credit**: Access to savings or credit can temporarily cushion the impact.

---

## Conclusion

When prices increase by 25%, the same salary can buy **20% fewer goods**. This reduction in purchasing power can significantly affect consumers' standard of living and financial stability.

### Sustained decline in tobacco purchasing in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic [^d07e2231]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We find evidence that financial concerns may be partially driving the decline in tobacco use but do not fully explain it. Comparing estimates with and without controlling for price, we estimate that prices explain about 25% of the total decline in cigarette use during the pandemic. Using our data, we find evidence of price increases starting in week 27 of 2020 through the end of the year (see Supplementary Fig. S4). The increase is due to a national tax increase on cigarettes which came into effect on April 1 st (week 14) but did not immediately affect prices due to retailers stocking up tobacco packages subject to the lower taxation rate. We estimate that prices increased by about 29% percent compared to the same period in 2019, and a price elasticity of 0.55 among regular smokers – which is in line with existing literature. We conduct a sensitivity analysis examining the effects of the pandemic prior to the price change in week 27 and find a similar impact of COVID-19 on cigarette purchases (Supplementary Table S7).

To examine the net effect of price and quantity changes, we estimate the impact of the pandemic on money spent on cigarettes (Supplementary Table S8). We find significant reductions in both the full population and all subgroups of smokers, with regular smokers spending an estimated $3.15 less per week on cigarettes (p < 0.001), a 24% decrease compared to an average of $12.87 during the same period in 2019. We conclude that price is partially driving the decrease in purchases but does not fully explain the decline. Relatedly, changes in financial security could affect demand for cigarettes. We are not able to control for changes in income (or other time-varying characteristics), but we note that in Denmark the overall unemployment rate only increased from 3.7% in 2019 to 4.6% in 2020 and salaries grew 2.5% (from the official statistics from Statistics Denmark).

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4f494f4f]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main Body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5204208e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug’s temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

### The health, poverty, and financial consequences of a cigarette price increase among 500 million male smokers in 13 middle income countries: compartmental model study [^1918d1db]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Price effects on smoking

In the main analyses we estimated the cumulative number of smokers who would quit as a consequence of a one-time 50% increase in the retail price of cigarettes. Quitting is a function of price elasticity of demand for cigarettes, age, and income. Studies on cigarette price elasticity (defined by the percentage reduction in cigarette consumption resulting from a specific increase in price) have mostly been done in high income countries but are increasingly available for low and middle income countries.Price elasticity estimates vary widely across countries, time periods, and study design, but reviews of all reliable evidence from both high income countries and low and middle income countries found that elasticity estimates fall within the range of −0.2 to −0.6, or an average of −0.4.The small number of studies in low and middle income countries found smokers to be at least as sensitive (and often more sensitive) to price than smokers in high income countries. A price elasticity of −0.4 implies about a 20% decrease in smoking with a 50% price increase. Of the reduction, roughly half (10%) is attributable to quitting by current smokers and half to fewer cigarettes smoked. Economic theory predicts that those on a low income and young people should be more sensitive to price than others, and this has been well documented in high income countries and in the more limited literature from low and middle income countries.Price responsiveness in young people and among smokers on a low income is about twice as great as it is in older people and smokers on a high income.The International Agency for Research on Cancer found all 18 price elasticity studies in low and middle income countries reviewed to show a gradient by income or education.

We applied a relative weighted price elasticity matrix by age and income group to all estimates. Hence price elasticity in younger smokers (age 15-24 years) in the bottom income group was −1.27 whereas in smokers aged 25 or more in the top group it was −0.24. We applied the higher price elasticity to future smokers aged less than 15 years who have not yet started to smoke. Sensitivity analyses examined the key outcomes by excluding China and India (as these have more than two thirds of the male smokers of all 13 countries in the study), including the three countries (Chile, Colombia, and Mexico) with notable smoking in females, and testing price increases by 25% and 100% with the above elasticities. We also applied country specific price elasticities (see supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4).

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^81af00b9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers—a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin.It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome.Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers’ power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender.Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale.For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998-2002).Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

### Price and utilization: why we must target both to curb health care costs [^4663c174]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The United States spends nearly $8000 per person on health care annually. Even for a wealthy country, this amount is substantially more than would be expected and 2.5 times the average spent by other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The growth rate of health care spending in the United States has also far outpaced that in all other high-income OECD countries since 1970, even accounting for population growth. This increase in health spending threatens to squeeze out critical investments in education and infrastructure. To successfully develop and implement policies that effectively address both the level and growth of U.S. health care costs, it is critical to first understand cost drivers. Many health policy and economics scholars have contributed to an ongoing debate on whether to blame high prices or high utilization of services for escalating health care spending in the United States. This paper argues that price and volume both contribute to high and increasing health care costs, along with high administrative costs, supply issues, and the fee-for-service payment system. Initial strategies to contain costs might include implementation and expansion of bundled payment systems and competitive bidding.

Improving strategies for price benchmarking

An important factor in determining a fair price for a medicine is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a given clinical benefit. Buyers have used several different methods to benchmark medicine prices and facilitate purchasing. None of these strategies alone will achieve lower prices, but the recent drive for additional transparency and collaboration has made buyers more active purchasers in determining what is fair in their goal of achieving access for their populations.

Setting a benchmark using price information from other countries, with similar socioeconomic status, is one method that buyers have used to control costs—known as external reference pricing. This method generally uses a declared list price that can differ substantially from the actual price paid, given confidential discounts and rebates.The widespread use of external reference pricing, particularly in Europe,has been criticised because of its reliance on list price. The interconnected web of countries referencing each other’s prices has potentially affected launch sequencing across countries, thereby directly affecting patient access.

### Introducing taxes, subsidies or both: the effects of various food pricing strategies in a web-based supermarket randomized trial [^8ed2506e]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Fiscal policies may form a solution in improving dietary intake. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of varying taxing and subsiding schemes to stimulate healthier food purchases.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial with three levels of price reduction on healthy foods (no; 25%; 50%)×three levels of price increase on unhealthy foods (5%; 10%; 25%) factorial design was used. 150 participants were randomized into one of nine conditions and were asked to purchase groceries at a web-based supermarket. Data were collected in the Netherlands in January-February 2010 and analyzed using analysis of covariance.

Results

Subjects receiving 50% discount purchased significantly more healthy foods than subjects receiving no (mean difference=6.62 items, p<0.01) or 25% discount (mean difference=4.87 items, p<0.05). Moreover, these subjects purchased more vegetables (mean difference=821 g;p<0.05 compared to no discount). However, participants with the highest discount also purchased significantly more calories. No significant effects of the price increases on unhealthy foods were found.

Conclusion

Price decreases are effective in stimulating healthy food purchases, but the proportion of healthy foods remains unaffected. Price increases up to 25% on unhealthier products do not significantly affect food purchases. Future studies are important to validate these results in real supermarkets and across different countries.

### The price of acute care surgery [^70313ffb]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous organizations have identified access to emergency surgical care as a crisis. One barrier is the financial disincentive associated with caring for this patient population. We sought to identify contributing factors by analyzing endemic data during the development of an acute care surgery (ACS) service at an academic health care system.

Methods

Financial data (receipts, payer mix, and dollar/relative value unit [RVU]) and productivity measures (OR procedures and RVUs) were obtained for a surgical division for 6-month periods before and after transition to an ACS model. Using national data, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify salary targets required for an ACS surgeon to have equitable career reimbursement using standard financial modeling (net present value) with comparable surgical specialists.

Results

Post-ACS, operative volume increased 25%, work RVUs increased 21%, but net receipts increased only 11%. Dollar/RVU decreased primarily due to a higher proportion of uncompensated care. As a result, the dollar/RVU for ACS patients was 28% lower in comparison to non-ACS specialties. Increasing ACS salaries proportionate to the observed dollar/RVU discount realigned ACS economic value with other specialties in aggregate.

Conclusion

A national shortage of ACS surgeons exists due to in part financial misalignment. We demonstrated that despite an increase in clinical activity, transition to an ACS model resulted in a relative reduction in payment. A rational systems-based approach to ACS development that objectively targets the RVU reimbursement disparity would reduce economic disincentives related to careers in ACS and potentially address the emergency surgical care crisis.

### Characteristics and price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States, 2008 to 2018 [^a57b2e89]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Primary Outcomes

Approximately one-third of drug products (95 of 300 [31.7%]) had prices that increased by 25% or more during any calendar year, and approximately one-quarter of drug products (66 of 300 [22.0%]) had prices that increased by 50% or more during any calendar year (Table 1). For drugs with a price increase of 25% or more, we observed 206 price increases during the study period, averaging 2.2 price increases of those experiencing at least 1; similarly, for drugs with a price increase of 50% or more, we observed 103 price increases during the study period, averaging 1.6 price increases.

An initial price of less than $2 per unit (aOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.69-3.29), antineoplastic and immunomodulatory class (aOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.31-5.65), dermatologic class (aOR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.80-4.84), oral route (aOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.45-2.79), the presence of 2 FDA indications (aOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.25-2.28), and FDA approval before 1990 (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14-2.03) were attributes more likely to be associated with a 25% or more price increase in a calendar year after adjusting for by initial price compared with the average of all attributes. These results are summarized in Table 4.

### Trends and affordability of cigarette prices: ample room for tax increases and related health gains [^85d6747d]. Tobacco Control (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing the price of tobacco products is arguably the most effective method of curbing the prevalence and consumption of tobacco products. Price increases would reduce the global burden of disease brought about by tobacco consumption.

Objectives

To compare cigarette price data from more than 80 countries using varying methods, examine trends in prices and affordability during the 1990s, and explore various policy implications pertaining to tobacco prices.

Design

March 2001 cigarette price data from the Economist Intelligence Unit are used to compare cigarette prices across countries. To facilitate comparison and to assess affordability, prices are presented in US dollars, purchasing power parity (PPP) units using the Big Mac index as an indicator of PPP and in terms of minutes of labour required to purchase a pack of cigarettes. Annual real percentage changes in cigarette prices between 1990 and 2000 and annual changes in the minutes of labour required to buy cigarettes between 1991 and 2000 are also calculated to examine trends.

Results

Cigarette prices tend to be higher in wealthier countries and in countries that have strong tobacco control programmes. On the other hand, minutes of labour required to purchase cigarettes vary vastly between countries. Trends between 1990 and 2000 in real prices and minutes of labour indicate, with some exceptions, that cigarettes have become more expensive in most developed countries but more affordable in many developing countries. However, in the UK, despite recent increases in price, cigarettes are still more affordable than they were in the 1960s.

Conclusions

The results suggest that there is ample room to increase tobacco prices through taxation. In too many countries, cigarette prices have failed to keep up with increases in the general price level of goods and services, rendering them more affordable in 2000 than they were at the beginning of the decade. Opportunities to increase government revenue and improve health through reduced consumption brought about by higher prices have been overlooked in many countries.

### Potential impact on prevalence of obesity in the UK of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks: modelling study [^60ed4655]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To estimate the potential impact on body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks.

Design

Modelling study.

Setting

General adult population of the United Kingdom.

Participants

36 324 households with data on product level household expenditure from UK Kantar FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) panel for January 2012 to December 2013. Data were used to estimate changes in energy (kcal, 1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) purchase associated with a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks. Data for 2544 adults from waves 5 to 8 of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2012-16) were used to estimate resulting changes in BMI and prevalence of obesity.

Main outcome measures

The effect on per person take home energy purchases of a 20% price increase for three categories of high sugar snacks: confectionery (including chocolate), biscuits, and cakes. Health outcomes resulting from the price increase were measured as changes in weight, BMI (not overweight (BMI <25), overweight (BMI ≥25 and <30), and obese (BMI ≥30)), and prevalence of obesity. Results were stratified by household income and BMI.

Results

For income groups combined, the average reduction in energy consumption for a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks was estimated to be 8.9×10 3 kcal (95% confidence interval −13.1×10 3 to −4.2×10 3 kcal). Using a static weight loss model, BMI was estimated to decrease by 0.53 (95% confidence interval −1.01 to −0.06) on average across all categories and income groups. This change could reduce the UK prevalence of obesity by 2.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval −3.7 to −1.7 percentage points) after one year. The impact of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks on energy purchase was largest in low income households classified as obese and smallest in high income households classified as not overweight.

Conclusions

Increasing the price of high sugar snacks by 20% could reduce energy intake, BMI, and prevalence of obesity. This finding was in a UK context and was double that modelled for a similar price increase in sugar sweetened beverages.

### Evaluation of economic and health outcomes associated with food taxes and subsidies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ffbefc31]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The synthesis of results proceeded in 2 stages. When a meta-analysis was feasible, we used it on results of studies with complete data. Studies with missing data, that lacked statistical testing, or with duplicate results (ie, multiple publications of the same studies) were excluded from the meta-analysis and included in the narrative analysis. For outcomes with few available studies (<7) or with high heterogeneity across types of policies and measures, we analyzed the studies in a narrative synthesis only.

Study estimates in the pooled meta-analysis were combined using a price elasticity measure for sales and consumption and calculated as a percentage change in demand over a percentage change in price. Postintervention percentage change in price was calculated as a percentage discount provided by the subsidy. Elasticities and their CIs were computed from relative changes in demand by dividing the estimated percentage changes in demand and corresponding CIs by the percentage changes in price. eAppendix 2 in the Supplement provides details on the computation of the price elasticity measures.

The meta-analysis was conducted to generate pooled effect size estimates using restricted maximum likelihood for estimating τ 2. We used Hartung-Knapp–adjusted, 3-level random-effects models to account for the expected high between-study heterogeneity and for some studies with more than 1 effect size (ie, effect sizes were clustered within studies).The proportion of the variance explained was assessed using the I 2 statistic.In addition, 95% prediction intervals were estimated to identify the expected range of true effect sizes in similar studies, providing a measure that accounts for both the variance in the estimated outcome and the between-study heterogeneity (τ 2).

For the outcomes in the meta-analysis, publication bias was assessed using the Egger test.The meta-analysis was conducted in R, version 4.1.0using the meta package version 4.19,with the 95% prediction intervals calculated using the metafor packageand auxiliary functions from the dmetar package, version 0.09.000(R Foundation for Statistical Computing). In the narrative synthesis, the results were aggregated by the direction of estimated results (increase or decrease) and statistical significance of the estimates.

### Effects of minimum unit pricing for alcohol on different income and socioeconomic groups: a modelling study [^72f43692]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1 
Absolute numbers and proportion of total alcohol units purchased for less than a £0·45 MUP by drinker and income quintile and by beverage type

Absolute numbers exclude units of on-trade alcohol (eg, units purchased in bars or restaurants) and off-trade (eg, shop-bought) ready-to-drink beverages because these beverages account for less than 1% of each subgroup's units purchased for less than £0·45. MUP=minimum unit price.

In our analysis, a £0·45 minimum unit price led to an overall estimated reduction in population alcohol consumption of −1·6% (−12 units per drinker per year; table 2, figure 2). Substantial heterogeneity existed in the results between groups, with much larger reductions in harmful drinkers than in moderate or hazardous drinkers (table 2). Consumption in the lowest income group was estimated to decrease by more than 4% and smaller reductions were seen as incomes increased; especially in the upper two quintiles in which the decrease was estimated to be less than −1%. Consumption in harmful drinkers was estimated to decrease in all income groups with by far the largest decrease in individuals with the lowest incomes, although smaller decreases were also estimated for the highest income group (table 2). The estimated effect on moderate drinkers was much smaller than it was for heavier drinkers with less variation across the income distribution (table 2). We noted much the same results in sensitivity analyses (figure 2, appendix).

### Overall and income specific effect on prevalence of overweight and obesity of 20% sugar sweetened drink tax in UK: econometric and comparative risk assessment modelling study [^a93f8d67]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Modelling step 1—effect of tax rises on drink purchases

To simulate the effect of a tax induced price rise, we estimated price elasticities. These measure the change in quantity demanded (purchased) if the price of the product itself changes (own price elasticity) or the price of another product changes (cross price elasticity). For example, an own price elasticity of −0.9 for sugar sweetened drinks indicates that a 10% increase in the price results in a 9% lower consumption of such drinks, whereas a cross price elasticity of 0.2 between sugar sweetened drinks and milk indicates that a 10% higher price of sugar sweetened drinks leads to milk consumption being higher by 2%, implying that milk is a substitute for sugar sweetened drinks.

We estimated elasticities by applying a Bayesian approach to estimate an almost ideal demand system.This approach ensures that the substitution patterns estimated are consistent across the different food and drink groups in the model: an increase in expenditure in one good must be matched by an appropriate reduction in expenditure on another good. We also used a modified approach to allow for the possibility that within the two week survey period of the Living Costs and Food Survey, observed purchases may differ from actual demand as stocks are either built up or run down, by treating quantity demanded as a latent variable.Model estimation was carried out with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, during which latent quantities were estimated by using data augmentation.

We aggregated the Living Costs and Food Survey drinks groups into groups as set out in figure 2for the purposes of simulating the effects of a sugar sweetened drink tax. However, estimating a single demand system for these groups was not possible. We therefore adopted the hierarchical approach depicted in figure 2and estimated five demand systems. The elasticities that result from this estimation are conditional and assume that the change in quantity resulting from a change in price takes place with expenditure on all of the goods in the given demand system remaining constant. To relax this assumption, we calculated unconditional elasticities.Unconditional elasticities allow expenditure on a group to change in response to a price change within that group. They allow, for example, an increase in expenditure on sugar sweetened drinks in response to a rise in their price that is offset by reducing expenditure on another food or drinks group.

### Potential impact on prevalence of obesity in the UK of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks: modelling study [^146e6965]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate the potential impact on body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks.

Design

Modelling study.

Setting

General adult population of the United Kingdom.

Participants

36324 households with data on product level household expenditure from UK Kantar FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) panel for January 2012 to December 2013. Data were used to estimate changes in energy (kcal, 1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) purchase associated with a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks. Data for 2544 adults from waves 5 to 8 of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2012-16) were used to estimate resulting changes in BMI and prevalence of obesity.

Main Outcome Measures

The effect on per person take home energy purchases of a 20% price increase for three categories of high sugar snacks: confectionery (including chocolate), biscuits, and cakes. Health outcomes resulting from the price increase were measured as changes in weight, BMI (not overweight (BMI <25), overweight (BMI ≥25 and <30), and obese (BMI ≥30)), and prevalence of obesity. Results were stratified by household income and BMI.

Results

For income groups combined, the average reduction in energy consumption for a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks was estimated to be 8.9×10 3 kcal (95% confidence interval -13.1×10 3 to -4.2×10 3 kcal). Using a static weight loss model, BMI was estimated to decrease by 0.53 (95% confidence interval -1.01 to -0.06) on average across all categories and income groups. This change could reduce the UK prevalence of obesity by 2.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval -3.7 to -1.7 percentage points) after one year. The impact of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks on energy purchase was largest in low income households classified as obese and smallest in high income households classified as not overweight.

Conclusions

Increasing the price of high sugar snacks by 20% could reduce energy intake, BMI, and prevalence of obesity. This finding was in a UK context and was double that modelled for a similar price increase in sugar sweetened beverages.

### How income and food prices influence global dietary intakes by age and sex: evidence from 164 countries [^74be673f]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

How do our findings compare to previous studies? Given the level of aggregation in prior studies, exact comparisons are not straightforward. We do find important similarities, however, even though many prior studies used expenditure or disappearance data. For instance, the relative higher responsiveness of SSA and lower income countries to income changes is consistent with previous findings.But overall, our income elasticities are lower on average, particularly for high-income countries. This may reflect that at higher income levels, an increase in income results in increased demand for quality rather than quantity. Own-price elasticities are more comparable for some groups. For instance, our estimates for fish (−0.4 to −1.0) generally fall within the confidence intervals reported in prior studies.The main differences in results are that (1) we found more goods that exhibited declining intake in response to rising incomes (ie, inferior goods), (2) we found fewer statistically significant relationships for a large number of food categories, particularly in higher income regions, and (3) whereas in prior studies, income and price elasticities mostly decrease with national income, we identified intake categories where this was not the case (eg, fruit intake in response to income changes, and milk intake in response to price changes).

Increasing the affordability of healthful foods has been considered a key strategy for national and international organisations.Our findings suggest that increasing income and/or reducing prices would likely increase fruit intake globally, but would have distinct benefits for men and women of all ages and across most countries, with potentially stronger effects of lower prices in certain regions and among younger men, and of higher income among older women. The latter results are consistent with within-country evaluations in which age positively correlates with nutritional knowledge and better diet choices, and in which women are more likely than men to make healthier dietary purchases with additional income.In contrast to fruits, our results suggest that vegetable intake may not significantly increase with higher incomes, and that intake of some plant-based foods (beans/legumes, nuts/seeds) might actually decrease in some regions. Beans/legumes may plausibly be considered an inferior good in many parts of the world, particular when considered by people as a protein source.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^b99cc5e7]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Improving strategies for selection and coverage

Buyers have developed several tools to ensure that a new single source medicine reaches appropriate patients. Budget and systems planning can ensure that price negotiations begin with an accurate forecast of the need for, and potential benefit of, a new medicine within a population. Many clinical benefits of a new medicine are common across countries, although their manner of use may need to be adapted to national situations. Thus, strategies for selection and coverage are an area ripe for improvement through additional collaboration and transparency.

Many health systems use horizon scanning for early awareness of medicines that could enter a market. In this way, buyers gain sufficient lead time to analyse the potential effect of a new medicine on the health system and develop strategies to cope with its introduction.Medicines can be prioritised for further review based on criteria such as potential health benefit, potential to trigger system changes, and unit cost or effect on the budget.Horizon scanning is administratively burdensome, but information gathering can be a collaborative effort. For example, nine European countries to date are collaborating in establishing the International Horizon Scanning Initiative.

The World Health Organization recommends that countries use health technology assessment as a tool to support decision making about reimbursement, price setting, and negotiation. The assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit and scientifically robust methods to weigh up the value of using a health technology, such as at launch, when additional real world evidence about its use is available, and once competitor products reach the market. However, health technology assessment requires significant resources, including staff with training in health economics who can critically assess technical dossiers. Countries looking to introduce such assessment should take a stepwise approach to developing legislative and technical capacity to take full advantage of it in pharmaceutical price setting and reimbursement. National academic institutions can help in developing capacity and can serve as external reviewers and train health technology assessors.

Buyers can extract larger discounts from manufacturers by threatening to offer only limited coverage for a medicine, or to leave it out of a benefit package, national list, or formulary. Without an agreement there is no market. In the US, both the Veterans Health Administration and the Department of Defense negotiate lower prices directly with manufacturers, using formularies to manage which medicines they cover.

### The health, poverty, and financial consequences of a cigarette price increase among 500 million male smokers in 13 middle income countries: compartmental model study [^422b2d46]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Next we estimated the treatment costs averted due to reduced tobacco attributable death. All costs and prices were in US dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity and expressed in inflation adjusted terms for 2015.We apportioned the calculated reductions in deaths from the above procedure across four main causes of smoking attributable mortality: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, heart disease, and cancers (ignoring tuberculosis). We used global burden of disease estimates of the mortality proportions for these four diseases,validated with the local epidemiological evidence if available (see supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4).

We derived the annual treatment cost for each country for these four conditions for 2015 (adjusted for purchasing power parity)from peer reviewed studies or country reports (see supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4). The treatment cost averted was a function of the reduced number of cause specific deaths attributable to tobacco. We quantified the number of men avoiding catastrophic healthcare expenditures using the WHO definition (out-of-pocket costs >10% of an individual’s yearly income)and extreme poverty as when out-of-pocket costs reduce daily income below the World Bank definition (<$1.90/day).Because the comparable average individual’s yearly income within each income group were not readily available for all 13 countries, we created a probability distribution of catastrophic expenditures and extreme poverty from an income distribution function for each country based on the Gini coefficient and average per capita household income (see supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4).

Finally, to estimate the value of taxes gained from additional tax revenues from cigarette price increases, we used WHO estimates of country specific data on price per pack of cigarettes ($ purchasing power parity), tobacco tax incidence as a percentage of final price, and average cigarette sticks consumed by smokers each day across income groups.We used STATA version 13.0 for the analyses.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures nor were they involved in developing plans for implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of cap and co-payment on rational use of medicines [^63de4728]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Growing expenditures on prescription medicines represent a major challenge to many health systems. Cap and co-payment policies are intended as an incentive to deter unnecessary or marginal utilisation, and to reduce third-party payer expenditures by shifting parts of the financial burden from insurers to patients, thus increasing their financial responsibility for prescription medicines. Direct patient payment policies include caps (maximum numbers of prescriptions or medicines that are reimbursed), fixed co-payments (patients pay a fixed amount per prescription or medicine), co-insurance (patients pay a percentage of the price), ceilings (patients pay the full price or part of the cost up to a ceiling, after which medicines are free or are available at reduced cost) and tier co-payments (differential co-payments usually assigned to generic and brand medicines). This is the first update of the original review.

Objectives

To determine the effects of cap and co-payment (cost-sharing) policies on use of medicines, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the following databases and websites: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Library; MEDLINE, Ovid; EMBASE, Ovid; IPSA, EBSCO; EconLit, ProQuest; Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, ProQuest; PAIS International, ProQuest; INRUD Bibliography; WHOLIS, WHO; LILACS), VHL; Global Health Library WHO; PubMed, NHL; SCOPUS; SciELO, BIREME; OpenGrey; JOLIS Library Network; OECD Library; World Bank e-Library; World Health Organization, WHO; World Bank Documents & Reports; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), WHO; ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH. We searched all databases during January and February 2013, apart from SciELO, which we searched in January 2012, and ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov, which we searched in March 2014.

Selection Criteria

We defined policies in this review as laws, rules or financial or administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series studies, repeated measures studies and controlled before-after studies of cap or co-payment policies for a large jurisdiction or system of care. To be included, a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: medicine use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes or costs (expenditures).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. We reanalysed time series data for studies with sufficient data, if appropriate analyses were not reported.

Main Results

We included 32 full-text articles (17 new) reporting evaluations of 39 different interventions (one study - Newhouse 1993 - comprises five papers). We excluded from this update eight controlled before-after studies included in the previous version of this review, because they included only one site in their intervention or control groups. Five papers evaluated caps, and six evaluated a cap with co-insurance and a ceiling. Six evaluated fixed co-payment, two evaluated tiered fixed co-payment, 10 evaluated a ceiling with fixed co-payment and 10 evaluated a ceiling with co-insurance. Only one evaluation was a randomised trial. The certainty of the evidence was found to be generally low to very low.Increasing the amount of money that people pay for medicines may reduce insurers' medicine expenditures and may reduce patients' medicine use. This may include reductions in the use of life-sustaining medicines as well as medicines that are important in treating chronic conditions and medicines for asymptomatic conditions. These types of interventions may lead to small decreases in or uncertain effects on healthcare utilisation. We found no studies that reliably reported the effects of these types of interventions on health outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The diversity of interventions and outcomes addressed across studies and differences in settings, populations and comparisons made it difficult to summarise results across studies. Cap and co-payment polices may reduce the use of medicines and reduce medicine expenditures for health insurers. However, they may also reduce the use of life-sustaining medicines or medicines that are important in treating chronic, including symptomatic, conditions and, consequently, could increase the use of healthcare services. Fixed co-payment with a ceiling and tiered fixed co-payment may be less likely to reduce the use of essential medicines or to increase the use of healthcare services.

### Characteristics and price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States, 2008 to 2018 [^23b0397a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The percentage price change per year from 2008 to 2018 and the associated 95% CI were estimated using a hierarchical linear model with annual year prices in log scale as the dependent variable and calendar year as the independent variable. An autoregressive covariance structure was used to model the multiple drug prices over time per GPI. To analyze the association of drug attributes with a 25% and 50% price increase in any year over the study period, we used a logistic generalized estimating equation model and a compound symmetry covariance structure to account for multiple observations per GPI over time. We used 2 approaches to calculate the odds of a 25% and 50% price increase in each calendar year over the study period for each level of drug attributes: one is the crude odds ratio (OR), and the other is an adjusted OR (aOR) based on the multivariable model controlling for initial price and time association. Missing attribute values were grouped together in a separate level and included in the analysis. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4, statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).

### Immediate impact of minimum unit pricing on alcohol purchases in scotland: controlled interrupted time series analysis for 2015-18 [^752a3685]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Our analysis of KWP household purchase data for 2015-18 found an immediate impact of the introduction of MUP on reductions in total off-trade alcohol purchases in grams of ethanol in Scotland. The largest reductions in consumption were found for beer, spirits, and cider. Given that these categories include the own-brand spirits and high strength white ciders that MUP sought to target, our data suggest that the policy has achieved its ambition to make relatively cheap and strong alcohol less affordable, which in turn should positively impact public health over time.Although the impact of MUP was greater on lower as opposed to higher income households, changes in weekly expenditure were not systematically related to household income but rather increased with increasing household purchases of alcohol. Thus, our data also indicate that MUP was a targeted policy, because it predominantly reduced purchases in the top fifth of alcohol purchasing households.

Comparison with other studies

We found that the introduction of MUP led to a 7.6% reduction in purchases, 2.2 times as much as previous model based work.This change is equivalent to a reduction in purchases of 328 g (41 UK units) per adult per household per year (adjusted for exclusion of on-sales, by dividing by 0.735, the proportion of total alcohol sales by volume of pure alcohol in Scotland that are due to off-trade sales), 1.6 times as much as previous estimates. The only other comparable empirical evidence of the real world impact of MUP on off-trade alcohol purchases used longitudinal data from 20 years of off-trade purchases in two Canadian provinces. These studies found that the introduction of a 10% increase in MUP of any given alcoholic product in British Columbia reduced its per capita alcohol consumption by between 14.6% and 16.1%.A reduction of 8.4% was reported for total volume of pure alcohol sales or purchases in Saskatchewan province (where MUP was implemented across all beverage types) following the same percentage price increase, with larger effect sizes observed in off-trade versus on-trade alcohol sales.Both the Saskatchewan and British Columbia analyses drew on a more extended period of post-intervention data than our study, and relate to a markedly different drinking culture than that found in Scotland, but the direction of effects are consistent with the results presented here.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^386b23a3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular patient out-of-pocket costs and clinician discussions—among Medicare beneficiaries with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, approximately 1 million adults have annual out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2000; implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may expand access to Medicare’s Low-Income Subsidy (starting in 2024), cap out-of-pocket costs at $2000 per person (starting in 2025), and 7 of the first 10 drugs selected for price negotiation are for cardiovascular conditions. We suggest that guideline writing committees consider the inclusion of 1 or more recommendations regarding the need for clinicians to discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients at the time of initiation of a new therapy and at regular intervals thereafter, with the goal of identifying financial strain resulting from out-of-pocket costs and preempting cost-related nonadherence.

### Current and future trends in the consumption, sale and purchasing of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products in great britain, 2014 to 2023 [^1c1dbd5d]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption

We use seven indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption, which are calculated from our four datasets and are, therefore, available for different time periods (see Supporting information, Appendix A1 for dataset, time period and the frequency and number of data points). Indicators using sales and purchasing data may be affected by stockpiling, where consumers buy products and keep them for some time before consumption. We selected these indicators in consultation with the UK Department of Health and Social Care as the current analyses were designed to inform their policy development and monitoring. Our indicators are as follows:
Percentage of total on‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of total off‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of on‐trade outlets offering a no/lo beer on draught: draught beer is dispensed into glass from a tap on the bar, as opposed to sold in a bottle or can, and is, therefore, more visible to the consumer. The denominator for the percentage is the total number of licensed outlets. Increasing the availability of draught no/lo beer is attractive to policy‐makers because it makes these products more visible and normalised. It may also improve perceived value for money by increasing the serving size of no/lo beers and improve perceived quality where consumers prefer draught beer to packaged alternatives.
Percentage of households who do not normally purchase alcohol that are purchasing no/lo products (off‐trade only): calculated in KWP for each week based on whether households in the sample in that week have purchased no/lo and alcoholic drinks in the preceding year. Households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months were excluded from analyses using this measure as they could not be robustly identified as non‐alcohol purchasers in the last year.
Percentage of increasing or higher risk households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products relative to alcohol products (off‐trade only): increasing or higher risk households are those that purchased more than 14 units (1 UK unit = 8 g/10 mL ethanol) of alcohol per adult in the household per week on average over the previous 12 months. For each increasing or higher risk household in KWP each week, we calculated the number of no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the previous 52 weeks. We, then, calculated no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the current week and previous 51 weeks, and identified whether they purchased a greater proportion of no/lo servings compared to standard alcohol servings in this more recent period. We, then, calculated the percentage of households whose no/lo purchasing increased relative to standard alcohol. As above, households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months and 1 week consecutively were excluded from analyses using this measure.
Percentage of households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products and decreasing their purchasing of alcohol products: this is similar to indicators 4 and 5 except indicator 6 includes all alcohol‐purchasing households and, instead of calculating a ratio, identifying households where there was an increase in purchased servings of no/lo drinks and a decrease in servings of standard alcoholic drinks.
Percentage of hazardous or harmful drinkers who are trying to cut down their alcohol consumption that used no/lo products in their most recent attempt: the ATS did not include no/lo products as a method of cutting down in England in five waves (May 2022, July 2022, September 2022, November 2022, December 2022, July 2023), but did include it in Wales and Scotland. We, therefore, used multiple imputations to estimate data for England in these waves (see Supporting information, Appendix Section 3 for details). We calculated a monthly time series for the percentage of respondents per wave who used no/lo in their most recent attempt to cut down. The analysis was not pre‐registered, and therefore, the results should be considered exploratory.

### Equity implications of tobacco taxation: results from WHO FCTC investment cases [^03fdb02e]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
Price of most sold pack of cigarettes without tax, existing tax and 30% increase in price (attributable to new tax).

Table 3 
Cost of most sold brand of cigarettes (US$), cigarette tax and cost with 30% increase in price

The modelled 30% increase in price caused reductions in smoking prevalence among all income groups in all countries, with the largest absolute reductions seen in the countries with the highest overall smoking prevalence, such as Serbia, Vanuatu and Timor-Leste (figure 2). Because of greater responsiveness to changes in price, prevalence declined the most in quintile 1 even when wealthier groups have higher initial smoking prevalence, such as in Egypt. The poorest income quintile experienced the largest decline in smoking prevalence in every country except for Bhutan, where smoking prevalence is over three times greater in quintile 5 than in quintile 1. Bhutan represents an unusual circumstance due to a national ban on the sale of tobacco products in 2010. Bhutanese travelling abroad were allowed to import tobacco products for personal use, providing those with the means to travel abroad with much greater access to tobacco products. Bhutan has since reversed the ban on domestic sales in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic to reduce cross-border contact.

Figure 2 
Absolute reduction in smoking prevalence resulting from 30% increase in price, by income.

The reduced smoking prevalence resulting from a 30% increase in price would prevent over 29 600 deaths among the 19 countries over 1 year. Altogether, 33% of lives saved occurred among the poorest 20% of the population. Bhutan, where only 9% of people who smoke belong to the poorest quintile, is the only country in which quintile 1 received less than 20% of lives saved. In the other 18 countries, the poorest quintile received between 25% (Tunisia) and 50% (Ghana) of lives saved as a result of the increase in price. The price increase also disproportionately benefited the second poorest income group (quintile 2). In every country but Eswatini, quintile 2 received more than 20% of the tobacco-attributable deaths averted.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of reference pricing, other pricing, and purchasing policies [^8a034807]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmaceuticals can be important for people's health. At the same time drugs are major components of health care costs. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Examples are price controls, maximum prices, price negotiations, reference pricing, index pricing and volume-based pricing policies. The essence of reference pricing is to establish a maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs assumed to be therapeutically equivalent.

Objectives

To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases and web sites: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Register (date of last search: 22/08/03), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (15/10/03), MEDLINE (07/09/05), EMBASE (07/09/05), ISI Web of Science (08/09/05), CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts (21/10/03), EconLit (23/10/03), SIGLE (12/11/03), INRUD (21/11/03), PAIS International (23/03/04), International Political Science Abstracts (09/01/04), NHS EED (20/02/04), PubMed (25/02/04), NTIS (03/03/04), IPA (22/04/04), OECD Publications & Documents (30/08/05), SourceOECD (30/08/05), World Bank Documents & Reports (30/08/05), World Bank e-Library (04/05/05), JOLIS (22/08/05), Global Jolis (22/08/05 and 23/08/05), WHOLIS (29/08/05).

Selection Criteria

Policies in this review were defined as laws, rules, financial and administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes, and costs (expenditures); the study must be a randomised controlled trial, non-randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, repeated measures study or controlled before-after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. Quantitative analysis of time series data, for studies with sufficient data, and qualitative analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

We included 10 studies of reference pricing and one study of index pricing. Most of the reference pricing studies were for senior citizens in British Columbia, Canada. The use (dispensing) of reference drugs increased in five studies, between 60% and 196% immediately after introduction of reference drug pricing, whereas the use of cost sharing drugs decreased by between 19% and 42% in four studies. In three studies the reference drug group expenditures decreased (range 19% - 50%), whereas in the fourth study the expenditures increased by 5% in the short term. The results after six months of reference pricing do not show any clear pattern in relationship to the immediate effects. We found no evidence of adverse effects on health and no clear evidence of increased health care utilisation. For index pricing the evidence was much more limited than for reference drug pricing. A small reduction in drug prices was found.

Authors' Conclusions

We found relatively few studies of pricing policies. The majority of the studies dealt with reference pricing. They had few methodological limitations. Based on the evidence in this review, mostly from senior citizens in British Columbia, Canada, reference drug pricing can reduce third party drug expenditures by inducing a shift in drug use towards less expensive drugs. We found no evidence of adverse effects on health and no clear evidence of increased health care utilisation. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patient drug expenditures were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported.

### A rapid review examining purchasing changes resulting from fiscal measures targeted at high sugar foods and sugar-sweetened drinks [^90ba4ff3]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Laboratory/virtual experiments

There were eight studies conducted in a laboratory (n = 5, 1 of which was controlled) – or virtual, that is, web-based shopping setting (n = 3, 2 RCTs, 1 controlled no randomisation) –. Seven of these studies were carried out in adult only populations,,– and one study was carried out in children aged 12 to 14 years. Seven studies demonstrated that an increase in prices of SSDs or groups of 'unhealthy' or 'energy dense' foods and products (including those with ‘high sugar’ content) resulted in a decrease in purchases –, with one study showing no effect.

An RCT by Waterlander, was conducted using a virtual supermarket in the Netherlands and focused on purchases of SSDs. Following an increase in Value Added Tax on SSDs from 6 to 19% (a mean change of 12.4%) results showed a statistically significant decrease in the purchase of SSDs of 0.9 litre per household per week in the intervention group vs. control. This study was relatively small (n = 102) but of high quality. A French study by Darmon(n = 33) employed a combined 'subsidy' of 30% on 'healthy' foods and a 30% 'tax' on 'unhealthy' foods (defined by measures of nutritional quality: calories per 100 g, percentage of free sugars, percentage of recommended intakes for several key nutrients or Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR)). There were no ‘tax only’ condition outcome data and the effect on sugar intake was not reported, however a reduction in purchases of ‘unhealthy’ foods due to was reported. This was the only study to examine the different impacts of the intervention in low and medium income groups. While the intervention resulted in an improved nutritional quality of foods purchased overall in both income groups, the extent of the improvement was greater in the middle income group than the low income group suggesting that price manipulations would not necessarily tackle income driven inequalities in nutritional quality of food purchases.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^aeb815d1]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The case for collaboration

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly important for medicines that are only available from a single source (a monopoly). Price negotiations can deliver mixed results where negotiations are based on discounts from a “list price” ceiling set by the seller, rather than a negotiating floor that reflects the cost of production.

No single strategy or policy can lead to a fair price for medicines. Each policy has its benefits and drawbacks, and thus it is important that it is not used in isolation. For buyers a robust strategy would make use of elements of each policy and be adapted to country characteristics.

In the absence of transparent data, buyers need to maximise their market power (monopsony power) to rival the monopoly they are confronting, otherwise an imbalance in market forces can lead to market failure. By imposing some of the strategies outlined above, payers have asserted their buying power and come closer to achieving a fair price.

Buyers seeking fairer prices benefit from both transparency and collaboration, but this requires strong commitment from decision makers. International commitment is emerging, with a recent World Health Assembly resolution on improving the transparency of markets.Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders.

Key messages

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly acute for single source medicines—that is, medicines lacking an alternative with a similar indication (monopoly)
Price negotiations deliver mixed results, particularly when anchored by discounts from a “list price” ceiling set by the seller, with no transparency about the true costs of development and production that could anchor a negotiating floor
In the absence of transparent data, the closest that buyers can get to fairer pricing is to impose regulations and policies that attempt to assert their buying power
Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders

### Lowering drug prices and enhancing pharmaceutical affordability: an analysis of the national volume-based procurement (NVBP) effect in China [^ad888ee7]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

To cope with the increasing healthcare costs brought about by the universal health insurance programme, national volume-based procurement (NVBP) was implemented in China to reduce drug prices. However, the impact of NVBP remains unknown. We reported the effects of the NVBP pilot programme on medication affordability and discussed the challenges and recommendations for further reforms. A total of 25 molecules won the bidding in the NVBP pilot programme, and price cuts ranged from 25% to 96%. Medication affordability was measured as the number of days' wages needed to pay for a course of treatment, and the medication was identified as affordable if the cost of a treatment course was less than the average daily wage. After the NVBP, the proportion of affordable drugs increased from 33% to 67%, and the mean affordability improved from 8.2 days' wages to 2.8 days' wages. Specifically, for rural residents, the proportion of affordable drugs increased from 13% to 58%, and the mean affordability improved from 15.7 days' wages to 5.3 days' wages. For urban residents, the proportion of affordable drugs increased from 54% to 71%, and the mean affordability improved from 5.9 days' wages to 2.0 days' wages. Implementing the NVBP substantially improved medication affordability. In future reforms, a multifaceted approach addressing all issues in the health system is needed to enhance medicine access.

### COVID-19 vaccines pricing policy options for low-income and middle-income countries [^f58a7866]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Drivers of high prices

As of January 2021, nearly 200 vaccines were in development, several candidates have received emergency use authorisation and vaccinations have started. However, by most estimates, demand will continue to outstrip supply for the foreseeable future.Manufacturing capacity is a rate-limiting factor and current models predict there will not be enough vaccine doses to cover the world’s population until 2023 or 2024.The limited supply means this is a supplier’s market for the foreseeable future. Most low-income countries are excluded from the competition for doses because of their low purchasing power. Approximately 7.1 billion doses have already been purchased with high-income countries purchasing most doses. Countries like Canada and the UK have purchased approximately five doses per capita.Middle-income countries such as Brazil, India and Peru have leveraged their manufacturing or clinical testing capacity in negotiating purchase agreements. India is also developing several vaccine candidates and authorised its first COVID-19 vaccine, for emergency use.Some low-income countries have signed advanced purchase agreements, but none is expected to have enough to cover their population. To date, roughly 49 higher income countries have administered more than 39 million vaccine doses compared with only 25 doses in one lowest income country.A model by Northeastern University forecasted a 61% reduction in global COVID-19 mortality if the first 3 billion doses of vaccines are distributed proportionally by national population. This compares with only a 33% reduction if the first 2 billion doses are co-opted by high-income countries with the remaining 1 billion doses distributed equally globally.

The purchase agreements are secret but the limited information available points to variation in prices and high price signals.The USA is estimated to be paying $19.50 and the European Union $18.90 per dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.The US purchase price varies from $4 per dose for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to $37 per dose of the Moderna vaccine.Israel’s willingness to pay a higher price, reportedly $30 per dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, has been cited along with its agreement to serve as a global pilot for vaccine rollout, as one reason for its rapid scale up of its vaccination programme.The secrecy of the agreements limits the negotiating power of low-income and middle-income countries with already limited purchasing power.

### The effect of rising food prices on food consumption: systematic review with meta-regression [^89eccc07]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Differences between household income groups

We repeated our meta-regression models for the subset of 21 studies (with 355 estimates) that reported relations between food prices and demand for different income groups within the same countries and compared the highest income group with the lowest reported in each study. The 21 included studies were more likely than those in our country level analysis to report data from high income countries and to have used data from supermarket scanner surveys, from which price elasticity estimates are generally larger, because of the higher level of disaggregation of this type of data.

Our analysis identified that demand for food was more responsive to price changes among households with lower incomes (table 3). The highest elasticities were found for meat (−0.95, 95% confidence interval −1.07 to −0.82), fish (−1.01, −1.17 to −0.84), and other food (−1.06, −1.21 to −0.92) among low income households, and the lowest were found for cereals (−0.72, −0.85 to −0.59), sweets (−0.73, −0.91 to −0.55), and fruit and vegetables (−0.73, −0.84 to −0.62) among high income households. The differences in elasticities between income groups were largest in high income countries, but were also substantial in low income countries (data shown in supplementary table S3).

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of reference pricing, other pricing, and purchasing policies [^ba2804ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmaceuticals are important interventions that could improve people's health. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used as cost-containment measures to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Internal reference pricing establishes a benchmark or reference price within a country which is the maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs. Other policies include price controls, maximum prices, index pricing, price negotiations and volume-based pricing.

Objectives

To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, drug expenditures and drug use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (including the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Register) (searched 22/10/2012); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and MEDLINE, Ovid (searched 22/10/2012); EconLit, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); PAIS International, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); World Wide Political Science Abstracts, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); INRUD Bibliography (searched 22/10/2012); Embase, Ovid (searched 14/12/2010); NHSEED, part of The Cochrane Library (searched 08/12/2010); LILACS, VHL (searched 14/12/2010); International Political Science Abstracts (IPSA), Ebsco (searched (17/12/2010); OpenSIGLE (searched 21/12/10); WHOLIS, WHO (searched 17/12/2010); World Bank (Documents and Reports) (searched 21/12/2010); Jolis (searched 09/10/2011); Global Jolis (searched 09/10/2011) ; OECD (searched 30/08/2005); OECD iLibrary (searched 30/08/2005); World Bank eLibrary (searched 21/12/2010); WHO - The Essential Drugs and Medicines web site (browsed 21/12/2010).

Selection Criteria

Policies in this review were defined as laws; rules; financial and administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation and health outcomes or costs (expenditures); the study had to be a randomised trial, non-randomised trial, interrupted time series (ITS), repeated measures (RM) study or a controlled before-after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Results were summarised in tables. There were too few comparisons with similar outcomes across studies to allow for meta-analysis or meaningful exploration of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (seven identified in the update): 17 of reference pricing, one of which also assessed maximum prices, and one of index pricing. None of the studies were trials. All included studies used ITS or RM analyses. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. Three reference pricing studies reported cumulative drug expenditures at one year after the transition period. Two studies reported the median relative insurer's cumulative expenditures, on both reference drugs and cost share drugs, of -18%, ranging from -36% to 3%. The third study reported relative insurer's cumulative expenditures on total market of -1.5%. Four reference pricing studies reported median relative insurer's expenditures on both reference drugs and cost share drugs of -10%, ranging from -53% to 4% at one year after the transition period. Four reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of 15% in reference drugs prescriptions at one year (range -14% to 166%). Three reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of -39% in cost share drugs prescriptions at one year (range -87% to -17%). One study of index pricing reported a relative change of 55% (95% CI 11% to 98%) in the use of generic drugs and -43% relative change (95% CI -67% to -18%) in brand drugs at six months after the transition period. The same study reported a price change of -5.3% and -1.1% for generic and brand drugs respectively six months after the start of the policy. One study of maximum prices reported a relative change in monthly sales volume of all statins of 21% (95% CI 19% to 24%) after one year of the introduction of this policy. Four studies reported effects on mortality and healthcare utilisation, however they were excluded because of study design limitations.

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of the studies of pricing and purchasing policies that met our inclusion criteria evaluated reference pricing. We found that internal reference pricing may reduce expenditures in the short term by shifting drug use from cost share drugs to reference drugs. Reference pricing may reduce related expenditures with effects on reference drugs but the effect on expenditures of cost share drugs is uncertain. Reference pricing may increase the use of reference drugs and may reduce the use of cost share drugs. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patients' drug expenditures were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported. Reference pricing effects on health are uncertain due to lack of evidence. The effects of other purchasing and pricing policies are until now uncertain due to sparse evidence. However, index pricing may reduce the use of brand drugs, increase the use of generic drugs, and may also slightly reduce the price of the generic drug when compared with no intervention.

### Characteristics and price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States, 2008 to 2018 [^0d78be03]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to date to comprehensively analyze the drug attributes and prevalence of price increases affecting sole-source, off-patent, and off-exclusivity drugs in the United States. We found that price increases of at least 25% and 50% within a given year were common, and prices increased on average by 8.8% per year. Drugs with an initial price of less than $2 per unit, antineoplastic and immunomodulatory class, oral administration route, and FDA approval before 1990 were more likely to sustain price increases of 25% and 50% within a given year. Our findings confirm that price hikes affecting this drug market are not one-off events,, but rather are common occurrences. Furthermore, average prices increased by 8.8% per year after inflation, which equates to a doubling of the real price in less than a decade. These data are consistent with prior studies, showing that limited manufacturer competition in off-patent drug markets is associated with substantial price increases.

A key finding from the present study is that drugs with low initial prices (<$2 per unit) were more likely to increase by 25% and 50% or more in a given year. Manufacturers may be more likely to target lower-priced drugs for price hikes because they are less likely to capture headlines and the attention of lawmakers. In addition, there may be more opportunity to raise prices up to consumers’ willingness to pay for essential medications for drugs at lower absolute price levels. Similarly, older drugs were also more likely to increase by 25% and 50% in a calendar year. This finding gives weight to the argument that drug manufacturers may preferentially target older drugs, such as pyrimethamine (approved in 1953) and epinephrine auto-injector (approved in 1987), for steep price increases.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines—the writing committee “recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines,” with the threshold to be “periodically reexamined,” “not be adjusted annually for inflation,” and “revised every 10 years (or sooner …).” Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that “suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY,” a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income (“per capita disposable income of $60 300 … approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY”), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating “$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY,” translating to “$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY” after GDP growth; while “no single method … can be considered the ‘gold standard,’” these three approaches “produced similar results.”

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^9b3533e3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation #4—Don’t Use Expensive Medications When an Equally Effective and Lower-Cost Medication Is Available highlights that, on average, the cost of a generic drug is 80%—85% lower than the brand name product while having the same active ingredients, strength, and similar effectiveness. Physicians’ cost accuracy is low, with less than 50% of estimates accurate by any definition of cost accuracy, and patient preference for generics is limited, with only 37.6% preferring generics for their own health. Increasing generic utilization can yield large savings; for every 10% increase in the use of generic cholesterol drugs, Medicare costs could be reduced by $1 billion annually. Adherence data from more than 90,000 Medicare beneficiaries showed higher adherence to generic statins compared with brand name statins and a lower composite outcome of hospitalization and death.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^a30bffc9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Although many of the associations at the aggregate level are replicated across income groups, the effect of increasing the price of SSBs on purchases of other beverages shows some variance by income group, particularly for the high-income versus the low- and medium-income groups. In the high-income group, increases in the price of high-sugar SSBs decreases the purchase of cider (0·5% for 1% price increase), while in the middle-income group it reduces the purchases of spirits (0.2% for 1% price increase) but no decrease is evident in alcohol purchases in the low-income group. For medium-income groups there is also an increase in lager purchase if the price of high-sugar SSB increases. For an increase in the price of medium-sugar drinks, a common pattern is seen of complementary purchases, predominantly with juice and lager, across all income groups; although of different magnitudes.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^5990124f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology—out-of-pocket costs and policy context—reports that more than 20% of insured adults and more than 60% of uninsured adults have delayed or foregone health care due to rising medical costs, and among Medicare beneficiaries with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, approximately 1 million adults have annual out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2000. Implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may help by expanding access to Medicare’s Low-Income Subsidy (starting in 2024), capping out-of-pocket costs at $2000 per person (starting in 2025) and allowing costs to be spread over the year rather than requiring a single lump payment; additionally, 7 of the first 10 drugs selected for price negotiation are for the treatment of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors. While these reforms will lower cost-sharing for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and costs to Medicare, they are unlikely to benefit patients with other forms of insurance. We suggest that guideline writing committees consider the inclusion of 1 or more recommendations regarding the need for clinicians to discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients at the time of initiation of a new therapy and at regular intervals thereafter, with the goal of identifying financial strain resulting from out-of-pocket costs and preempting cost-related nonadherence.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

Intervention costs—given pricing complexity, high-quality economic evaluations “should incorporate an estimate of net price to the payer after discounts or rebates in their base-case analysis,” ideally reflecting “the net price to the payer or payers for the entire or majority of the treatment-eligible population being evaluated, rather than a specific subpopulation.”

### Employer-sponsored health insurance premium cost growth and its association with earnings inequality among US families [^62babd5e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our analysis also has some limitations. First, our study design cannot determine causality, and employers may not redirect all savings associated with slower premium growth toward increased employee pay. For example, employers may instead invest in capital, new business ventures, or an expanded workforce. Nonetheless, premium growth represents an opportunity loss for higher wages within the budgeted costs for employee compensation, and prior research has documented associations between health care premium increases and depressed wages.,,, Second, increasing premiums could be offset by reductions in other employer-sponsored benefits, such as vacation time or retirement fund contributions; however, data limitations prevented us from exploring these associations. Historical trends support potential decreasing employer contributions to retirement funds and unchanged amounts of paid time off as a percentage of employee compensation over large portions of the study period. Thus, our findings may underestimate the true economic costs to families of increasing ESI premiums if greater premium costs not only cut into wages but also degrade the generosity of other benefits because employers have a finite amount of money to contribute to combined employee pay and benefits. Whether premium growth has also exacerbated racial and ethnic wealth gaps in retirement savings is an area for future research. Third, these findings are applicable to US families with ESI family plans with fixed premium costs for all earnings levels and are not generalizable to US families with non-ESI plans nor to uninsured families. Fourth, some employees may be willing to receive lower wages if costlier premiums buy higher-quality health care, such as coverage of new medications and treatments. Although health care spending increased faster in the US than in other high-income countries during our 32-year study period, the US continues to have the highest maternal and infant mortality, the lowest life expectancy at birth, and the highest death rates for avoidable or treatable conditions among high-income countries, suggesting that increased health care spending does not guarantee better population-level health outcomes.Fifth, we did not incorporate state income tax rates in our net premium cost calculations. However, state income taxes are typically small compared with federal payroll taxes (the mean state income tax in 2022 was only 2.1%),and a handful of states do not levy income taxes; thus, their inclusion would likely have little effect on our findings. Sixth, our analysis does not account for increasing personal deductibles and other out-of-pocket medical expenses; thus, our findings likely underestimate the full negative association of increasing health care costs with economic disparities by race and ethnicity and wage level.

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^5c5a1786]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study examines the emotional consequences of spending choices in everyday life across a diverse multinational sample. Based on a dataset of 200 participants across 7 countries who received $10,000 USD, we analyzed how happy they felt from different types of purchases made with that money. Participants derived high levels of happiness from some types of purchases that have been examined in past research (e.g., buying experiences), but also from other purchases (e.g., education) that have not been the focus of previous work. We found some evidence that the emotional benefits of spending choices varied depending on whether participants lived in higher vs. lower-income countries; specifically, we found differences in the benefits of spending on gifts, housing, debt, and time-saving services. Around the world, people who spent money in ways that made them happy experienced greater improvements in overall subjective well-being 3 and 6 months later.

### Characteristics of state legislation addressing prescription drug price increases in the United States, 2020 [^1e9db801]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

After excluding 5 laws due to narrow scope, 15 laws (11 states) addressing price increases met inclusion criteria. These laws all fit within three categories (defined in Fig. 1): 10 transparency, 4 affordability review, and 1 anti-price gouging law in Maryland, later judged unconstitutional.After excluding 23 bills due to narrow scope (i.e. insulin; costliest/most commonly prescribed 10–25 drugs), 69 price increase bills were characterized. Most bills also fit within three categories: transparency (32/69; 46%), affordability review (18/69; 26%), or anti-price gouging (16/69; 23%). Aggregate characteristics of these categories are summarized in Table 1.

Figure 1

Aggregate Characteristics of State Price Increase Bills Considered (Not Enacted) in 2020

a Objective thresholds include a price threshold (e.g. a drug with a wholesale acquisition cost [WAC] of at least $40 for a 30-day course), a price increase threshold (e.g. a drug whose price increases 40% over 3 years), or both (e.g. a drug with a WAC of at least $100 for a 30-day course, whose price is increased by 20% over any 3-year period)

b Subjective thresholds, such as “unconscionable” price increases, do not specify prices or price increases and are open to interpretation by the specified entity (affordability board, judiciary, etc.)

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of cap and co-payment on rational drug use [^7fb725b4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Growing expenditures on prescription drugs represent a major challenge to many health systems. Cap and co-payment (direct cost-share) policies are intended as an incentive to deter unnecessary or marginal utilisation, and to reduce third-party payer expenditures by shifting parts of the financial burden from the insurer to patients, thus increasing their financial responsibility for prescription drugs. Direct patient drug payment policies include caps (maximum number of prescriptions or drugs that are reimbursed), fixed co-payments (patients pay a fixed amount per prescription or drug), coinsurance (patients pay a percent of the price), ceilings (patients pay the full price or part of the cost up to a ceiling, after which drugs are free or available at reduced cost), and tier co-payments (differential co-payments usually assigned to generic and brand drugs).

Objectives

To determine the effects of cap and co-payment (cost-sharing) policies on drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases and web sites: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Register (date of last search: 6 September 07), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (27 August 07), MEDLINE (29 August 07), EMBASE (29 August 07), NHS EED (27 August 07), ISI Web of Science (09 January 07), CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts (21 October 03), EconLit (23 October 03), SIGLE (12 November 03), INRUD (21 November 03), PAIS International (23 March 04), International Political Science Abstracts (09 January 04), PubMed (25 February 04), NTIS (03 March 04), IPA (22 April 04), OECD Publications & Documents (30 August 05), SourceOECD (30 August 05), World Bank Documents & Reports (30 August 05), World Bank e-Library (04 May 05), JOLIS (22 February 06), Global Jolis (22 February 06), WHOLIS(22 February 06), WHO web site browsed (25 August 05).

Selection Criteria

We defined policies in this review as laws, rules, or financial or administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series analyses, repeated measures studies and controlled before-after studies of cap or co-payment policies for a large jurisdiction or system of care. To be included, a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes or costs (expenditures).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. We undertook quantitative analysis of time series data for studies with sufficient data.

Main Results

We included 30 evaluations (in 21 studies). Of these, 11 evaluated fixed co-payment, six evaluated coinsurance with a ceiling, four evaluated caps, three evaluated fixed co-payment with a ceiling, three evaluated tier co-payment, one evaluated ceiling, one evaluated fixed co-payment and coinsurance with a ceiling, and one evaluated a fixed co-payment with a cap. Most of the included evaluations were observational studies and the quality of the evidence was found to be generally low to moderate. Introducing or increasing direct co-payments reduced drug use and saved plan drug expenditures across studies. Patients responded through drug discontinuation or by cost-sharing. Investigators found reductions for life-sustaining drugs or drugs that are important in treating chronic conditions as well as other drugs. Few studies reported on the effects on health and healthcare utilisation. One study found adverse effects on health through increased healthcare utilisation when a cap was introduced in a vulnerable population. No statistically significant change in use of healthcare services was found in other studies when a cap was introduced on a drug considered over-prescribed in a vulnerable population, or following a shift from a two-tier to a three-tier system with increased co-payments for tier-1 drugs in a general population.

Authors' Conclusions

We found a diversity of cap and co-payment policies. Poor reporting of the intensity of interventions and differences in setting, populations and interventions made it difficult to make comparisons across studies. Cap and co-payment polices can reduce drug use and save plan drug expenditures. However, although insufficient data on health outcomes were available, substantial reductions in the use of life-sustaining drugs or drugs that are important in treating chronic conditions may have adverse effects on health, and as a result increase the use of healthcare services and overall expenditures. Direct payments are less likely to cause harm if only non-essential drugs are included or exemptions are built in to ensure that patients receive needed medical care.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2. Reference case for high-quality CEAs—costs and outcomes—states that costs should be based in the same jurisdiction as the target population, and health care cost estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Micro-costing can produce reliable cost estimates but is not always feasible; when micro-costing is not available or feasible, gross-costing is an acceptable alternative. Cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entity or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Costs of medical devices should be the price net of discounts when available or the list price when the net price is not available, and a wide range of costs should be examined in sensitivity analyses. Cost estimates should be adjusted for nonadherence, and the currency and year of evaluation should be clearly identified. For health outcomes, the reference case should report outcomes in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, report alternative metrics when available, report intermediate outcomes, and may include disutility related to taking the treatment in sensitivity analyses.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^750f7056]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Intervention costs

Country specific resource needs and costs were derived using the WHO-CHOICE database,which includes detailed component specific estimates of inputs (ingredients) required for each intervention stage for each country’s government and the estimated unit price for each input in that country including for example costs of human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment, and mass media (see supplementary eMethods). To facilitate comparisons between countries, we converted all costs to international dollars (I$) (see supplementary eMethods), which account for each nation’s currency as well as purchasing power parity.One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower incomes than the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved would be much lower). We summed costs by year to calculate the total cost of the 10 year intervention for each country, with 3% annual discounting.

We modeled only governmental intervention costs, for several reasons. First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately. Second, net industry sector costs for product reformulation in each country would be difficult to determine because once the relevant reformulation has been undertaken in any single country, the knowledge of that reformulation can be extended with much less additional cost to other countries. For example, multinational companies transfer improved recipes and reformulation strategies across borders with no cost, as do food scientists moving between firms, and so on. Third, in contrast to recent US models,we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survivaland because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally. Because including such cost savings would be optimal according to many cost effectiveness guidelines, our results for overall cost effectiveness should be considered a conservative estimate.

### Analysis of article 6 (tax and price measures to reduce the demand for tobacco products) of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control [^65693334]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

The relationship between excise taxes and the retail price (ie, the tax burden) and trends in the retail price are two dimensions of the effectiveness of tax policy. Changes in tobacco taxes are only effective as a tobacco control tool if they raise the retail price of cigarettes so that cigarettes become less affordable over time.Tobacco products become less affordable if the price of cigarettes increases by a greater percentage than the sum of the inflation rate and the growth in per capita income, over time. Figure 1 shows changes in cigarette affordability between 2008 and 2016 for the 168 parties that had comparable data over this period, where cigarette affordability is measured as the percentage of per capita GDP required to purchase 100 packs of 20 cigarettes.

Figure 1 
Cigarette affordability trends, 2008–2016 (n=168). Source: estimates constructed from information contained in the individual country profiles compiled by WHO 2017. This figure only shows information for those countries that had ratified the FCTC by November 2016. FCTC, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

Of the 168 parties, cigarettes became less affordable in 46% (78/168), remained constant in 41% (69/168), but became more affordable in 13% (21/168) of parties. Eleven of the 21 parties in which cigarettes became more affordable over the 2008–2016 period are from the African region.

Although cigarette affordability has decreased, or remained the same, in most parties since 2008 (figure 1), many parties do not have a policy of consistently reducing the affordability of cigarettes over time. We find that, of the 72 parties for which cigarettes had become less affordable between 2012 and 2014, cigarettes became more affordable in 33 of those parties (46%) between 2014 and 2016. This illustrates the need for automatic adjustments in taxes to account for changes in inflation and income growth.

As at 2016, only 15 parties automatically adjust their specific excise tax to account for inflation. For example, in 2012 the Philippines introduced its ‘Sin Tax’ reform, which substantially simplified and increased the excise tax between 2013 and 2017, and provided for an automatic annual 4% increase in cigarette taxes after 2018.In December 2013, Australia implemented the first of four preannounced annual 12.5% tobacco excise tax increases, in addition to biannual inflation adjustments.In 2016, the Australian government announced a further four rounds of 12.5% annual increases in tobacco excise, which began in July 2017.

### Cigarette prices in a complex cigarette tax system: empirical evidence from Indonesia [^2fbcec59]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The complex cigarette tax system in Indonesia has created the opportunity for cigarette producers to avoid tax, which results in affordable cigarette prices. In addition to increasing cigarette tax every year, the government has adopted several policies to increase cigarette prices, such as reducing the number of tiers and applying cigarette tax based on the combined production of affiliated companies (ie, firms with a minimum 10% ownership of another cigarette company, sharing the same boards of commissioners or using input from other tobacco companies, in which a firm has at least 10% ownership).

Objective

To investigate the effect of cigarette tax, affiliated company rules and changes in the number of tiers on cigarette prices produced in Indonesia.

Method

Using brand level data from 2005 to 2017, we model cigarette prices as a function of cigarette tax, affiliated company rules, number of tiers, cigarette types and cigarette tax system using random effect and fixed effect estimations.

Finding

We find that a percentage increase in cigarette tax increases cigarette prices by less than 1% for all cigarette types. The implementation of affiliated company rules is effective in increasing cigarette prices for both affiliated and non-affiliated firms. We also find that a fewer number of tiers are associated with a higher cigarette price. Our results suggest that a reduction in the number of tiers will increase the effectiveness of a specific tax system in making cigarettes less affordable.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d62ef0fa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected—1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020—and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention’s life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are “cost-effective” without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### Association between the percentage of US drug sales subject to inflation penalties and the extent of drug price increases [^b3b8c486]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Policy makers have proposed levying penalties for drug price increases that are higher than the rate of inflation for drugs covered in the US Medicare program, but research is lacking regarding the ways in which manufacturers might respond to those penalties. An understanding of manufacturers' responses to existing inflation penalties could inform such policy discussions.

Objective

To estimate the association of existing inflation penalties in the US 340B Drug Pricing Program with manufacturer pricing behavior in the Medicare Part D program and associated changes in Medicare pharmacy expenditures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study included a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis of price changes for Medicare Part D drugs used annually by more than 5000 beneficiaries between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017. The percentage of Medicare Part D sales subject to inflation penalties in the 340B program was used to perform a regression analysis to estimate the association of inflation penalties with annual drug price changes. The 340B program requires manufacturers to sell their drugs at a lower price to safety-net health care organizations; this lower price includes a base discount and an additional discount equal to the amount of any price increase that is higher than the rate of inflation. Sales to these 340B-eligible health care organizations represent the market share of a drug subject to inflation penalties. Health care organization-level claims data were obtained from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data-Part D Prescriber database, and organizations were matched to the Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System of the Health Resources and Services Administration to identify those organizations that were eligible for the 340B program. Price change and drug use data were obtained from the Medicare Part D Drug Spending Dashboard. Name-brand drugs were included in the analysis if they did not have generic competition and were used by more than 5000 individuals with Medicare Part D in 1 calendar year. Data analysis was conducted from January 1 to February 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measure

Annual price change was the primary outcome measure; spending changes associated with lower price increases were also estimated. Sales percentage subject to inflation penalties was the primary independent variable, and formulary classification was a control variable.

Results

Of 2148 brand-name drugs included in the database, 606 drugs were used by more than 5000 beneficiaries annually, with a mean sales percentage subject to inflation penalties of 12.1%. A higher sales percentage subject to inflation penalties was associated with lower annual price increases (between-effects coefficient, -0.114; 95% CI, -0.205 to -0.023; P=.01; fixed-effects coefficient, -0.380; 95% CI, -0.466 to -0.294; P<.001). Lower price increases owing to inflation penalties were estimated to be associated with a reduction in Medicare Part D pharmacy expenditures of $7.1 billion between 2013 and 2017.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, increases in the percentage of drug sales subject to inflation penalties were associated with lower annual price increases. Broader application of inflation penalties may help to reduce drug price increases and decrease overall drug spending.

### Economic burden of locoregional and metastatic relapses in resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer in Spain [^53a2bce0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Unit costs

Direct health costs were calculated by multiplying the natural units of the resources used described in the previous section by the corresponding unit cost. All the unit costs were obtained from national databases and are expressed in euros of 2022.

Pharmacological costs were expressed as the ex-factory price considering (when appropriate) the corresponding deductions according to Royal Decree Law 08/2010.

Healthcare unit costs were obtained from the Spanish healthcare database and are summarized in Additional file 8.

Indirect costs

Indirect costs measured by productivity losses due to sick leave were calculated using the human-capital approach, considering that the salary reflects the worker’s productivity. It was estimated that 25% of patients were under 65 years old at the time of relapse and therefore of working age. Among the working-age population, the average annual salary for the 45–65 years old age range was obtained from the National Salary Structure Survey and adjusted by the unemployment rate of 9.47% for that age range (INE).

The panel of experts agreed that due to relapses, 33% of patients who suffer a locoregional relapse return to work after an average sick leave of 7, 6 months, with the remaining 66% taking indefinite leave. All patients with metastatic relapses take indefinite sick leave and never return to work.

Sensitivity analysis

Uncertainties were explored through a multi-way sensitivity analysis which also provided a range to the mean values reported as base case. In the multi-way sensitivity analysis, the following model parameters were modified by a 20% increase or decrease from the baseline value: number of treatment cycles, location of the metastasis, percentage of patients using a healthcare resource, frequencies of healthcare resources, healthcare unit costs, patients of working age and average annual salary.

### The impact of user fees on access to health services in low-and middle-income countries [^ec96ef61]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Following an international push for financing reforms, many low- and middle-income countries introduced user fees to raise additional revenue for health systems. User fees are charges levied at the point of use and are supposed to help reduce 'frivolous' consumption of health services, increase quality of services available and, as a result, increase utilisation of services.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of introducing, removing or changing user fees to improve access to care in low-and middle-income countries

Search Strategy

We searched 25 international databases, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. We also searched the websites and online resources of international agencies, organisations and universities to ﬁnd relevant grey literature. We conducted the original searches between November 2005 and April 2006 and the updated search in CENTRAL (DVD-ROM 2011, Issue 1); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid (January 25, 2011); MEDLINE, Ovid (1948 to January Week 2 2011); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2011 Week 03) and EconLit, CSA Illumina (1969 - present) on the 26th of January 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, interrupted time-series studies and controlled before-and-after studies that reported an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: healthcare utilisation, health expenditures, or health outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We re-analysed studies with longitudinal data. We computed price elasticities of demand for health services in controlled before-and-after studies as a standardised measure. Due to the diversity of contexts and outcome measures, we did not perform meta-analysis. Instead, we undertook a narrative summary of evidence.

Main Results

We included 16 studies out of the 243 identified. Most of the included studies showed methodological weaknesses that hamper the strength and reliability of their findings. When fees were introduced or increased, we found the use of health services decreased significantly in most studies. Two studies found increases in health service use when quality improvements were introduced at the same time as user fees. However, these studies have a high risk of bias. We found no evidence of effects on health outcomes or health expenditure.

Authors' Conclusions

The review suggests that reducing or removing user fees increases the utilisation of certain healthcare services. However, emerging evidence suggests that such a change may have unintended consequences on utilisation of preventive services and service quality. The review also found that introducing or increasing fees can have a negative impact on health services utilisation, although some evidence suggests that when implemented with quality improvements these interventions could be beneficial. Most of the included studies suffered from important methodological weaknesses. More rigorous research is needed to inform debates on the desirability and effects of user fees.

### The Lancet Nigeria commission: investing in health and the future of the nation [^257dfc92]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Recommendation 3

The federal government should lead efforts to improve health financing (ie, revenue mobilisation, pooling and management of funds, and purchase of services), aligning the investment case with political incentives, levers of accountability, and the rhetorical appeal of “health for wealth” among the Nigerian population. To achieve these improvements the government should:

• Establish legally ring-fenced predetermined health budgets outside of the electoral cycle, which occurs every 4 years to ensure sustainable funding and strategic planning building on the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, and using the third National Strategic Health Development Plan to reach the goal of 15% of the annual budget allocated to health
• Establish structural reforms to withdraw inequitable subsidies towards financing health and social services building on lessons from the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (eg, 1·5 trillion Naira in petroleum subsidy can free up fiscal space to be redirected towards health)
• Fund health insurance coverage to all Nigerians by paying the estimated 15 000 Naira per capita annual premium for 83 million least wealthy individuals (approximately 40% of the population) with revenue raised through the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund, taxation, and levies, and each state to fund residents through their state health insurance scheme supported by a national mechanism to assure quality; today, it would cost 1·2 trillion Naira or 9% of the current budget to cover individuals who cannot afford to pay current premiums in National and State Health Insurance Schemes
• Improve the efficiency of systems for pooling and purchasing of health finances by establishing national and state purchasing organisations with oversight for allocation of funds, raised through revenues generated from taxation, levies, or donors, and the payer at each level should use strategic health purchasing to provide more health services using available resources
• Increase the national fiscal space for health through more efficient tax collection (company profit tax, and capital gains) and through innovative health financing such as levies on commercial services (eg, mobile phone use, financial transactions, and air travel) to reach the existing goal of reducing the proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure to below 30% by the end of NSHDP III and improve health outcomes
• The federal government should anticipate donor transition and prepare for post-aid status in which technical assistance, knowledge, and learning are more relevant than donor projects, which will require domesticating financing of health, research, and development, to achieve health independence and decolonise the Nigerian health space. Local institutions must be prepared to step up.

### Collective international action to increase access to costly drugs: pooled procurement and equity based tiered pricing [^0d64c1ff]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fragmented markets and siloed procurement processes diminish the negotiating power of less populous or lower income countries, leading to delayed or limited access to costly treatments. Confidential pricing agreements could further exacerbate inequities, as wealthier countries often secure better discounts, leaving smaller markets to pay disproportionately higher prices relative to their income. These dynamics highlight the need for alternative procurement and pricing models designed to tackle systemic imbalances.

### Characteristics and price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States, 2008 to 2018 [^b91e6e71]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

We identified important outlier drugs with high initial prices that had extraordinary percentage price increases (>100%) and absolute changes in price. For example, edetate calcium disodium, used to treat lead poisoning, increased by 1512% from $18.08 per unit in 2012 to $291.45 per unit in 2013. Samarium SM-153 lexidronam pentasodium (Quadramet), indicated for the treatment of pain in patients with osteoblastic metastatic bone lesions, increased by 392.7% from $2603.25 per unit in 2016 to $12 825.06 per unit in 2017. Both drugs treat rare diseases, which we identified as being a common characteristic among drugs with large percentage price increases in our sample. A prior studyfound that price hikes were more prevalent among less frequently prescribed generic drugs.

Drugs used to treat rare diseases typically attract few generic competitors because of limited sales volume,which we suspect is a key factor explaining the lack of generic competition among sole-source, off-patent drugs and the corresponding price increases. Other potential barriers to generic entry in this market include companies having difficulty demonstrating bioequivalence for complex drugs and tactics by current manufacturers to limit access to necessary drug samples, as occurred with pyrimethamine.

We found that price increases of at least 25% were more likely to occur among dermatologic drugs, a class known for price increases affecting off-patent drugs.Drugs in the antineoplastic and immunomodulatory class were more likely to sustain price hikes of at least 25% and 50%. This finding is noteworthy considering that all of the price increases among cancer drugs affected old drugs that have been on the market for at least the last 3 decades.

### Collective international action to increase access to costly drugs: pooled procurement and equity based tiered pricing [^22f62b71]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Bargaining power

In recent decades, the European Union and individual countries have introduced policies to encourage the drug industry to invest in areas of high unmet medical need and public health priorities. However, these policies have not overcome persistent challenges in securing affordable access to costly drugs. Even wealthier European countries see delayed access to effective drugs that were developed with the support of public financing. The problem is particularly acute for lower income and smaller countries, and access remains highly unequal between countries.

Inequities are driven by differences in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending, drug pricing, and rates of use.A key contributor to these inequities is that drug pricing and reimbursement is nearly always set nationally. This limits the ability of smaller and lower income countries to negotiate effectively with drug companies, which prioritise larger, wealthier markets. As a result, these countries may face higher prices, delayed launches, or complete exclusion from access to innovative treatments. Fragmented markets and political tensions also hinder joint procurement efforts that could improve bargaining power and reduce inequities across countries.

Potential solutions should be affordable, simple, and transparent, and cost-containment must address system-wide burdens that can reduce access. The AAN supports proposals that give federal agencies the authority to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered Part D drugs, stating that price negotiation would allow the federal government to leverage purchasing power to obtain prescription drugs at a lower price and bring savings to the healthcare system and consumers. The AAN supports the ability for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, such as provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (section 11001), and would support other proposals that foster competition and promote access to more affordable medications.

### The effect of rising food prices on food consumption: systematic review with meta-regression [^4c10ba00]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Differences between food groups and country income levels

Predicted price elasticities from the meta-regression models identify clear and robust trends by country income level: demand for all food groups was more responsive to changes in price in lower income than higher income countries (table 2). The highest predicted price elasticities (represented by the largest negative coefficients) were found for meat (−0.78, 95% confidence interval −0.83 to −0.73), fish (−0.80, −0.85 to −0.74), dairy (−0.78, −0.84 to −0.73), and other food (−0.95, −1.01 to −0.90) in low income countries, whereas the lowest were found for cereals (−0.43, −0.48 to −0.36) and fats and oils (−0.42, −0.48 to −0.35) in high income countries. The low predicted price elasticity for eggs was based on a relatively small number of observations (see table 1). Sensitivity analysis including only high quality studies (n=40) did not substantially alter these findings.

### Changes in price, income and e-cigarette affordability for young people in the USA from 2015 to 2021 [^084da136]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

E-cigarette products are the most popular tobacco/nicotine product used among youth and young adults in the USA. While emerging research has shown that e-cigarette taxes increase their price, no study to date has examined e-cigarette tax burdens nor their affordability for youth and young adults.

Methods

Using real (2021 US dollars) prices per mL of e-liquid data from NielsenIQ and annual real (2021 US dollars) personal income data from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, we calculate relative income prices and examine average annual percentage changes in affordability using Joinpoint trend analysis from 2015 to 2021. In addition, we use tax data to calculate e-cigarette tax burdens as a percentage of price per 1mL of e-liquid.

Results

In all states analysed, tax burdens increased from 2015 to 2021. E-cigarette prices decreased considerably from 2019 to 2021; in 2021 the real (2021 US dollars) average price of 1mL of e-liquid was US$4.45. E-cigarettes on average became more affordable for all age groups and states; however, e-cigarettes tended to be less affordable in states with ad-valorem tax structures. On average, 16-17-year-olds needed 31% of their annual income to purchase 100 mL of e-liquid, whereas 18-19-year-olds, 20-24-year-olds and 25-34-year-olds needed 9%, 3% and 1%, respectively.

Conclusions

E-cigarettes have become more affordable for young people, but less so in states with ad-valorem tax structures. Policy efforts should focus on reducing e-cigarette affordability, especially for youth, through tax-induced increases in e-cigarette prices to levels high enough to outpace income growth.

### Policy framework for covering preventive services without cost sharing: saving lives and saving money? [^cd689aca]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The US Affordable Care Act mandates that private insurers cover a list of preventive services without cost sharing. The list is determined by 4 expert committees that evaluate the overall health effect of preventive services. We analyzed the process by which the expert committees develop their recommendations. Each committee uses different criteria to evaluate preventive services and none of the committees consider cost systematically. We propose that the existing committees adopt consistent evidence review methodologies and expand the scope of preventive services reviewed and that a separate advisory committee be established to integrate economic considerations into the final selection of free preventive services. The comprehensive framework and associated criteria are intended to help policy makers in the future develop a more evidence-based, consistent, and ethically sound approach.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^c0c00fbf]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The use and consequences of limited economic evaluation of new medicines

A somewhat speculative argument can be made that the widespread application of standard CEA has an economic effect and a subtle political effect with potentially large unintended adverse consequences. First, it may be that R&D spending on the development of new medicines is distorted by suppressed incentives due to certain payors not considering the full societal benefits of medicines. Essentially, because some developed countries are using CEA as a bargaining tool to secure lower prices that are actually below what their citizens would be able and willing to pay, they are both free riders on the global R&D investment and possibly causing some innovation to go unfunded. The political effect is that these underestimations of value based on conventional CEA and lower prices outside the USA have been used to argue that Americans are paying more than they should truly be willing to pay. As a result, we would argue, the new US Inflation Reduction Act has been passed as a toe in the price-control water, with an inadequate understanding of what full immersion will imply.

Countries that rely on central planning and traditional CEA as their justification for capping the prices may be using it as an excuse to pay less. What can be harmful about these countries using traditional CEA to justify their unwillingness to pay anywhere close to US prices (or else to limit their patients’ access, thereby cutting the revenues they contribute) is that these analyses may give the US public, policymakers, physicians, and payers the impression that medicines are not worth what the US is paying for them. Traditional CEA can thus give the impression that the US market-based system is broken and in need of a regulatory fix, namely price controls. But when viewed in terms of aggregate impact, a good case can be made that the US’s patent-based, market-based competitive framework is working reasonably well, despite an imperfect national insurance system, to bring about affordable biomedical innovation that benefits not only US citizens, but everyone worldwide. Should US policymakers impose price controls on novel medicines in a misguided effort to spare US payers from overpaying, they would be undermining innovation that would be cost-effective for the US and beneficial globally.

### Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review [^23d0d9ba]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Economic evaluations

Where budgets are constrained there is an unavoidable opportunity cost of undertaking any policy, as funds spent on one intervention will limit the funds available for other interventions. The aim of economic evaluation is to assist policy makers to identify interventions/policies which represent good value for money. The value for money associated with a new intervention is determined by comparing the additional costs required and additional outcomes achieved, with the status quo or current intervention. Where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at lower costs, it is said to ‘dominate’ the current intervention/policy and a decision about adopting the new intervention/policy is straightforward. However, where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at greater cost, a decision must be made about whether to spend these additional resources to achieve these additional outcomes. Where outcomes of different interventions/policies are valued using common metrics (see table 1), the value for money associated with them can be directly compared to indicate where these outcomes can be achieved at the lowest price. These interventions represent the best value for money compared with the alternatives available and, where resources are scarce, could be considered ‘economically worthwhile’.

### Evolving methodology of national tobacco control investment cases [^6dc011d2]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying the best available data

Data sources for key parameters are listed in table 1. Ideally, data must be credible, nationally representative and recent. For each WHO FCTC investment case, we sought context-specific data to reflect the epidemiological and economic conditions in the country and fill a standardised list of model parameters. These included gross domestic product (GDP), labour force size and employment rates, average salary or wages, average hours worked per day, month and year, excess absenteeism due to smoking, excess presenteeism due to smoking, unsanctioned smoking breaks, healthcare expenditures, the smoking-attributable fraction (SAF) of healthcare expenditures, prevalence of current cigarette smoking, population, life expectancy and death rates.

We worked with government stakeholders to collect, calibrate, and adjust national and locally available data, where available and preferred. To do so, we submitted data collection forms to national health authorities seeking their knowledge of available sources for relevant parameters and often held virtual meetings to follow up and connect with key academic or government authorities.

Some data points were readily available from most—though not all—national governments (eg, employment rates, GDP, healthcare expenditures, population, tobacco use prevalence). Other data were only sometimes forthcoming (eg, average annual salary/wages, annual quit attempt rates among current smokers, price and/or income elasticity of demand measures for tobacco products, rates of use of evidence-based forms of treatment such as nicotine replacement therapy, behavioural therapy), or not or rarely locally available (eg, tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality, tobacco-related healthcare expenditures and value of a statistical life year (VSLY)).

In cases where no context-specific data were nationally available, with country agreement, we defaulted to use of country-specific data from global models or databases, or regional or income group-specific averages in published online sources.

### Associations between cigarette prices and consumption in Europe 2004-2014 [^b75f11b5]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increases in tobacco price are known to reduce smoking prevalence, but these correlations may be blunted by the availability of budget cigarettes, promoted by the tobacco industry to maintain profits.

Objective

To investigate the effect of budget cigarettes on cigarette consumption using data from Europe 2004-2014.

Methods

Data on the annual population-weighted cigarette consumption per adult come from the International Cigarette Consumption Database. Data on the annual tobacco price come from Euromonitor International for 23 European countries. Median prices and price differentials (operationalised as percentages obtained by dividing the difference between median and minimum prices by the median price) were examined. A linear random-effects model was used to assess associations between median prices and price differentials with cigarette consumption within 1 year and with a 1-year time lag.

Results

Cigarette consumption per capita declined over the study period (-29.5 cigarettes per capita per year, 95% confidence interval -46.8 to -12.1). The analysis suggests that increases in cigarette price differentials, a marker of opportunities for smokers to switch to less expensive cigarettes, may be associated with greater consumption in the same year (6.4 for a 10% increase in differential, -40.0 to 52.6) and are associated with greater consumption in the following year (67.6, 25.8 to 109.5).

Conclusion

These analyses suggest that even in Europe, where tobacco taxes are relatively high compared with other regions, differential cigarette pricing strategies may undermine tobacco control. Further research is needed on links between tobacco price structures and consumption, and policy design to maximise the effectiveness of tobacco taxation.

### Collective international action to increase access to costly drugs: pooled procurement and equity based tiered pricing [^ff753524]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the context of costly drugs and higher income European countries, tiered pricing could be piloted with a suitable candidate product—ideally a durable or curative therapy expected to be offered at a high price and with low resale risk. A benchmark price reflecting the drug’s relative value—ideally judged by the joint clinical assessment according to EU HTA regulations—would need to be negotiated and agreed with the manufacturer. The manufacturer would be incentivised to agree to a base price lower than the maximum level achievable to entice higher income countries to participate in collective negotiations, saving manufacturers from having to negotiate with each participating country individually. Income related price differentials would need to be agreed based on specified national income tiers, with payers and the manufacturer committing to price transparency. Mechanisms to inhibit export of the product outside the intended market could be implemented through transparent rebates, rather than upfront discounts, and stringent policy monitoring. Including a larger group of countries may increase the likelihood of achieving policy objectives but may pose challenges for agreeing solutions, as highlighted by a feasibility study for equity based tiered pricing in EU member states.

Finally, implementation of tiered pricing requires transparency in pricing and transparency in the research and development costs of drugs. The former is required to establish relative prices between countries; the latter would help in assessing the adequacy of prices for cost recoupment and profit generation, especially related to public incentives and co-funding of new drugs by the public sector. Both types of transparency might help to develop the trust needed for fruitful partnerships and promote accountable management of public resources, potentially in pilots facilitated by WHO Europe with the input of multiple stakeholders.

In addition, devaluation of the Yemeni riyal have led to inflated food prices since 2015.Due to the exhaustion of foreign trade reserves, Yemeni local currency is tremendously inflated, and 19% of its value has been lost against the U.S. dollar within the first half of 2020, outperforming the levels noted in the 2018 crisis.This has led to soaring prices, yet a diminished purchasing power of Yemeni citizens.For more than 1 year, more than 1.2 million Yemeni government employees have not received their salaries.High levels of inflation directly correlates to reduced purchasing power, which is pushing more Yemenis into poverty according to a 2020 report.In areas of Yemen operated by the internationally recognized government where Yemeni currency continues to devalue, the normal cost of the smallest food basket increased by 7% in August 2021.Indeed, before the pandemic, almost 80% of Yemenis were dependent on humanitarian help.However, the UN has announced a reduction in food aid to Yemen due to lack of funds.Starting in January 2022, the World Food Program (WFP) has detailed that 8 million Yemenis will be given “barely half” of the agency’s daily minimum allocation.The agency detailed that it needs more than a billion dollars in 2022 to deliver food assistance to starving families in Yemen.Another important factor contributing to rising food prices is constant flooding. In October 2008, April 2020, and again in July 2021, floods continuously damaged private and public property, as well as food stocks.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of regulating drug insurance schemes [^9da646bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug insurance schemes are systems that provide access to medicines on a prepaid basis and could potentially improve access to essential medicines and reduce out-of-pocket payments for vulnerable populations.

Objectives

To assess the effects on drug use, drug expenditure, healthcare utilisation and healthcare outcomes of alternative policies for regulating drug insurance schemes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and two trials registers between November 2014 and September 2020, including a citation search for included studies on 15 September 2021 using Web of Science. We screened reference lists of all the relevant reports that we retrieved and reports from the Background section. Authors of relevant papers, relevant organisations, and discussion lists were contacted to identify additional studies, including unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time-series studies (including controlled ITS [CITS] and repeated measures [RM] studies), and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. Two review authors independently assessed the search results and reference lists of relevant reports, retrieved the full text of potentially relevant references and independently applied the inclusion criteria to those studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion, and when necessary by including a third review author. We excluded studies of the following pharmaceutical policies covered in other Cochrane Reviews: those that determined how decisions were made about which conditions or drugs were covered; those that placed restrictions on reimbursement for drugs that were covered; and those that regulated out-of-pocket payments for drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias for each study, with disagreements being resolved by consensus. We used the criteria suggested by  Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC)  to assess the risk of bias of included studies. For randomised trials, non-randomised trials and controlled before-after studies, we planned to report relative effects. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) when possible and adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measures. For interrupted time series and controlled interrupted time-series studies, we computed changes along two dimensions: change in level; and change in slope. We undertook a structured synthesis following the EPOC guidance on this topic, describing the range of effects found in the studies for each category of outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 58 studies that met the inclusion criteria (25 interrupted time-series studies and 33 controlled before-after studies). Most of the studies (54) assessed a single policy implemented in the United States (US) healthcare system: Medicare Part D. The other four assessed other drug insurance schemes from Canada and the US, but only one of them provided analysable data for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis. The introduction of drug insurance schemes may increase prescription drug use (low-certainty evidence). On the other hand, Medicare Part D may decrease drug expenditure measured as both out-of-pocket spending and total drug spending (low-certainty evidence). Regarding healthcare utilisation, drug insurance policies (such as Medicare Part D) may lead to a small increase in visits to the emergency department. However, it is uncertain whether this type of policy increases or decreases hospital admissions or outpatient visits by beneficiaries of the scheme because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Likewise, it is uncertain if the policy increases or reduces health outcomes such as mortality because the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors' Conclusions

The introduction of drug insurance schemes such as Medicare Part D in the US health system may increase prescription drug use and may decrease out-of-pocket payments by the beneficiaries of the scheme and total drug expenditures. It may also lead to a small increase in visits to the emergency department by the beneficiaries of the policy. Its effects on other healthcare utilisation outcomes and on health outcomes are uncertain because of the very low certainty of the evidence. The applicability of this evidence to settings outside US healthcare is limited.

### Collective international action to increase access to costly drugs: pooled procurement and equity based tiered pricing [^0c3ff38a]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Current approaches to pricing and their limitations

Current national frameworks for drug pricing promote inequitable access to costly drugs, particularly in lower income countries. External reference pricing is a widely used practice in which a country determines drug prices based on prices in other jurisdictions. Although this method aims to reduce drug costs by referencing lower prices elsewhere, it can increase inequity when wealthier countries benchmark against poorer ones. For example, wealthier nations such as Belgium and Austria have referenced poorer countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to set medicine prices, despite the GDP per capita of these reference countries being a third or less of that in the wealthier countries.This practice may discourage drug companies from launching their drugs with lower prices in lower income countries to maintain drug prices in higher income countries.A restricted price range for a drug can ultimately limit access, because drug prices in higher income countries are not affordable for lower income countries.

Additionally, drug companies may avoid launching products in lower income countries to protect their pricing strategies in wealthier, more lucrative markets, denying timely access to life saving treatments in lower income settings.External reference pricing can contribute to short term cost containment, but this effect is highly dependent on system design and implementation.An investigation into pharmaceutical list prices in European countries concluded that external reference pricing has only a minor association with drug prices because companies can raise the minimum price to avoid lowering prices altogether; instead companies use compensatory strategies such as confidential discounts and delayed launches.

Another approach, price discrimination, where manufacturers adjust drug prices based on what each market can bear, achieves more affordable prices in lower income countries while still generating profits that incentivise investment in innovation. However, it does not ensure equitable or affordable pricing. For example, research shows that lower income countries sometimes pay more for drugs for cancer treatment when adjusted for purchasing power parity, highlighting the inequitable impacts of such pricing strategies.Higher income countries often secure better discounts through confidential agreements (often in the form of rebates) owing to their larger market potential; however, even these prices may remain unaffordable or strain the sustainability of health systems. Additionally, limited transparency about real prices can prevent key stakeholders, including prescribers and patients, from making value based decisions.

### Modelling the expected impact of cigarette tax and price increases under Vietnam's excise tax law 2015-2020 [^72e2eac5]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

where (IE) is the income elasticity and (IC) is per capita income growth using real GDP per capita as a proxy.The different elasticities are designed to reflect the impact of increased incomes on smokers choice with respect to perceived quality rather than quantity or in other words ‘trading-up’ to higher priced brands. It also stylistically reflects a common industry strategy of ‘premiumisation’ in countries like China, for example, where prices seldom increase but marketing and promotion aims to encourage smokers to trade-up.

Overall, the modelling approach combines the two price and income elasticity effects to estimate annual cigarette consumption from 2017 to 2020.

Given cigarette prices and consumption, the final component to be modelled is the rate of smoking among adults since GATS in 2015. In this respect, the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes reflects a mix of conditional demand (the intensity of smoking) and the number of smokers (ie, participation). The empirical evidence shows that about half of the reduction in cigarette consumption due to a price increase is due to a decrease in conditional demand (intensity), while the other half is due to a reduction in prevalence (ie, people quitting).Hence, the price prevalence elasticity of demand accounts for about half the decrease in cigarette consumption.For example, a price elasticity of −0.5 for cigarettes in middle-income countries would include a price prevalence elasticity of around −0.25.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives—Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, “Modified Societal,” Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a “modified” societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Characteristics and price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States, 2008 to 2018 [^01d611f5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Some sole-source, off-patent drugs in the United States have undergone substantial price hikes in recent years. Despite increased attention by lawmakers, there are limited data to guide policy.

Objectives

To describe key attributes of sole-source, off-patent, off-exclusivity drugs; to characterize the prevalence of price increases; and to identify attributes associated with price increases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, 300 sole-source, off-patent, off-exclusivity drug products met inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018. Attributes were identified from multiple sources, and yearly wholesale acquisition cost prices were determined from First Databank.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association of drug attributes with the following 2 price change thresholds was measured after adjusting for inflation: 25% or more price increase in a calendar year (wholesale acquisition cost) and 50% or more price increase in a calendar year. The rate of annual price increase over time was also measured.

Results

Of the 300 drug products and 2242 observations analyzed, the overall inflation-adjusted mean increase in drug prices was 8.8% (95% CI, 7.8%-9.8%) per year. Ninety-five drugs (31.7%) increased by 25% or more during any calendar year, and 66 drugs (22.0%) increased by 50% or more during any calendar year. An initial price of less than $2 per unit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.69-3.29), antineoplastic and immunomodulatory class (aOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.31-5.65), dermatologic class (aOR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.80-4.84), oral route (aOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.45-2.79), and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before 1990 (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14-2.03) were attributes of drugs that were more likely to be associated with a 25% or more price increase in a calendar year after adjusting for by initial price. Similarly, an initial price of less than $2 per unit (aOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.76-4.09), antineoplastic and immunomodulatory class (aOR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.54-6.12), oral route of administration (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11-2.60), and FDA approval before 1990 (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.40-2.94) were attributes of drugs that were more likely to be associated with a 50% or more price increase in a calendar year after adjusting for by initial price. Price increases of 25% or more were most common in 2014, and price increases of 50% or more were most common in 2013.

Conclusions and Relevance

Price increases among sole-source, off-patent drugs are common, and policy interest in this practice is warranted. These findings should inform state drug pricing legislation.

### Economic determinants of diet in older adults: systematic review [^ecdd0382]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Main findings

Studies documented a pattern of mixed impact on food spending and consumption as a function of change in the economic context (table 2). Studies examining a shift from employment to retirement found spending decreased (7% to 11%) for certain groups (eg, co-habiting, involuntary retired) or settings (eg, eating out), but spending also stayed constant for single-person households, the voluntarily retired and home consumption.Reported effects came from three good quality studies of sufficient follow-up to permit accurate assessment of lasting effects on spending. The intervention study, in which fruit and vegetable prices were reduced by nearly 50%, reported decreased spending of low-income seniors at their most recent supermarket visit, with the greatest impact among seniors using the programme weekly. However, the study could not account for substitution in produce spending between supermarket and intervention site.

Six studies examined dietary outcomes and all reported an increase in at least some aspect of food intake as a function of employment transition to retirement (table 2). Two studies revealed slight increases in daily fibre intake in British men and women, particularly when breakfast was consumed,or in consumption of pastry, potato chips and related food items by Swedish women.The food price intervention study found more low-income seniors in New York consumed vegetables and fruits 3 months after retirement.Finally, two studies documented an increased prevalence of healthy food habits in Finnish women who were retired compared to the employed,and an increased weekly intake of fish and vegetables and daily glasses of juice and alcohol in Dutch men.

Some studies showed no impact on food consumption. For example, the main British foods contributing to increased fibre intake and the proportion of older people below recommendations stayed constant.Post-retirement improvements in women's healthy food habits were not seen in retired Finnish men compared to employed men.A small French study also found the distribution of nutrients appeared unchanged after retirement.Although this study was assessed as being of low quality, findings corroborate similar results of no impact from other good quality studies.

Finally, two studies reported decreases in food intake. A study of female Swedish municipal employees showed a decreasing tendency in average number of daily meals and in nearly all nutrients.Another study of rural Dutch men also documented reductions in consumption of meat and potatoes and milk, depending on level of occupational activity.

### Carbon pricing and planetary boundaries [^fc55327c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The direct effect of imposing this increase in the tax rate on fossil fuel use is clearly to increase its (after tax) price leading to a reduction in its demand. Our analysis shows that a one percentage point increase in the global carbon tax rate would reduce annual global CO 2 emissions by 0.25% (equivalent to 0.11 GtCO 2 yr −1), and emissions from fossil fuels by 0.36% (see Supplementary Table 2). The implied elasticity of emission reductions is smaller than in some model-based analyses but is relatively well-aligned with empirical estimates (see Supplementary Note 2).

This reduction in emissions ameliorates pressure on both climate change and ocean acidification (depicted as arrows at the top and bottom of Fig. 2, pointing inward toward the safe operating space). This change does not come from a single sector, but rather is the net effect of changes in fossil fuel use in the production of energy services, fertilizer, land use change, etc. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use decrease in most sectors as a result of the tax, while emissions from land use change increase due to substitution toward land in agriculture and increased biofuel production. Similar direct impacts occur with aerosol loading. The net effect is a reduction in aerosol loading (measured in terms of aerosol optical depth) following a reduction in the release of atmospheric particles from fossil-fuel burning.

### Longitudinal study of the effects of price and promotion incentives on purchases of unhealthy foods: evidence for restricting food promotions [^81f6a620]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Table 3 
Estimated percentage change in calories (kcal) purchased due to incentives across the household purchasing distribution

Between product categories, table 3 indicates that the scale of the purchasing response to incentives varies significantly. The own-price elasticity of demand is highest for crisps, where a 10% reduction in the price per gram is predicted to increase the mean calories (kcal) purchased by 8.8%. Although mean demand is inelastic (percentage change in demand is less than the percentage change in price) for all product categories, savoury snacks (6.4%) and biscuits (4.3%) are less responsive to price changes than crisps. A χ 2 test strongly rejects the null hypothesis that at the mean all product categories are equally responsive to price changes (p=2.14e−213). Equivalent null hypotheses are also rejected for the effects of price promotions (p=5.02e−207) and volume promotions (p=2.26e−83). However, the pattern of responsiveness between products varies. Whereas crisps is the product category most responsive to price, it is the least responsive category for both price promotions and volume promotions. Biscuits is the most responsive category to price promotions (37.0%), and savoury snacks is the most responsive category to volume promotions (77.8%).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Device cost inputs in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—methodological guidance emphasizes transparency, pricing sources, sensitivity analyses, and handling price opacity. High-quality CEAs should be transparent about the source of effectiveness and safety parameters (and, if substantial changes have occurred over time, the version of the device that these inputs refer to), and they should also evaluate how sensitive their conclusions are to uncertainty in these parameters. Because device prices can vary widely across health systems, CEAs should use the price net of discounts where available or the list prices when the net price is not available, and device costs should be varied widely in 1-way sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect on the ICER. In situations where device costs are truly opaque, the economic value statement should report the threshold prices at which the device would be expected to be cost-effective. The costs of drugs or devices can also change substantially over time, baseline risk may change over time, and collectively these changes can markedly alter the economic value of an intervention.

Table 2. 
Multivariable Difference-in-Differences Regression Results Comparing Trends in Drug Selection, Patient Cost Sharing, and Mean Prices Paid for the Reta Trust and the California Public Employees Retirement System

This pattern changed after implementation of reference pricing. In the first 2.5 years after implementation, the percentage of prescriptions made for the low-priced drug within each therapeutic class increased by 5.1 percentage points (95% CI, 1.8 to 8.4 percentage points), patient cost sharing increased by 10.3% (95% CI, −1.6% to −23.6%; this difference was not statistically significant), and prices paid decreased by 19.1% (95% CI, −30.2% to −6.2%) for Reta Trust patients compared with CalPERS patients. During the subsequent 2-year postimplementation period, the percentage of prescriptions made for the low-priced drug increased an additional 6.2 percentage points (95% CI, 2.3 to 10.1 percentage points), patient cost sharing decreased by 21.3% (95% CI, −31.2% to −9.9%), and prices paid increased by a 7.2% (95% CI, −12.6% to 31.4%; this difference was not statistically significant). By the end of the study period, the percentage of prescriptions made for the low-priced drug was higher, whereas patient cost sharing and mean prices paid were lower than before implementation of reference pricing.

### Global return on investment and cost-effectiveness of WHO's HEAR interventions for hearing loss: a modelling study [^e918c338]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Treatments for hearing loss confer no survival benefit, so DALYs averted are calculated on the basis of quality of life (disutility) alone. Discounted DALYs averted are calculated for each individual undergoing treatment. DALYs averted are calculated based on the effect of treatment on severity (change in disability level), and duration for which the treatment is effective (7 years). For all treatments initiated, DALY benefits were counted in full regardless of what year treatment was initiated—ie, benefit was not truncated if treatment was initiated near the end of the model time horizon. However, the duration of treatment effect also took into account mortality, using a life-table approach to avoid over-estimating DALYs for individuals who would die before 7 years. No further DALY benefit is accounted for in individuals who die in the 7 years following a hearing loss intervention. A full illustration of DALY calculations is given in the appendix (p 62).

Direct costs

All costs and benefits are discounted at 3% in the base case in line with the WHO CHOICE approach.All costs are presented in 2018 US$. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity was inflated from the most recently available year to 2018 using the World Bank GDP deflator. The year of most recent GDP data along with details about labour market data is given in the appendix (pp 34–45).

The global unit costs (2018 US$) for interventions included in the analysis are calculated using a bottom-up or ingredients-based approach in line with previous WHO analyses.Unit costs are outlined in table 1, based on detailed commodity costs; useful life of devices and utilisation are further outlined in the appendix (pp 4–6). Staff costs are not included in global unit costs, as individual costs are available for each of the 172 countries modelled. Staff salaries per minute by level were extracted for each country from the WHO CHOICE database to estimate staff costs for each intervention (appendix pp 27–33). Low and high estimates for use in the sensitivity analysis are included.

Total cost per intervention is calculated for each intervention using the proportion of the target group receiving the intervention (coverage), unit cost of equipment, and the type, number, and duration of consultations by staff type. Full details are enumerated in the appendix (pp 7–25).

Return on investment was defined as the ratio of the discounted net benefit to costs (total monetised benefits minus total costs, divided by total costs).

Societal perspective in economic evaluation—costs for medical interventions or programs are counted regardless of payer to avoid mere cost shifting, so all costs should be included irrespective of who pays. This principle emphasizes that redistributing costs across patients, providers, payers, or others does not save money and supports using a societal perspective when assessing value.

### Paying for performance to improve the delivery of health interventions in low-and middle-income countries [^66643442]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a growing interest in paying for performance as a means to align the incentives of health workers and health providers with public health goals. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, paying for performance is a complex intervention with uncertain benefits and potential harms. A review of evidence on effectiveness is therefore timely, especially as this is an area of growing interest for funders and governments.

Objectives

To assess the current evidence for the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.

Search Methods

We searched more than 15 databases in 2009, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (searched 3 March 2009), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 1) (searched 3 March 2009), MEDLINE, Ovid (1948 to present) (searched 24 June 2011), EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2009 Week 09) (searched 2 March 2009), EconLit, Ovid (1969 to February 2009) (searched 5 March 2009), as well as the Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (1975 to present) (searched 8 September 2010). We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature and contacted experts in the field. We carried out an updated search on the Results-Based Financing website in April 2011, and re-ran the MEDLINE search in June 2011.

Selection Criteria

Pay for performance refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target. To be included, a study had to report at least one of the following outcomes: changes in targeted measures of provider performance, such as the delivery or utilisation of healthcare services, or patient outcomes, unintended effects and/or changes in resource use. Studies also needed to use one of the following study designs: randomised trial, non-randomised trial, controlled before-after study or interrupted time series study, and had to have been conducted in low- or middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank).

Data Collection and Analysis

We aimed to present a meta-analysis of results. However, due to the limited number of studies in each category, the diversity of intervention designs and study methods, as well as important contextual differences, we present a narrative synthesis with separate results from each study.

Main Results

Nine studies were included in the review: one randomised trial, six controlled before-after studies and two interrupted time series studies (or studies which could be re-analysed as such). The interventions were varied: one used target payments linked to quality of care (in the Philippines). Two used target payments linked to coverage indicators (in Tanzania and Zambia). Three used conditional cash transfers, modified by quality measurements (in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo). Two used conditional cash transfers without quality measures (in Rwanda and Vietnam). One used a mix of conditional cash transfers and target payments (China). Targeted services also varied. Most of the interventions used a wide range of targets covering inpatient, outpatient and preventive care, including a strong emphasis on services for women and children. However, one focused specifically on tuberculosis (the main outcome measure was cases detected); one on hospital revenues; and one on improved treatment of common illnesses in under-sixes. Participants were in most cases in a mix of public and faith-based facilities (dispensaries, health posts, health centres and hospitals), though districts were also involved and in one case payments were made direct to individual private practitioners.One study was considered to have low risk of bias and one a moderate risk of bias. The other seven studies had a high risk of bias. Only one study included any patient health indicators. Of the four outcome measures, two showed significant improvement for the intervention group (wasting and self reported health by parents of the under-fives), while two showed no significant difference (being C-reactive protein (CRP)-negative and not anaemic). The two more robust studies both found mixed results - gains for some indicators but no improvement for others. Almost all dimensions of potential impact remain under-studied, including intended and unintended impact on health outcomes, equity, organisational change, user payments and satisfaction, resource use and staff satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence base is too weak to draw general conclusions; more robust and also comprehensive studies are needed. Performance-based funding is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches. Its effects depend on the interaction of several variables, including the design of the intervention (e.g. who receives payments, the magnitude of the incentives, the targets and how they are measured), the amount of additional funding, other ancillary components such as technical support, and contextual factors, including the organisational context in which it is implemented.

### Taxation of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages: reviewing the evidence and dispelling the myths [^6979a4b9]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Price responsiveness of demand

Studies have measured the own-price elasticities of tobacco and have centred around values of −0.4 (ie, a 10% increase in prices implies a 4% decrease in quantity consumed) for high-income countries and around −0.5 for low- and middle-income countries, although the difference may not be statistically significant.About half of the own-price elasticity is due to a decrease in prevalence (ie, due to people quitting smoking), while the other half is due to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked by those who continue smoking.Youths are substantially more price-responsive than adults in countries at all income levels,and young men are more price-responsive than young women.In addition, higher prices delayed or prevented smoking initiation in various countries (ie, the own-price elasticity of smoking onset is negative and statistically significant).Finally, higher tobacco prices increase the likelihood of cessation in both high- and middle-income countries.

The evidence on own-price elasticity for alcohol is also compelling, with values around −0.5.However, not all types of alcoholic beverages are equal, as beer demand is less price-responsive than wine and spirits (-0.3 vs −0.6, respectively).There is little evidence of gender differences in price responsiveness.Studies show different results on own-price elasticities by age, finding no conclusive differences between youths and adults.Even binge drinkers are price-responsivebut tend to choose cheaper drinks to keep up their alcohol consumption. This implies that policies aiming at increasing the price of more affordable drinks (eg, minimum unit price policies) can effectively reduce binge and/or heavy drinking.Finally, evidence on how prices affect alcohol initiation is scarce but suggests that higher prices delay and, to some extent, prevent initiation. This can have long-lasting effects on future drinking patterns; for example, individuals who initiate at older ages have a lower probability of having frequent heavy-drinking episodes.

The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) reports on costs of medications and may consider other components of resource utilization; it searches national databases, such as the National Health Expenditure Data of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, considers annualized wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) for each eligible pharmacologic treatment, and, if national data are unavailable, searches for published, peer‑reviewed economic analyses. The CGC considers resource utilization data to understand economic burden, range, and trends in national spending over time.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^36dee5b1]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, increasing the price of SSBs has the potential to both decrease and increase the purchase of alcohol across all income groups. An increase in the price of high-sugar drinks may cause a significant increase in purchase of lager for the middle-income group and decrease in cider for the high-income group. An increase in the price of medium-sugar drinks tends to reduce purchase of beer, and lager across all income groups, generating a ‘healthy multiplier’ effect for the price increase. An increase in the price of diet/low-sugar drinks, however, generates increased purchase of all categories of alcohol with the exception of spirits. On balance, a policy to increase the price of SSB needs to consider the sugar-content level at which a price increase would be imposed to have most effect. Conversely, any policy that increases the price of diet/low-sugar drinks could produce substitution patterns to alcoholic drinks that is likely to be undesirable. This is important for proposed industry levies, such as that proposed for the UK, as industry is free to determine how to recoup the levy from consumers with an option to increase the price of all drinks, including diet drinks. If so, this could reduce the beneficial effects from a rise in the price of medium-sugar drinks and add negative effects from diet drink price increases through the increased purchase of alcohol. Although not definitive, the relationships found in this analysis are sufficiently robust to suggest that policies – and research – concerning the price of SSBs need to consider the effects beyond the SSBs targeted and support the need for further primary research on the behaviour patterns associated with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage choices.

### Physician and patient adjustment to reference pricing for drugs [^960eb5e9]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Reference pricing has been shown to reduce drug spending in Europe and has been adopted by some employers and labor unions in the United States. Its association with patient cost sharing depends on whether and how quickly physicians adjust their prescribing patterns to favor the least costly alternatives within each therapeutic class.

Objective

To examine whether the implementation of reference pricing is associated with physicians and patients shifting to lower-cost drugs, thereby reducing consumer cost sharing and the prices paid by employers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation included employees of Catholic organizations who purchased health insurance through the Reta Trust and a random sample of employees of public sector organizations who purchased insurance through the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) as a comparison group between July 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2019, to September 1, 2019.

Exposures

The Reta Trust implemented reference pricing in July 2013; CalPERS did not adopt reference pricing during the study period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Probability that the drug prescribed was the least costly alternative within its therapeutic class, price paid per prescription, and patient cost sharing per prescription. Multivariable, difference-in-differences regression analysis of drug insurance claims was performed for patients before and after implementation of reference pricing, adjusted for patient characteristics, each drug's therapeutic class, and the month and year of the prescription.

Results

During the study period, a total of 1.2 million prescriptions were submitted by 34 319 individuals covered by Reta Trust and 2.1 million prescriptions were submitted by 738 159 individuals covered by CalPERS. In the first 2.5 years after implementation of reference pricing, the percentage of prescriptions made for the low-priced drug within each therapeutic class increased by 5.1 percentage points (95% CI, 1.8 to 8.4 percentage points), patient cost sharing increased by 10.3% (95% CI, -1.6% to -23.6%; this difference was not statistically significant), and prices paid decreased by 19.1% (95% CI, -30.2% to -6.2%) for Reta Trust patients compared with CalPERS patients. During the subsequent 2-year postimplementation period, the percentage of prescriptions made for the low-priced drug increased an additional 6.2 percentage points (95% CI, 2.3 to 10.1 percentage points), patient cost sharing decreased by 21.3% (95% CI, -31.2% to -9.9%), and prices paid increased by 7.2% (95% CI, -12.6% to 31.4%; this difference was not statistically significant). Relative to the change experienced by the CalPERS population, during the study period, the share of prescriptions for lower-priced drugs increased by 6.3 percentage points (8.9% relative increase), the mean prescription drug price decreased by $9.5 (12.1% relative decrease), and the mean patient cost sharing decreased by $1.8 (4.3% relative decrease).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, reference pricing was associated with a combination of lower prices paid by employers and lower cost sharing by employees but with a time lag in prescribing habits by physicians.

### The impact of phosphorus on projected sub-saharan Africa food security futures [^8df1aeed]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 
Projected food security parameters for Sub-Saharan Africa at different SSPs for the 21st Century

a Relative cost of food production in 2050 compared to 2010 where 2010 = 1.

However, food security is also a function of the relative risks of hunger which is partially controlled by wealth and production prices. In 2010 about 200 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa were at risk of hunger. Only sustainable SSP1 and fossil fuelled SSP5 will have a reduction in the relative risks of hunger—both dropping to 50 million people (i.e. 25% of 2010 levels). In both cases, this is partially due to changes in wealth and food production prices. SSP1 will have substantially reduced the relative production price at 59% of 2010 levels and have a good increase in wealth (3.21 times with GDP per capita at US$ 5300). Fossil fuelled SSP5 will have a slight increase in production price (1.04 times) but the increase in GDP per-capita (4.48 times at US$ 7300) far exceeds this (Table 1). MAGNET-IMAGE modelling suggests that under fossil fuelled SSP5 by the end of the century most sectors of society will benefit with the purchasing power of unskilled agricultural and non-agricultural labourers increasing by at least fourfold by 2100. Under nationalistic SSP3 and unequal SSP4 the risk of hunger is projected to increase to over 300 million people. Under SSP3 this is partially because despite moderate increases in GDP per capita (1.16 times at US$ 2400) production prices will substantially increase to 1.48 times the 2010 levels due to the increase in land prices (Table 1). Furthermore, by the end of the century, inequality on these pathways is likely to have increased and unskilled agricultural and non-agricultural labourers are likely to have had a reduction in their purchasing power at <10% of 2010 levels; this increases the risk of hunger.

### Trial-based economic evaluations in occupational health: principles, methods, and recommendations [^bc96a5aa]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In the economic evaluation literature, the need to consider presenteeism as a component of the costs incurred from productivity loss is increasingly being recognized.Presenteeism is typically estimated using participant self-report or report by others. For this purpose, various instruments have been developed, including both genericand disease-specific questionnaires.Most of these questionnaires measure work performance in terms of points, percentages, or proportions.These responses can then be used to estimate the total number of working days lost due to presenteeism by using the following equation:

where P is full working days lost because of presenteeism, E is total working days, A is sickness absence days, and p is the proportion of lost work performance estimated by the instrument used in the study.To value the number of lost working days due to presenteeism, actual wage rates of participants, or age-, gender-, and/or job-specific price weights can be used. Researchers should be aware, however, that the estimated number of work days lost because of presenteeism may vary widely between instruments. This suggests a lack of comparability among instruments, but it is still unclear which instrument provides the best presenteeism estimate.Given its significance, however, ignoring presenteeism may lead to severe underestimations.Therefore, researchers are recommended to include this resource use category whenever possible. To assess the possible influence of the choice of instrument, sensitivity analyses can be performed (see later).

Workers' Compensation Costs

Workers' compensation is an insurance program, offered in some countries (eg, Canada, the United States), through which workers may receive wage replacement and/or medical benefits in the event of an occupational injury or disease. Funding usually comes from premiums paid by employers.To estimate workers' compensation costs, total claim costs per participant can be obtained from company and/or workplace insurance records. It is generally inadequate, however, to use workers' compensation costs as the sole cost category, as they do not reflect the full extent of work-related injuries and illnesses.Many compensable injuries and illnesses go unreported and others are not compensable.When supplementing health care and/or productivity costs with workers' compensation costs, double counting should be avoided. Also, insurance premium-related wage replacement benefits should be excluded for the societal perspective, as they constitute “transfer payments” from the employer via the insurer to the worker rather than depleted sources.

### Financial arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^aeb56592]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

One target of the Sustainable Development Goals is to achieve "universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health‐care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all". A fundamental concern of governments in striving for this goal is how to finance such a health system. This concern is very relevant for low‐income countries.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the evidence from up‐to‐date systematic reviews about the effects of financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on financial arrangements, and informing refinements in the framework for financial arrangements presented in the overview.

Methods

We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ‐Evidence up to 17 December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language, or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well‐conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of financial arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty, employment, or financial burden of patients, e.g. out‐of‐pocket payment, catastrophic disease expenditure) and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence), and assessments of the relevance of findings to low‐income countries.

Main results

We identified 7272 reviews and included 15 in this overview, on: collection of funds (2 reviews), insurance schemes (1 review), purchasing of services (1 review), recipient incentives (6 reviews), and provider incentives (5 reviews). The reviews were published between 2008 and 2015; focused on 13 subcategories; and reported results from 276 studies: 115 (42%) randomised trials, 11 (4%) non‐randomised trials, 23 (8%) controlled before‐after studies, 51 (19%) interrupted time series, 9 (3%) repeated measures, and 67 (24%) other non‐randomised studies. Forty‐three per cent (119/276) of the studies included in the reviews took place in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Collection of funds : the effects of changes in user fees on utilisation and equity are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether aid delivered under the Paris Principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results, and mutual accountability) improves health outcomes compared to aid delivered without conforming to those principles (very low‐certainty evidence).

Insurance schemes : community‐based health insurance may increase service utilisation (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether social health insurance improves utilisation of health services or health outcomes (very low‐certainty evidence).

Purchasing of services : it is uncertain whether increasing salaries of public sector healthcare workers improves the quantity or quality of their work (very low‐certainty evidence).

Recipient incentives : recipient incentives may improve adherence to long‐term treatments (low‐certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether they improve patient outcomes. One‐time recipient incentives probably improve patient return for start or continuation of treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may improve return for tuberculosis test readings (low‐certainty evidence). However, incentives may not improve completion of tuberculosis prophylaxis, and it is uncertain whether they improve completion of treatment for active tuberculosis. Conditional cash transfer programmes probably lead to an increase in service utilisation (moderate‐certainty evidence), but their effects on health outcomes are uncertain. Vouchers may improve health service utilisation (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). Introducing a restrictive cap may decrease use of medicines for symptomatic conditions and overall use of medicines, may decrease insurers' expenditures on medicines (low‐certainty evidence), and has uncertain effects on emergency department use, hospitalisations, and use of outpatient care (very low‐certainty evidence). Reference pricing, maximum pricing, and index pricing for drugs have mixed effects on drug expenditures by patients and insurers as well as the use of brand and generic drugs.

Provider incentives : the effects of provider incentives are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence), including: the effects of provider incentives on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians or outpatient referrals from primary to secondary care, incentives for recruiting and retaining health professionals to serve in remote areas, and the effects of pay‐for‐performance on provider performance, the utilisation of services, patient outcomes, or resource use in low‐income countries.

Authors' conclusions

Research based on sound systematic review methods has evaluated numerous financial arrangements relevant to low‐income countries, targeting different levels of the health systems and assessing diverse outcomes. However, included reviews rarely reported social outcomes, resource use, equity impacts, or undesirable effects. We also identified gaps in primary research because of uncertainty about applicability of the evidence to low‐income countries. Financial arrangements for which the effects are uncertain include external funding (aid), caps and co‐payments, pay‐for‐performance, and provider incentives. Further studies evaluating the effects of these arrangements are needed in low‐income countries. Systematic reviews should include all outcomes that are relevant to decision‐makers and to people affected by changes in financial arrangements.

### The return of austerity imperils global health [^dbfa89cf]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

What are the prospects of national health budgets increasing?

We sought an answer in the IMF’s October 2022 economic projections for the near term. These are published biannually in the World Economic Outlook, an influential report consulted by policy makers around the world, and especially by close observers of national economies like banks and credit rating agencies, whose decisions determine the ability of governments to raise funds and the terms on which they do so.In effect, projections become prescriptions for many LMICs, especially those that turn to the IMF for financial support, where they are inscribed as conditions the country must meet for loans to be disbursed. Since January 2021, 46 countries have received such conditional support.

The IMF’s public expenditure projections in figure 1 show that austerity is back on the agenda in almost half of LMICs, and this is likely to be an overoptimistic estimate as IMF projections tend to have an optimism bias.Almost all governments had spent more in 2020, averaging a 2.2 percentage point year-on-year increase as a share of GDP to support their citizens and businesses through the acute phase of the pandemic, but this spending is already being rolled back. By 2024, 59 (out of 125) LMICs are expected to spend less than their average expenditure as a share of GDP during the 2010s, exposing a total of 2.0 billion people to the health consequences of budget cuts. Many of those projecting no change or a small increase, as in West and Central Africa, are already spending very little.

Figure 1 
Government expenditure changes as a share of GDP in low-income and middle-income countries, 2010s vs 2024.

This upcoming wave of austerity builds on a legacy of decline in public spending, which accounted for an average 28.6% of GDP in LMICs in 2019, representing a drop of 0.6 percentage points compared with 2010. As a result, public spending on health had, between 2015 and 2019, stagnated: the median LMIC government spent only 2.1% of GDP on health; and the average LMIC resident lived in a country whose government spent 2.0% of GDP on health (calculated on a population-weighted basis).In other words, the projected cuts will compound the effects of past austerity that, in many cases, had reduced preparedness for the pandemic and may have necessitated even higher countercyclical fiscal efforts when it occurred.

### Are lower income smokers more price sensitive?: the evidence from Korean cigarette tax increases [^50035d30]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The cigarette excise taxes and the price of a typical pack of cigarettes in Korea have not increased since 2005, and effective tax rate as a fraction of price and real price of cigarettes have both been falling. As smoking prevalence is higher among lower income people than among higher income people in Korea, the regressivity of cigarette excise taxes is often cited as a barrier to tobacco tax and price policy. While studies in several other high-income countries have shown that higher income individuals are less price sensitive, few studies have examined the differential impact of cigarette tax increases by income group in Korea. Most of the Korean literature has estimated the demand for cigarettes using time-series aggregate sales data or household level survey data, which record household cigarette expenditures rather than individual cigarette consumption. Studies using survey data often lack time-series variation and estimate cigarette demand using household expenditure data, while studies using time-series aggregate sales data lack cross-sectional variation.

Objective

I examine differences in the effects of cigarette price on the cigarette consumption of various income groups using individual-level cigarette consumption records from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KHNNES). I also analyse the implications of cigarette taxes and price increases on the relative tax burdens of different income groups.

Design

I use pooled data from the KNHNES for the 1998-2011 period to estimate the price elasticity of cigarette consumption of four income groups. Treating cigarette consumption as a latent variable, I employ an econometric procedure that corrects for non-random sample selection, or the fact that some non-smokers might have smoked at a low enough price, and estimate the price elasticity of cigarette consumption by income group. The estimated price elasticities include the responsiveness of potential smokers as well as current smokers.

Results

Lower income Korean smokers are more responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes. While the overall price elasticity of cigarettes is estimated to be -0.425, the price elasticity of the lowest income quartile is estimated to be -0.812, whereas that of the highest income quartile is estimated to be -0.325.

Conclusions

The estimated price elasticities of different income groups imply that the cigarette tax and price increases in Korea would reduce smoking more in those with lower incomes. For a given price increase, the percentage reduction in cigarette consumption among smokers in the lowest income quartile is 2.5 times greater than among smokers in the top income quartile. The simulated tax burdens of different income groups show that the additional burden of a tax increase and the associated price rise is largely borne by higher income smokers.

### Cost-benefit analysis of vaccination: a comparative analysis of eight approaches for valuing changes to mortality and morbidity risks [^a4367a4a]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Measuring lost production by using wage rates raises a number of methodological questions, including (1) whether or not to assume full employment (we capture this uncertainty by showing results using both HC, which assumes full employment and competitive labour markets, and FC, which does not make these assumptions), (2) whether the economic value of lost productivity is best captured by the employer perspective (so measured in pre-tax wages including fringe benefits and indirect costs) or employee perspective (so measured in post-tax wages), and (3) how to capture labour market constraints on how much work an individual does, since there may be requirements to work a fixed number of hours. For example, Bockstael et al. found that individuals who are required to work a fixed number of hours valued the opportunity cost of time approximately 3.5-fold more than the wage rate, whereas those with flexible working hours valued it similarly to their wage rate.
