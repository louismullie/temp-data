## Question

can prevnar 20 vaccine be given with other vaccines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Prevnar 20 (PCV20) can be given at the same time as other vaccines, and under what conditions this is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications for PCV20. Then, I should verify ACIP's general best-practice guidance on coadministration. Next, I will examine direct evidence for coadministration with influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in adults, followed by pediatric data on concomitant administration with routine childhood vaccines. After that, I need to check for any exceptions or spacing rules, especially regarding PPSV23. Finally, I will synthesize practical administration guidance and a clear conclusion with caveats about reactogenicity and site selection.

> Let me first confirm the vaccine and its status. Prevnar 20 is a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) approved for active immunization in individuals 6 weeks of age and older, with pediatric and adult indications reflected in FDA materials and CDC summaries, which establishes the foundation for considering coadministration across age groups [^1139envF] [^117Kvrnj].

> Next, I should review the overarching immunization principle. ACIP's General Best Practice Guidelines endorse routine coadministration of age-appropriate vaccines at the same visit when no contraindications exist, which directly supports giving PCV20 with other vaccines in both adults and children, provided standard precautions are followed [^114FNMjG] [^114pmBtU].

> Now, I will examine adult coadministration data with influenza vaccines. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of any immunogenicity impact. Multiple ACIP documents and CDC guidance state that PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 can be coadministered with inactivated influenza vaccine, noting that while pneumococcal antibody responses may be numerically lower when given concomitantly, noninferiority criteria are generally met and the approach is considered safe and immunogenic, with similar findings for PCV21 coadministration with quadrivalent influenza vaccine in adults [^1157Leyw] [^114FNMjG] [^113DzYyc].

> I need to check COVID-19 vaccine coadministration next. Hold on, I should verify whether PCV20-specific data exist. ACIP notes that in adults aged ≥ 65 years who received BNT162b2, coadministration with PCV20 resulted in slightly lower pneumococcal OPA GMTs that were not statistically significant, with similar overall adverse event rates, supporting coadministration when indicated, and a randomized trial of an Omicron-adapted Novavax COVID-19 vaccine coadministered with PCV20 in adults ≥ 60 years demonstrated noninferior immunogenicity and similar reactogenicity, further reinforcing feasibility at the same visit [^114FNMjG] [^1139VMe8].

> Let me consider pediatric coadministration with routine childhood vaccines. I should confirm whether PCV20 has been studied alongside DTaP, IPV, Hib, hepatitis B, rotavirus, MMR, and varicella. Pediatric trials of PCV20 used concomitant administration with combination vaccines such as Pediarix (DTaP-HepB-IPV) and Hib, and allowed rotavirus and MMR with the toddler dose, with immune responses to concomitant antigens generally comparable to PCV13 comparators, aligning with long-standing pediatric practice for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [^115zADBx] [^115RCdUL] [^115Bgzv3].

> But wait, what about exceptions or spacing rules that could complicate coadministration. I should double-check the guidance on PCV and PPSV23 sequencing. ACIP advises against administering PCV13 and PPSV23 concomitantly and specifies minimum intervals when PPSV23 follows PCV, reflecting immunologic interference concerns; while this PCV13-PPSV23 rule is the clearest exception, it underscores a general principle that within-pneumococcal-series combinations may require spacing, whereas coadministration with non-pneumococcal vaccines is routinely supported when otherwise appropriate [^113wcUUL] [^117NXE94] [^114FNMjG].

> I will now examine practical administration details to ensure safety. Injectable vaccines given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites using different syringes, and vaccines must not be mixed in the same syringe; for infants the anterolateral thigh is preferred, whereas in older children and adults the deltoid is appropriate, with avoidance of the gluteal area to minimize risk of neurovascular injury [^11379Qxj] [^115RmxMB].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overgeneralizing. Yes, Prevnar 20 can be administered concomitantly with other vaccines, including inactivated influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines in adults, and with routine pediatric vaccines in children, recognizing that minor reductions in antibody titers may occur without compromising clinical protection and that reactogenicity may be slightly higher when multiple vaccines are given together. The key exceptions pertain to sequencing within pneumococcal vaccine series, particularly avoiding concomitant administration of PCV with PPSV23 and observing recommended intervals when PPSV23 is indicated after PCV [^114FNMjG] [^1157Leyw] [^117Kvrnj] [^113wcUUL].

> Final answer: Yes, Prevnar 20 can be coadministered at the same visit with other age-appropriate vaccines, including influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in adults and routine childhood vaccines in infants and children, provided they are given at separate injection sites with different syringes and there are no patient-specific contraindications. Observe pneumococcal-series spacing rules if PPSV23 is indicated and counsel that transient increases in local or systemic reactogenicity are possible [^114FNMjG] [^1157Leyw] [^1139VMe8] [^115zADBx] [^11379Qxj].

Prevnar 20 (PCV20) **can be coadministered** with other vaccines, including influenza, COVID-19, and routine pediatric vaccines, based on ACIP and CDC guidance [^114FNMjG] [^115zADBx]. Coadministration is **safe and immunogenic**, though pneumococcal antibody responses may be slightly lower when given with influenza or COVID-19 vaccines; clinical significance is unclear and protection is expected to remain adequate [^1157Leyw] [^114FNMjG]. Use separate injection sites and syringes, and avoid mixing with other vaccines in the same syringe [^11379Qxj]. If PCV15 is used, administer PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later; PCV20 or PCV21 alone do not require additional PPSV23 [^111z4pRM].

## Clinical evidence supporting coadministration

### Pediatric population

- **Routine pediatric vaccines**: PCV20 has been coadministered with DTaP, IPV, Hib, hepatitis B, rotavirus, MMR, and varicella vaccines in infants and toddlers, with no significant interference in immunogenicity or safety [^115zADBx] [^115RCdUL].

- **Immunogenicity**: Coadministration with routine pediatric vaccines did not significantly alter immune responses to PCV20 or concomitant vaccines, supporting routine coadministration [^115Bgzv3].

- **Safety**: No significant increase in adverse events or serious adverse events was observed when PCV20 was coadministered with routine pediatric vaccines [^notfound].

---

### Adult population

- **Influenza vaccine**: PCV20 coadministered with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) was immunogenic and safe, though pneumococcal antibody responses were slightly lower than with PCV20 alone; clinical significance is unclear and protection is expected to remain adequate [^1157Leyw] [^114FNMjG].

- **COVID-19 vaccine**: PCV20 coadministered with COVID-19 vaccines (e.g. BNT162b2, NVX-CoV2601) was safe and immunogenic, with noninferior immune responses and manageable reactogenicity [^114FNMjG] [^1139VMe8].

- **Other vaccines**: PCV20 has been coadministered with other vaccines (e.g. Tdap, hepatitis B, zoster) without significant safety or immunogenicity concerns, though data are more limited and ongoing evaluation continues [^notfound].

---

## Official recommendations and guidelines

ACIP/CDC recommend **routine coadministration** of PCV20 with other age-appropriate vaccines at the same visit, using separate injection sites and syringes [^114FNMjG] [^117Kvrnj]. For **intervals**, if PCV15 is used, administer PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later; PCV20 or PCV21 alone do not require additional PPSV23 [^1157Leyw] [^111z4pRM].

---

## Potential interactions and considerations

- **Immune interference**: Slightly lower pneumococcal antibody responses may occur when coadministered with influenza or COVID-19 vaccines, but clinical significance is unclear and protection is expected to remain adequate [^1157Leyw] [^114FNMjG].

- **Reactogenicity**: Coadministration may increase local or systemic reactions (e.g. pain, fatigue, fever), but these are generally mild and self-limited [^114FNMjG] [^113GVjd5].

- **Injection site management**: Use separate injection sites (different limbs) and syringes to minimize local reactions and ensure proper vaccine delivery [^11379Qxj].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Vaccine combination** | **Immunogenicity** | **Safety** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PCV20 + routine pediatric vaccines | No significant interference | Well tolerated | Recommended |
| PCV20 + influenza vaccine | Slightly lower pneumococcal responses, but acceptable | Well tolerated | Recommended |
| PCV20 + COVID-19 vaccine | Noninferior immune responses | Well tolerated | Recommended |
| PCV20 + other adult vaccines | Limited data, but no significant concerns | Limited data, but no significant concerns | Recommended with caution |

---

Prevnar 20 **can be coadministered** with other vaccines, including routine pediatric vaccines, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines, with no significant loss of immunogenicity or safety concerns. Use separate injection sites and syringes, and follow ACIP/CDC guidance on intervals when PCV15 is used.

MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

On June 20, 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.) for adults aged ≥ 19 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or cochlear implants. PCV13 should be administered to eligible adults in addition to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax 23, Merck & Co. Inc.), the vaccine currently recommended for these groups of adults. The evidence for the benefits and risk of PCV13 vaccination of adults with immunocompromising conditions was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and designated as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new ACIP recommendations for PCV13 use; explains the recommendations for the use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants; and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make its recommendations.

Safety and Immunogenicity Studies

Across the 6 safety and immunogenicity studies,6–11serious adverse events within 1 month of vaccination were reported after an initial study dose in 0.2%–1.4% of 5,057 subjects vaccinated with Prevnar 13, and in 0.4%–1.7% of 1,124 subjects vaccinated after an initial study dose of PPSV23. From 1 month to 6 months after an initial study dose, serious adverse events were reported in 0.2%–5.8% of subjects vaccinated during the studies with Prevnar 13 and in 2.4%–5.5% of subjects vaccinated with PPSV23. One case of erythema multiforme occurred 34 days after receipt of a second dose of Prevnar 13.

Twelve of 5,667 (0.21%) Prevnar 13 recipients and 4 of 1,391 (0.29%) PPSV23 recipients died. Deaths occurred between Day 3 and Day 309 after study vaccination with Prevnar 13 or PPSV23. Two of 12 deaths occurred within 30 days of vaccination and both deaths were in subjects > 65 years of age. One death due to cardiac failure occurred 3 days after receiving placebo. This subject had received Prevnar 13 and IIV3 one month earlier. The other death was due to peritonitis 20 days after receiving Prevnar 13. The reported causes of the 10 remaining deaths occurring greater than 30 days after receiving Prevnar 13 were cardiac disorders (4), neoplasms (4), Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary infection (1) and septic shock (1).

Vaccination studies

For antiserum generation and pneumonia/meningitis challenge studies, female 5- to 6-week CD1 mice (Charles River) were vaccinated on day 0 intraperitoneally with recombinant (glyco)proteins singly (10 µg/mouse/injection) or in combination (Combo/Combo(Sp4), 4 µg each protein/mouse/vaccination) emulsified 1:1 in Sigma adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 µl of Prevnar-13 (Wyeth) diluted 1:5 PBS, or PBS and Sigma adjuvant alone. Booster immunisations were given subcutaneously on days 21 and 35. In pneumonia and meningitis infection experiments, mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 10 7 CFU of TIGR4 or 2 × 10 6 CFU of WCH43 in 50 µl PBS under deep isoflurane anaesthesia and culled after 24 or 48 h, respectively. Colonisation studies were performed using mice vaccinated intraperitoneally as outlined above and boosted intranasally under light isoflurane anaesthesia with 2 µg of the combination vaccines, 20 µl of diluted Prevnar-13 or PBS. Mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 10 7 CFU of TIGR4 in 20 µl PBS under light isoflurane anaesthesia, culled 7 days post-infection, and degree of colonisation assessed by plating serial dilutions of nasal washes. Samples sizes were selected based on previous studies. No randomisation or blinding was performed. All animal procedures were approved by the local ethical review process and conducted in accordance with the relevant, UK Home Office approved, project license (PPL70/6510).

Development of current clinical pneumococcal vaccines

One of the earliest iterations of an Spn vaccine, Pneumovax® PPSV23, came into the market in 1983 and was formulated as a multivalent vaccine using purified Spn CPSs isolated from the 23 serotypes responsible for the majority of IPD cases (Table 1). It was found to be efficient in adult and elderly populations, but poorly immunogenic in children and immunocompromised patients and had the drawback of requiring multiple doses as the efficacy of vaccine-elicited protection would wane without the ability to generate T cell-dependent immunity. The lack of protective immunity in the populations at highest risk of IPD and the variable responses and waning of immunity over time in the elderly represented an important challenge concerning vaccine-elicited protection against Spn. In 2000, the multivalent Prevnar™ PCV7 was introduced to protect against the seven most virulent serotypes of S. pneumoniae through the preparation of individual serotype conjugates that are prepared and combined into multivalent formulations. Using purified CPSs that are first chemically modified to enable covalent attachment to CRM 197, a genetically detoxified form of diphtheria toxin, the first commercially available conjugate vaccine against Spn was generated (Table 1). Updated versions of PCV7 have been released, covering additional serotypes from the 13-valent PCV13 up to the most recent 20-valent PCV20 (Table 1). Other carrier proteins have been explored, with the 10-valent Synflorix™ an example of a clinically available PCV that uses multiple carriers in its formulation, tetanus toxoid, and protein D from nontypeable H. influenzae.

PCV21 Immunogenicity

Findings from one phase II and three phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the immunogenicity of PCV21 (as measured by opsonophagocytic activity ** [OPA] geometric mean titers [GMT] and percentage of seroresponders ††) to that of comparator vaccines (PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23). One study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of PCV21 with concomitant or sequential administration of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV).

Among immunocompetent, pneumococcal vaccine–naive adults aged ≥ 50 years, PCV21 met noninferiority criteria for serotypes shared with comparator vaccines (PPSV23 and PCV20). PCV21 elicited statistically significantly higher immune responses for most serotypes unique to PCV21, with the exception of serotype 15C, although the immune response was numerically higher when compared with PCV20.

Among immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years who had previously received a pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 or PPSV23) ≥ 1 year before enrollment, PCV21 demonstrated comparable immunogenicity for shared serotypes and was immunogenic for unique serotypes compared with PPSV23 or PCV15; among adults who had previously received PPSV23 followed by or preceded by PCV13, PPSV23 preceded by PCV15, or PCV15 alone, PCV21 was immunogenic for all serotypes. Among adults aged ≥ 18 years living with HIV, comparison of recipients of PCV15 followed by PPSV23 8 weeks later with recipients of PCV21 followed by placebo 8 weeks later showed comparable immunogenicity for shared serotypes and was immunogenic for unique serotypes.

Among immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years who received PCV21 and QIV concomitantly or sequentially, coadministration of PCV21 and QIV resulted in numerically lower pneumococcal and influenza antibody titers compared with sequential administration. Coadministration of PCV21 and QIV met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity §§ for all except pneumococcal serotype 23B and influenza strain A/H3N2.

Introduction

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a common bacterial cause of respiratory tract infections, bacteremia, and meningitis. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), a pneumococcal infection in a normally sterile site (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone, or joint space), can result in severe morbidity or mortality. Adults with certain underlying conditions or risk factors that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease (risk conditions) * and those aged ≥ 65 years are at increased risk and have experienced IPD case fatality ratios exceeding 10%.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends receipt of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) by all adults aged ≥ 65 years as well as those aged 19–64 years with a risk condition who have not received PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options include either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23, Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC). Additional recommendations for use of PCV20 exist for adults who commenced their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).

On June 17, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration licensed 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) for use in persons aged ≥ 18 years. PCV21 does not contain certain serotypes in other licensed vaccines but adds eight new serotypes (Figure). This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP regarding the use of PCV21 for adults, highlighting considerations of immunogenicity, safety, and resource use.

Coadministration With Other Vaccines

Concomitant administration of PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 with seasonal inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (specifically, PCV15 or PPSV23 and IIV4 [Fluarix] and PCV20 and adjuvanted IIV4 [Fluad]) has been demonstrated to be immunogenic and safe in adults. However, numerically lower pneumococcal serotype–specific OPA GMTs or GMCs were reported for certain serotypes when pneumococcal vaccines were coadministered with IIV4 compared with administration of pneumococcal vaccines alone.

Among adults aged ≥ 65 years who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine with the second BNT162b2 dose administered ≥ 6 months previous, slightly lower pneumococcal serotype–specific OPA GMTs were reported when PCV20 was coadministered with BNT162b2 compared with administration of PCV20 alone; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Pain at injection site within 10 days after vaccination and systemic events within 7 days after vaccination were reported more frequently among the group that received both PCV20 and BNT162b2 compared with the group that received PCV20 alone. The percentage of participants who reported any adverse events through 1 month after vaccination was similar across groups (PCV20 and BNT162b2 coadministration: 5.3% [95% CI = 2.6%–9.6%]; PCV20 only: 4.3% [95% CI = 1.9%–8.3%]; BNT162b2 only: 6.5% [95% CI = 3.4%–11.1%]). No data are available on PCV20 coadministration with other COVID-19 vaccines. Evaluation of coadministration of PCV15 or PPSV23 with COVID-19 vaccines among adults aged ≥ 50 years is ongoing. In adults aged ≥ 50 years who received 2 doses of adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), immune responses to coadministration of RZV and PPSV23 were noninferior to those in this age group who received these vaccines in sequence. Solicited adverse reactions were reported more frequently when the first doses of RZV and PPSV23 were coadministered. No data are available on coadministration with other vaccines (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine, or hepatitis B vaccine) in adults.

Serotype selection in clinical formulations

Determination of the specific serotypes selected for inclusion in commercial formulations is an essential consideration in combating IPD, as there is some known heterogeneity in the reported prevalence and distribution of the serotypes on a global scale. Insight into the incidence rates caused by specific strains is critical in manufacturing vaccines, as this will drive vaccine policy and protective coverage. Overall, seven serotypes (1, 5, 6A, 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F) have been found to be the most common IPD-causing strains, with global analyses illustrating that two-thirds of all cases are isolates of these strains. By further increasing the number of serotypes covered in PCV formulations, most strains responsible for IPD can be targeted. Prevnar 13®, the 13-valent PCV, was able to cover 76% of strains responsible for children under the age of five, with an estimated 78% reduction in IPD vaccine-related serotypes after introduction in the United States. The updated 20-valent iteration now covers approximately 90% of total IPD serotypes. The regional burden of particular serotypes varies, with current formulations more specifically protecting North American and European populations, whereas Asian and African IPD cases are due to a wider variety of serotypes. Considerations must be made regarding what serotypes are selected for, as the current cumulative approach of continually adding serotypes in formulation does not account for possible evolutionary dynamics or the possible dampening of the immune response as the breadth of antigens introduced each vaccine increases. Further limitations exist outside the approach used to generate conjugate molecules and the selection of serotypes in formulations that drive vaccine policy.

Pneumococcal vaccination in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — in COPD, injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community-acquired pneumonia, though reduction of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia has not been shown; PPSV23 has been shown to reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in COPD patients < 65 years with an FEV1 < 40% predicted or comorbidities, and PCV13 has been shown to exhibit at least the same or greater immunogenicity than PPSV23 up to two years after vaccination; in a large RCT, PCV13 demonstrated significant efficacy for prevention of vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (45.6%) and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (75%) among adults ≥ 65 years with efficacy persisting for at least 4 years; PCV20 covers up to 58% of those strains, while PCV21 covers up to 84% of strains responsible for invasive disease in adults; pneumococcal vaccine can be co-administered with influenza vaccine in adult programs, and concomitant administration (PCV15 or PPSV23 and QIV [Fluarix], PCV20 and adjuvanted QIV [Fluad]) has been demonstrated to be immunogenic and safe.

### New pneumococcal vaccines for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112a8QNj]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a high risk of developing invasive pneumococcal infection both before and after they are diagnosed. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices now endorses use of 2 new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, PCV15 (Vaxneuvance) and PCV20 (Prevnar 20), for patients who have never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or those with unknown vaccination history. Previous studies have shown that pneumococcal vaccination can decrease the risk of developing severe pneumococcal disease; therefore, it is important that patients with IBD receive pneumococcal vaccination. This report aims to inform clinicians who care for patients with IBD about the changes in immunization practices, as it pertains to pneumococcal vaccination and provides appropriate direction on administering vaccination series.

7.1 Concomitant Immunizations

In clinical trials with infants and toddlers, Prevnar 13 was administered concomitantly with the following US-licensed vaccines: Pediarix [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Combined] (DTaP-HBV-IPV) and ActHIB [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)] (PRP-T) for the first three doses and with PedvaxHIB [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate)] (PRP-OMP), M-M-R II [Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine Live] (MMR) and Varivax [Varicella Virus Vaccine Live], or ProQuad [Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live] (MMRV) and VAQTA [Hepatitis A vaccine, Inactivated] (HepA) for dose 4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In children and adolescents, data are insufficient to assess the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) and Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Tdap).

In adults, Prevnar 13 was administered concomitantly with US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccines, trivalent and quadrivalent (Studies 10, 11 and 13) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. There are no data on the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines and other vaccines licensed for use in adults 50 years of age and older.

When Prevnar 13 is administered at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should always be administered with different syringes and given at different injection sites.

Do not mix Prevnar 13 with other vaccines/products in the same syringe.

7.2 Immunosuppressive Therapies

Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy (including irradiation, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and cytotoxic agents) may not respond optimally to active immunization.

For new ACIP recommendations in this report, a systematic literature search that was performed in February 2021 was updated to review available evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of PCV15 and PCV20 among adults. GRADE was only used for evidence on PCV20 use in adults who previously received PCV13. To identify additional literature published during March 2021–March 2022, PubMed Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane library databases were searched using the previous search terms. Search results were supplemented by a search of ClinicalTrials.gov using the term "20-valent pneumococcal vaccine, adults" and PubMed Medline using the terms "PCV20" or "20-valent pneumococcal vaccine". Unpublished data from trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov but not yet publicly available were provided by the vaccine manufacturers. Evidence on safety and immunogenicity of PCV20 among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine was assessed using GRADE.

Clinical Trials Experience With Prevnar 13 in Children 5 Through 17 Years of Age

In a US study5(Study 5), the safety of Prevnar 13 was evaluated in children 5 through 9 years of age previously immunized with at least one dose of Prevnar, and in children 10 through 17 years of age with no prior pneumococcal vaccination. In this open label trial, 592 children, including those with asthma, received a single dose of Prevnar 13. The percentage of children 5 through 9 years of age who received 3 and 4 prior doses of Prevnar was 29.1% and 54.5% respectively.

Most subjects were White (72.8%), 21.8% were Black or African-American, and 1.5% were Asian; 91.4% of subjects were non-Hispanic and non-Latino and 8.6% were Hispanic or Latino. Overall, 51.2% of subjects were male.

The incidence and severity of solicited adverse reactions that occurred within 7 days following one dose of Prevnar 13 administered to children 5 through 17 years of age are shown in Tables 9 and 10.

The safety of Prevnar 13 was assessed in 7 clinical studies (Studies 6–12)6–12conducted in the US and Europe which included 91,593 adults (48,806 received Prevnar 13) ranging in age from 18 through 101 years.

The 48,806 Prevnar 13 recipients included 899 adults who were aged 18 through 49 years, 2,616 adults who were aged 50 through 64 years, 45,291 adults aged 65 years and older. Of the 48,806 Prevnar 13 recipients, 46,890 adults had not previously received Pneumovax®23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [23-valent], PPSV23) ("PPSV23 unvaccinated") and 1,916 adults were previously vaccinated ("PPSV23 previously vaccinated") with PPSV23 at least 3 years prior to enrollment.

Clinical Guidance

Dosing schedule. When PCV15 is used, the recommended interval between administration of PCV15 and PPSV23 is ≥ 1 year. A minimum interval of 8 weeks can be considered for adults with an immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak to minimize the risk for IPD caused by serotypes unique to PPSV23 in these vulnerable groups.

Adults with previous PPSV23 only. Adults who have only received PPSV23 may receive a PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15) ≥ 1 year after their last PPSV23 dose. When PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23.

Adults with previous PCV13. The incremental public health benefits of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated. These adults should complete the previously recommended PPSV23 ††††† series.

Coadministration with other vaccines. PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 can be coadministered with QIV in an adult immunization program, as concomitant administration (PCV15 or PPSV23 and QIV [Fluarix], PCV20 and adjuvanted QIV [Fluad]) has been demonstrated to be immunogenic and safe. However, slightly lower pneumococcal serotype-specific OPA GMTs or geometric mean concentrations were reported when pneumococcal vaccines were coadministered with QIV compared with when pneumococcal vaccines were given alone. Currently, no data are available on coadministration with other vaccines (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine, hepatitis B, or zoster vaccine) among adults. Evaluation of coadministration of PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 with COVID-19 vaccines is ongoing.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Prevnar 13 administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.

A developmental toxicity study has been performed in female rabbits administered Prevnar 13 prior to mating and during gestation. Each dose was approximately 20 times the human dose. This study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to Prevnar 13 (see 8.1 Data).

Data

Animal

In a developmental toxicity study, female rabbits were administered Prevnar 13 by intramuscular injection twice prior to mating (17 days and 3 days prior to mating) and twice during gestation (gestation days 10 and 24), 0.5 mL/rabbit/occasion (each dose approximately 20 times the human dose). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data are not available to assess the effects of Prevnar 13 on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Prevnar 13 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Prevnar 13 or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Prevnar 13 in children below the age of 6 weeks have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of Prevnar 13 recipients aged 50 years and older in clinical studies (N = 47,907), 94.5% (45,291 of 47,907) were 65 years and older and 30.3% (14,498 of 47,907) were 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and (14.3)].

8.6 High Risk Populations

Individuals with the diseases or conditions listed below are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease. Immunogenicity and safety data in these populations are limited.

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^115dFeh9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — recommended immunizations for adults with cancer specify the following schedules: Influenza for all ages is given annually; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for adults 60 years and older is given once; COVID-19 for all ages follows the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule for immunocompromised; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) or tetanus and diphtheria (Td) for 19 years and older is one dose of Tdap followed by Td or Tdap booster every 10 years; hepatitis B for adults 20 years and older uses high antigen (40 μg) administered as a three-dose Recombivax HB series (0, 1, 6 months) or a four-dose Engerix-B series (0, 1, 2, 6 months); recombinant zoster vaccine for 19 years and older is two doses at least 4 weeks apart; pneumococcal vaccine for 19 years and older is one dose PCV15 followed by pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) 8 weeks later or one dose PCV20, with the note that patients who previously received PCV13 only can receive one dose of PCV 20 after an interval of 1 year; and human papillomavirus (HPV) indicates 19–26 years: eligible and 27–45 years: shared decision making, with a three-dose schedule of 0, 1–2, 6-months. Administration guidance states coadministration of two or more of the recommended nonlive vaccines is acceptable and, when given on separate days, there is no recommended waiting period, but PCV-15 and PPSV-23 should be separated by at least 8 weeks, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is administered as a nasal spray, cannot be given to patients with cancer.

Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines

With regard to administration of influenza vaccines with vaccines other than COVID-19 vaccines, guidance is as follows. IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, then after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4), at least 4 weeks should pass before another live vaccine is administered.

Guidance concerning administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines indicates that these vaccines may be given with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. No data are yet available concerning coadministration of U.S.-authorized COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines. Providers should be aware of the potential for increased reactogenicity with coadministration and should consult the CDC guidance as more information becomes available. If administered simultaneously, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause a local reaction (e.g. aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible.

### Licensure of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and recommendations for use among children-advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2010 [^115GK1Ag]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On February 24, 2010, a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes covered by the vaccine and for prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulation (PCV7 [Prevnar, Wyeth]). PCV13 is approved for use among children aged 6 weeks-71 months and succeeds PCV7, which was licensed by FDA in 2000. The Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed available data on the immunogenicity, safety, and cost-effectiveness of PCV13, and on estimates of the vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease burden. The working group then presented policy options for consideration of the full ACIP. This report summarizes recommendations approved by ACIP on February 24, 2010, for 1) routine vaccination of all children aged 2–59 months with PCV13, 2) vaccination with PCV13 of children aged 60–71 months with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease or complications, and 3) PCV13 vaccination of children who previously received 1 or more doses of PCV7. CDC guidance for vaccination providers regarding transition from PCV7 to the PCV13 immunization program also is included.

### Immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine and DTPa-IPV-hib when coadministered as a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule in the Netherlands: a randomized controlled trial [^1179W8P3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent reviews have highlighted the unpredictability of immunologic interference when multivalent conjugated vaccines are coadministered with other pediatric vaccines.

Objective

To evaluate immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and DTPa-IPV-Hib (Pediacel, Sanofi Pasteur MSD) when coadministered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course.

Material and Methods

In a single-blind, single-center, randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands, healthy infants (n = 780) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either (1) PHiD-CV + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix Hexa, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), (2) PHiD-CV + DTPa-IPV-Hib, or (3) 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar/Prevnar, Pfizer Inc.) + DTPa-IPV-Hib at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. Blood samples were collected 1 month after dose 3. Diary cards were used to record safety and reactogenicity.

Results

Antibody concentrations elicited by PHiD-CV coadministered with DTPa-IPV-Hib were noninferior to those following DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib coadministration for 9 of 10 vaccines pneumococcal serotypes and protein D. For serotype 18C (conjugated to tetanus toxoid), the antibody concentration was higher with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib coadministration (1.73 vs. 1.07 μg/mL). The percentages of infants with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL (68.9%-100% in the PHiD-CV + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group vs. 64.9%-100% in the PHiD-CV + DTPa-IPV-Hib group) and with measurable opsonophagocytic activity (56.1%-100% in the PHiD-CV + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group vs. 61.1%-100% in the PHiD-CV + DTPa-IPV-Hib group) were comparable for all serotypes in both PHiD-CV groups. Group differences in antibody responses to the DTPa-IPV-Hib antigens remained within the predefined limit for noninferiority. Safety and reactogenicity profiles were comparable across groups.

Conclusions

PHiD-CV and DTPa-IPV-Hib were immunogenic and well tolerated when coadministered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1172EPTF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

On August 13, 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) among adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 should be administered in series with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax23, Merck & Co. Inc.]), the vaccine currently recommended for adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2011 for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of PCV13 for preventing community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years with no prior pneumococcal vaccination history (CAPiTA trial) became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new recommendations for PCV13 use, provides guidance for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information regarding ACIP is available at.

### Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) [^117ACcMs]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The vaccine efficacy against AOM episodes due to vaccine serotypes assessed in the Finnish trial, was 57% (95% CI: 44%, 67%) in the per-protocol population and 54% (95% CI: 41%, 64%) in the intent-to-treat population. The vaccine efficacy against AOM episodes due to vaccine-related serotypes (6A, 9N, 18B, 19A, 23A), also assessed in the Finnish trial, was 51% (95% CI: 27, 67) in the per-protocol population and 44% (95% CI: 20, 62) in the intent-to-treat population. There was a nonsignificant increase in AOM episodes caused by serotypes unrelated to the vaccine in the per-protocol population, compared to children who received the control vaccine, suggesting that children who received Prevnar appeared to be at increased risk of otitis media due to pneumococcal serotypes not represented in the vaccine. However, vaccination with Prevnar reduced pneumococcal otitis media episodes overall. In the NCKP trial, in which the endpoint was all otitis media episodes regardless of etiology, vaccine efficacy was 7% (95% CI: 4%, 10%) and 6% (95% CI: 4%, 9%), respectively, in the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Several other otitis media endpoints were also assessed in the two trials.

Recurrent AOM, defined as 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes in 12 months, was reduced by 9% in both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations (95% CI: 3%, 15% in per-protocol and 95% CI: 4%, 14% in intent-to-treat) in the NCKP trial; a similar trend was observed in the Finnish trial. The NCKP trial also demonstrated a 20% reduction (95% CI: 2, 35) in the placement of tympanostomy tubes in the per-protocol population and a 21% reduction (95% CI: 4, 34) in the intent-to-treat population. Data from the NCKP trial accumulated through an extended follow-up period to April 20, 1999, in which a total of 37,866 children were included (18,925 in Prevnar group and 18,941 in MnCC control group), resulted in similar otitis media efficacy estimates for all endpoints.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers and infants [^11585dGp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In cohort 1, the 3 PCV21 formulations induced an immune response comparable to that of PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes in toddlers who had received 3 doses of PCV13 before the study. However, as expected, only the PCV21 formulations elicited a robust antibody response to the 8 additional serotypes. OPA assays indicated a functional response for all serotypes in the PCV21 groups and the results were consistent with the IgG results. These results suggest that PCV21 could be used in place of PCV13 following initial vaccination with PCV13 in infancy.

In cohort 2, all PCV21 formulations demonstrated immunogenicity after the third and fourth doses. The response to the fourth dose at age 12–15 months indicated a memory response following the initial 3 doses given at ages 2, 4 and 6 months for most serotypes, as indicated by increased serotype-specific IgG GMCs. The immunogenicity of the 3 PCV21 formulations was comparable to that of PCV13 for most of the shared serotypes but, as expected, was numerically greater for the 8 additional serotypes, for which PCV13 demonstrated limited response. Functional immune responses were consistent with the IgG results in the subset of participants in whom OPA was assessed. The results of this study are consistent with the results of a phase 3 study of the recently approved 20-valent vaccine, Prevnar 20 (Pfizer), administered as a 4-dose series. The increased valency vaccines compared to PCV13, while reaching noninferiority for most of the shared serotypes and maintaining a robust immune response, show a trend for a lower immune response than the reference vaccine (except for serotype 3, for which the PCV21 formulations induced a higher immune response). However, the clinical significance for these new generations of PCV vaccines is unclear and, it is anticipated, based on the PCV13 experience, that protection against the disease caused by these vaccine serotypes is maintained.

### 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) for… [^117Kvrnj]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

About CDC vaccine recommendations are developed using an explicit evidence-based method based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Introduction On June 22, 2023, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended use of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as an option to 15. -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for: routine vaccination of all children aged 2–23 months; catch-up vaccination for healthy children aged 24–59 months who have not received age-appropriate doses; and children aged 24–71 months with certain underlying medical conditions at increased risk for pneumococcal disease* who have not received age-appropriate doses. In addition, recommendations were updated for children aged 2–18 years with any risk conditions.

Indications for risk-based pneumococcal vaccine recommendations were expanded to include children with chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma. A systematic review and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was employed to guide ACIP's deliberations regarding use of this vaccine. conditions.

Intervention PCV20 for all PCV-unvaccinated children Comparison PCV13 or PCV15 according to currently recommended dosing and schedules Outcomes Vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, vaccine-type pneumonia, vaccine-type acute otitis media, vaccine-type pneumococcal deaths, serious adverse events following immunization. This systematic review leveraged strategies used in existing systematic reviews, which captured literature published between January 1994–December 2019 targeting PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 using various dosing schedules in the general pediatric population. Specifically, we utilized:

- Pneumococcal vaccine studies specifically targeting children with underlying medical conditions, which were not captured in the previous literature searches,
- Additional literature on pneumococcal vaccines published since January 2020 to update the previous systematic reviews evaluating PCV13 use in the general pediatric populations.

Search results were supplemented by an updated Pubmed search using "PCV20 or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine" and a search of clinicaltrials. gov using "20-valent pneumococcal", limiting to trials in children aged < 19 years. Unpublished data were provided by the vaccine manufacturer. Characteristics of this study are included in Appendix II. Beneficial and harmful outcomes for the GRADE assessment were selected by the ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group during calls and via an email survey in which Work Group members were asked to rank the relative importance of each outcome. Vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, VT non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, VT acute otitis media, vaccine-type pneumococcal deaths, and serious adverse events following immunization were deemed to be critical outcomes.

Coadministration with Other Vaccines

In accordance with ACIP's General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, routine administration of a pneumococcal vaccine with other age-appropriate doses of vaccines at the same visit is recommended for adults who have no specific contraindications to vaccination at the time of the health care visit.

Contraindications and Precautions

Vaccination providers should consult the vaccine package insert for precautions, warnings, and contraindications. Vaccination with PCV or PPSV23 is contraindicated in persons known to have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine. PCVs are also contraindicated in persons known to have had a severe allergic reaction to any diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine.

### Immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant aged ≥ 2 years: an open-label study [^116nUvNt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This open-label study was conducted at 37 centers in Europe, Canada, and the United States between January 2010 and May 2013. Approximately 3–6 months after HSCT, 3 doses of PCV13 were administered monthly, a fourth dose of PCV13 was administered 6 months later, and a dose of PPSV23 was administered 1 month later. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the responsible institutional review boards and independent ethics committees.

Participants

Eligible participants were patients aged ≥ 2 years with hematologic disorders who had received, 91–203 days before enrollment, an allogeneic HSCT following myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning; had stable engraftment with an absolute neutrophil count > 1000/µL and a platelet count > 50 000/µL; and had complete or (for lymphoma and myeloma) very good partial hematologic remission of underlying disease. Main exclusion criteria included donor lymphocyte infusions within 28 days; plasma products or immunoglobulins within 60 days; rituximab, advanced therapy medicinal products, chemotherapy for relapse of underlying malignancy, or any pneumococcal vaccine other than study vaccines since HSCT. Concomitant treatments and other licensed nonstudy vaccines, which reflect the standard of care at each site, were permitted.

Vaccines and Administration

PCV13 (Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, Wyeth Vaccines, acquired by Pfizer Inc in 2009) contains saccharides from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria cross-reactive material. PPSV23 (Pneumovax 23, Merck & Co, Inc) contains purified capsular polysaccharides from all PCV13 serotypes except 6A, as well as 11 additional serotypes (2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 17F, 20, 22F, and 33F). Vaccines were administered intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 mL.

Immunogenicity Assessment

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations were assessed from blood samples taken immediately before and 1 month after each vaccination using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After study completion, functional antibody titers using opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assays were assessed in any available sera based on previously described methods.

### Polysensitive radiation recall dermatitis following prevnar 20 vaccination [^114K6EeZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior hypotheses to explain how previously irradiated tissue may become susceptible to RRD include vascular damage, increased sensitivity of epithelial stem cells, epithelial stem cell depletion, and FDE-like sensitization. These proposals may account for certain features of RRD, including normal appearance and function of the skin before the triggering agent, agent-specific responses, speed of onset, occasional improvement of cutaneous reactions with agent rechallenge, and occurrence even with noncytotoxic drugs. As in FDE, however, a mechanism by which intramuscular vaccination could induce RRD at distant sites has not been described. In this case, the patient's prior immunization against capsular polysaccharides from the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes shared between Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20 suggests that extant humoral immunity against these antigens may underlie the presentation via antibody-dependent natural killer cell activation or another antibody-dependent pathway.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

CDC and ACIP will continue to assess safety of PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines, monitor the impact of implementation of new recommendations, and assess postimplementation vaccine effectiveness and update pneumococcal vaccination recommendations as appropriate.

Before administering PCV20, PCV15, or PPSV23, health care providers should consult relevant package inserts regarding precautions and contraindications. Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available at.

### Intervals between PCV13 and PPSV23 vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^115Tky3Q]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Two pneumococcal vaccines are currently licensed for use in the United States: the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax 23, Merck and Co, Inc.]). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends that a dose of PCV13 be followed by a dose of PPSV23 in all adults aged ≥ 65 years who have not previously received pneumococcal vaccine and in persons aged ≥ 2 years who are at high risk for pneumococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions (Table) (1–4). The recommended intervals between PCV13 and PPSV23 given in series differ by age and risk group and the order in which the two vaccines are given (1–4).

6	ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse-reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience With Prevnar 13 in Children 6 Weeks Through 17 Years of Age

The safety of Prevnar 13 was evaluated in 13 clinical trials in which 4,729 infants (6 weeks through 11 months of age) and toddlers (12 months through 15 months of age) received at least one dose of Prevnar 13 and 2,760 infants and toddlers received at least one dose of Prevnar active control. Safety data for the first three doses are available for all 13 infant studies; dose 4 data are available for 10 studies; and data for the 6-month follow-up are available for 7 studies. The vaccination schedule and concomitant vaccinations used in these infant trials were consistent with country-specific recommendations and local clinical practice. There were no substantive differences in demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups. By race, 84.0% of subjects were White, 6.0% were Black or African-American, 5.8% were Asian and 3.8% were of 'Other' race (most of these being biracial). Overall, 52.3% of subjects were male infants.

Three studies in the US (Studies 1, 2 and 3)1,2,3evaluated the safety of Prevnar 13 when administered concomitantly with routine US pediatric vaccinations at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months of age. Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were recorded daily by parents/guardians using an electronic diary for 7 consecutive days following each vaccination. For unsolicited adverse events, study subjects were monitored from administration of the first dose until one month after the infant series, and for one month after the administration of the toddler dose. Information regarding unsolicited and serious adverse events, newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, and hospitalizations since the last visit were collected during the clinic visit for the fourth-study dose and during a scripted telephone interview 6 months after the fourth-study dose. Serious adverse events were also collected throughout the study period. Overall, the safety data show a similar proportion of Prevnar 13 and Prevnar subjects reporting serious adverse events. Among US study subjects, a similar proportion of Prevnar 13 and Prevnar recipients reported solicited local and systemic adverse reactions as well as unsolicited adverse events.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112gtwC6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIV primary care — pneumococcal vaccination schedules include PCV20 alone or PCV15 plus 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) given at least 8 weeks later and are now recommended for all individuals aged ≥ 65 years and for those aged between 19 and 64 years with underlying conditions (such as HIV) who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. When PCV20 is used, no additional PPSV23 doses are needed. For those who have received both PCV13 and PPSV23 and are aged < 65 years, a single dose of PCV20 can be administered at least 5 years after the last dose of PPSV23 to complete the series or a second dose of PPSV23 can be administered at least 5 years after the prior dose, with a third and final dose administered at age 65 years or later but at least 5 years after the last PPSV23 dose. For persons aged at least 65 years at the time of a PPSV23 dose, no additional doses are needed. Those who have received only PPSV23 can be given PCV20 with no additional vaccinations or they can be given PCV15 followed by PPSV23 at 8 weeks later; those who have received only PCV13 should receive PCV23 at least 8 weeks later with subsequent PPSV23 doses to complete the series. For those who are aged < 65 years and have received PCV20 or PCV15 with PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later, no additional pneumococcal vaccination is needed at age 65. Shared decision-making is recommended when considering PCV20 for adults aged ≥ 65 years who completed their series with other vaccines; if the decision to administer is made, it should be administered at least 5 years after the last PPSV23 dose. PCV21 (Capavaxie) has also been approved by the FDA and could be substituted for PCV20 in adults for whom a dose of PCV20 is currently recommended.

New Pneumococcal Vaccine Recommendations

Adults aged ≥ 65 years. Adults aged ≥ 65 years who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15). When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23 (Table 1).

Adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors. Adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15). When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.

### Immunogenicity and safety of MMRV and PCV-7 administered concomitantly in healthy children [^1146AjmK]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a combination measles, mump, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV) (ProQuad [Merck & Co, Inc, West Point, PA]) administered to healthy children concomitantly with a pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) (Prevnar [Pfizer, Philadelphia, PA]).

Patients and Methods

Healthy 12- to 15-month-old children who lacked vaccination and clinical histories for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and zoster but had written documentation of receipt of a 3-dose primary series of PCV-7 were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive either the MMRV and PCV-7 (group 1), PCV-7 followed 6 weeks later by MMRV (group 2), or MMRV followed 6 weeks later by PCV-7 (group 3). The primary safety analysis was 56 days (28 days after each visit). Immunogenicity was evaluated 6 weeks after each vaccination.

Results

A total of 1027 children were enrolled (group 1: 510; group 2: 258; group 3: 259). For all 3 groups, the antibody response rate was ≥ 96.8% for measles, mumps, and rubella, ≥ 88.0% for varicella-zoster virus, and ≥ 98.3% for all of the 7 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. The immune responses to all antigens present in MMRV and PCV-7 were similar whether administered concomitantly or sequentially. The incidence of local and systemic adverse experiences (AEs) was comparable between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 combined. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported.

Conclusions

Concomitant administration of the MMRV and PCV-7 is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. Similar immune responses between the groups support concomitant administration of the MMRV and PCV-7 to healthy children 12 to 15 months of age.

Safety and Immunogenicity Studies

Safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 is supported by 6 clinical studies. Study 66evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 in adults 18 through 64 years of age who had not received a previous dose of pneumococcal vaccine. Adults 18 through 59 years of age received a single dose of Prevnar 13, and adults 60 through 64 years of age received a single dose of Prevnar 13 or PPSV23.

Study 7 was randomized and compared the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 with PPSV23 as a single dose in adults ≥ 70 years vaccinated with PPSV23 (≥ 5 years prior to enrollment).7Study 8 was randomized and evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 and PPSV23 in different sequential order in PPSV23 naive adults aged 60 through 64 years8.

One clinical safety study9(Study 9) of Prevnar 13, conducted in PPSV23 previously vaccinated (≥ 3 years prior to enrollment) adults aged ≥ 68 years was a single arm study. Two studies, one in the US10(Study 10) in adults aged 50 through 59 years and the other in Europe11(Study 11) in adults aged ≥ 65 years, evaluated the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with inactivated influenza vaccine, trivalent (Fluarix, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B, Fall 2007/Spring 2008: IIV3) in these two age groups in PPSV23 unvaccinated adults.

Efficacy Study

In Study 1212(subjects 65 years and older), serious adverse events within 1 month of vaccination were reported in 327 of 42,237 (0.8%) Prevnar 13 recipients (352 events) and in 314 of 42,225 (0.7%) placebo recipients (337 events). In the subset of subjects where serious adverse events were monitored for 6 months, 70 of 1,006 (7%) Prevnar 13 vaccinated subjects (90 events) and 60 of 1,005 (6%) placebo vaccinated subjects (69 events) reported serious adverse events.

During the follow-up period (average of 4 years) for case accumulation there were 3,006 deaths (7.1%) in the Prevnar 13 group and 3,005 deaths (7.1%) in the placebo group. There were 10 deaths (< 0.1%) in the Prevnar 13 group and 10 deaths (< 0.1%) in the placebo group within 28 days of vaccination. There were 161 deaths (0.4%) in the Prevnar 13 group and 144 deaths (0.3%) in the placebo group within 29 days – 6 months following vaccination. These data do not provide evidence for a causal relationship between deaths and vaccination with Prevnar 13.

Solicited Adverse Reactions in Adult Clinical Studies

The incidence and severity of solicited adverse reactions that occurred within 7 or 14 days following each dose of Prevnar 13, PPSV23, or placebo administered to adults in 5 studies are shown in Tables 11, 12, 13, and 14.

The commonly reported local adverse reactions after Prevnar 13 vaccination in PPSV23 unvaccinated and PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults were redness, swelling and pain at the injection site, or limitation of arm movement (Tables 11 and 12). The commonly reported systemic adverse reactions in PPSV23 unvaccinated and PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults were fatigue, headache, chills, rash, decreased appetite, or muscle pain and joint pain (Tables 13 and 14).

Safety Results from Adult Clinical Study of Concomitant Administration of Prevnar 13 and IIV4 (Fluzone Quadrivalent) (Study 13)

The safety profile of Prevnar 13 when administered concomitantly with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent, to PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults ≥ 50 years of age was generally consistent with the known safety profile of Prevnar 13.

### Immunogenicity and safety of two tetravalent (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) vaccines coadministered with hepatitis A and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to children twelve to fourteen months of age [^117PFjfn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study compared single-dose tetravalent measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, Priorix-Tetra, stored refrigerated (GSK+4C) or frozen (GSK-20C), with ProQuad (Merck-20C), when coadministered with hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).

Methods

Multicenter, observer-blind phase 2 study in 1783 healthy 12–14 month olds randomized to: GSK+4C (n = 705), GSK-20C (n = 689) or Merck-20C (n = 389), administered concomitantly with HAV (Havrix) and PCV7 (Prevnar). Seroresponse rates and antibody geometric mean concentrations/titers were determined from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assays. Reactogenicity and safety were assessed.

Results

Seroresponse rates (day 42) were > 97% for measles and rubella viruses and > 92% for mumps virus, in all groups. Noninferiority of both GSK+4C and GSK-20C vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for seroresponse rates to measles, mumps and rubella viruses (lower 97.5% confidence interval above -5%, -10% and -5%, respectively). For varicella-zoster virus, seroresponse rates were 57.1%, 69.8% and 86.7% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively. Noninferiority was not shown for either GSK vaccine (lower 97.5% confidence intervals < -15%). Geometric mean concentration ratios for anti-varicella-zoster virus demonstrated noninferiority (lower 97.5% confidence interval ≥ 0.5) versus Merck-20C for GSK-20C only. Geometric mean concentration ratios for antibodies to HAV and to PCV7 pneumococcal serotypes also met criteria for noninferiority for both GSK groups compared with Merck-20C. GSK vaccine safety was observed comparable to Merck-20C. Localized but not generalized measles/rubella-like rash and grade 3 fever was reported slightly more frequently with GSK vaccines, but antipyretic use was similar. The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 serious adverse event was 2.0%, 2.9% and 1.8% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Noninferiority of both GSK measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for responses to measles, mumps and rubella viruses but was not fully demonstrated for varicella-zoster virus. The vaccines showed acceptable reactogenicity/safety when coadministered with HAV and PCV7.

### Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) [^115RmxMB]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

2.1 Preparation for Administration

Since this product is a suspension containing an adjuvant, shake vigorously immediately prior to use to obtain a homogenous, white suspension in the vaccine container. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration [see Description (11)]. This product should not be used if particulate matter or discoloration is found.

Do not mix Prevnar 13 with other vaccines/products in the same syringe.

2.2 Administration Information

For intramuscular injection only.

Each 0.5 mL dose is to be injected intramuscularly using a sterile needle attached to the supplied prefilled syringe. The preferred sites for injection are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants and the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in toddlers, children and adults. The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk and/or blood vessel.

2.3 Vaccination Schedule for Infants and Toddlers

Prevnar 13 is to be administered as a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months of age.

2.4 Vaccination Schedule for Unvaccinated Children 7 Months Through 5 Years of Age

For children 7 months through 5 years of age who have not received Prevnar®or Prevnar 13, the catch-up schedule in Table 2 applies:

The immune responses induced by this catch-up schedule may result in lower antibody concentrations for some serotypes, compared to antibody concentrations following 4 doses of Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months). In children 24 months through 5 years of age, lower antibody concentrations were observed for some serotypes, compared to antibody concentrations following 3 doses of Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, and 6 months).

2.5 Vaccination Schedule for Children 6 Years Through 17 Years of Age

In children 6 years through 17 years of age, Prevnar 13 is administered as single dose. If Prevnar was previously administered, then at least 8 weeks should elapse before receiving Prevnar 13.

2.6 Vaccination Schedule for Adults 18 Years of Age and Older

Prevnar 13 is administered as a single dose.

### Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) [^115chZaX]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Adults ≥ 50 Years of Age

Concomitant Administration with QIV

Prevnar 13 was administered to PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults ≥ 50 years of age concomitantly with a US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4) (Fluzone Quadrivalent) for the 2014/2015 influenza season (Study 13) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. One study group received Prevnar 13 and IIV4 concurrently, followed approximately one month later by placebo. A second study group received IIV4 and placebo concurrently, followed approximately one month later by Prevnar 13.

Serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody responses were measured one month after Prevnar 13 vaccination as OPA GMTs. Noninferiority was demonstrated for each pneumococcal serotype if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Prevnar 13 + IIV4 relative to Prevnar 13 alone) was > 0.5. Although OPA antibody responses to Prevnar 13 generally appeared to be slightly lower when Prevnar 13 was administered concomitantly with IIV4 compared to Prevnar 13 administered alone, noninferiority was demonstrated for all Prevnar 13 pneumococcal serotypes evaluated in Study 13.

Strain-specific influenza antibody responses were measured one month after IIV4 as hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI) titers. HAI GMTs were evaluated for each IIV4 strain in Study 13. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the HAI GMT ratio (Prevnar 13 + IIV4 relative to IIV4 + Placebo) was > 0.5. Noninferiority was demonstrated for each IIV4 vaccine strain evaluated in Study 13.

Concomitant Administration with TIV

Two randomized, double-blind clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 given with IIV3 (Fall 2007/ Spring 2008 Fluarix, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains) in PPSV23 unvaccinated adults aged 50 through 59 years10(Study 10, conducted in the US) and in adults ≥ 65 years11(Study 11, conducted in Europe). Based on analysis of the primary pre-specified comparison of serotype specific anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG GMCs, noninferiority was met for all serotypes in adults 50–59 years of age and for 12 of 13 serotypes in adults ≥ 65years of age.

### Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) in adults 60 to 64 years of age [^113HemvL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this phase 2, randomized study, PCV20 was well tolerated in pneumococcal vaccine-naive adults 60–64 years of age. AE and reactogenicity event profiles were consistent with those observed for PCV13 and historical PCV experience in this age group. PCV20 vaccination elicited robust OPA responses to all vaccine serotypes that were somewhat lower to those elicited by PCV13 and generally higher than those for PPSV23. These data support ongoing phase 3 clinical development in adults and demonstrate the potential for PCV20 to provide expanded protection against pneumococcal disease.

### Immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of concomitant administration of the novavax vaccine against omicron XBB.1.5 (NVX-CoV2601) and a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults aged ≥ 60 years: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial [^1139VMe8]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is conflicting evidence as to whether the combined administration of two vaccines can lead to poorer immunogenicity and reactogenicity. The co-administration of the Omicron-adapted COVID-19 vaccine from Novavax (NVX-CoV2601) and a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) has not been previously investigated.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial, immunocompetent participants aged ≥ 60 years were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to four groups: NVX-CoV2601 plus PCV20 (combination group); NVX-CoV2601 plus placebo (NVX-only group); PCV20 plus placebo (PCV20-only group); or placebo plus placebo (placebo group). The primary outcome was Omicron-specific anti-spike protein IgG ELISA units at day 28 in the combination group compared with the NVX-only group. Non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the geometric mean titre ratio was above the non-inferiority margin of 0.67. Secondary outcomes included anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PCP) IgG ELISA units. Solicited local and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days after vaccination. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05767606, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2022–004118–12.

Results

All 256 randomised participants completed the study. The baseline characteristics were similar in the four groups. Overall, the median age was 64 (IQR 61 to 69) and 105 (41%) of 256 were male. At day 28, the geometric mean anti-spike protein IgG ELISA units were 534 U/mL (95% CI 432–660) in the combination group and 556 U/mL (95% CI 460–672) in the NVX-only group, resulting in a geometric mean titre ratio of 0.96 (95% CI 0.73–1.27), thereby meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. Anti-PCP IgG ELISA units at day 28 were 507 U/mL (95% CI 416–619) in the combination group and 592 U/mL (95% CI 485–723) in the PCV20-only group. Local and systemic reactogenicity was similar in the three active treatment groups. No safety concerns or serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

Immunogenicity following co-administration of NVX-CoV2601 with PCV20 was non-inferior to administration of NVX-CoV2601 alone. Given the similar safety and reactogenicity profile, our findings may help to overcome concerns about concomitant vaccination and pave the way for combination vaccines.

Abstract

Before October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as for those aged 19–64 years with risk conditions for pneumococcal disease who have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme). There are additional recommendations for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on expanding the age-based PCV recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years. On October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs among adults aged 19–49 years with risk conditions and PCV13-vaccinated adults have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides updated clinical guidance for use of PCV.

The response to the additional serotype 6A, which is contained in Prevnar 13 but not in PPSV23, was assessed by demonstration of a ≥ 4-fold increase in the anti-6A mcOPA antibody titer above preimmunization levels. A statistically significantly greater response for Prevnar 13 was defined, for the difference in percentages (Prevnar 13 minus PPSV23) of adults achieving a ≥ 4-fold increase in anti-6A mcOPA antibody titer, as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI greater than zero. For comparison of mcOPA antibody GMTs, a statistically greater response for serotype 6A was defined as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (Prevnar 13/PPSV23) greater than 2.

Of the 6 Phase 3 or Phase 4 clinical trials, 2 noninferiority trials6,7were conducted in which the immune responses to Prevnar 13 were compared with the immune responses to PPSV23; one in PPSV23 unvaccinated adults aged 18 through 64 years6(Study 6), and one in PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults aged ≥ 70 years7(Study 7). A third study compared immune responses to a single dose of Prevnar 13 to the response to Prevnar 13 administered one year after a dose of PPSV23 in adults aged 60 through 64 years who were PPSV23 unvaccinated at enrollment8(Study 8). The study also compared immune responses of PPSV23 as a single dose to the responses to PPSV23 administered one year after a dose of Prevnar 13. Two studies assessed the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with seasonal inactivated Fluarix (IIV3) in the US10(Study 10) and Europe11(Study 11). One study (Study 13) assessed the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with seasonal inactivated Fluzone Quadrivalent (IIV4) in PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults ≥ 50 years of age in the US.

Overall across the clinical studies evaluating the immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 in adults, persons 18 through 64 years of age responded at least as well as persons 65 years and older, the age group evaluated in a clinical endpoint efficacy trial.

### Use of 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among U.S. adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^116svRdF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

On June 17, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) for adults aged ≥ 18 years. PCV21 does not contain certain serotypes that are included in other licensed pneumococcal vaccines but adds eight new serotypes. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends use of a PCV for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as adults aged 19–64 years with certain risk conditions for pneumococcal disease if they have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Previously, options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) alone or a 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC). Additional recommendations for use of PCV20 exist for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on PCV21 vaccination among U.S. adults. On June 27, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV21 as an option for adults aged ≥ 19 years for whom PCV is currently recommended. Indications for PCV have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides clinical guidance for use of PCV21.

Adults Who Received HSCT

Adults who received HSCT are recommended to receive 3 doses of PCV20, 4 weeks apart starting 3–6 months after HSCT. A fourth PCV20 dose is recommended ≥ 6 months after the third dose of PCV20 or ≥ 12 months after HSCT, whichever is later. HSCT recipients who have started their pneumococcal vaccine series with PCV13 or PCV15 can complete their 4-dose pneumococcal vaccine series with PCV20 without receiving extra doses. If PCV20 is not available, 3 doses of PCV15 followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 ≥ 12 months after HSCT can be administered. For patients with chronic GVHD who are receiving PCV15, a fourth dose of PCV15 can be administered in place of PPSV23 because these adults are less likely to respond to PPSV23. A patient's clinical team is best informed to determine the appropriate timing of vaccination (Table 6).

Rationale

HCST recipients have a poor response to PPSV23 when it is administered during the first year after transplantation or later, especially those with chronic GVHD. Although no clinical trial data are available on PCV20 use among HSCT recipients, studies that assessed the use of 4 doses of PCV13 (3 doses and 1 booster dose) followed by 1 dose of PPSV23 demonstrated that use of 4 doses of PCV13 is immunogenic, and PCV20 provides the broadest serotype coverage among available PCVs. Phase III clinical trial data indicated that the immunogenicity of PCV15 was comparable with that of PCV13 when used either with a dose of PPSV23 (in those without GVHD) or PCV (in those with GVHD) as the fourth dose. The frequency of vaccine-related adverse events was higher after use of 3 doses of PCV15, although the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate.

Coadministration With Other Vaccines

In accordance with ACIP's General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, routine administration of a pneumococcal vaccine with other age-appropriate doses of vaccines at the same visit is recommended for adults who have no specific contraindications at the time of the health care visit. For example, coadministration with a COVID-19 vaccine can be administered at a different anatomic site during the same visit. More information on coadministration of COVID-19 vaccine is detailed in the Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United States.

Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD)

Prevnar (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM'197Protein]) was licensed in the US for infants and children in 2000, following a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in a multiethnic population at Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) from October 1995 through August 20, 1998, in which 37,816 infants were randomized to receive either Prevnar or a control vaccine (an investigational meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine [MnCC]) at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months of age. In this study, the efficacy of Prevnar against invasive disease due to S. pneumoniae in cases accrued during this period was 100% in both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses (95% confidence interval [CI]: 75.4%, 100% and 81.7%, 100%, respectively). Data accumulated through an extended follow-up period to April 20, 1999, resulted in similar efficacy estimates of 97.4% in the per-protocol analysis and 93.9% in the intent-to-treat analysis (95% CI: 82.7%, 99.9% and 79.6%, 98.5%, respectively).

### Concomitant administration of pneumococcal-23 and zoster vaccines provides adequate herpes zoster coverage [^114BHjEr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether concomitant administration of zoster vaccine and polysaccharide pneumococcal-23 vaccine (PPV23) provides sufficient protection against herpes zoster infections.

Data Sources

Literature was retrieved through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, PubMed (inception-February 2013), and Scopus (inception-February 2013) using the key words herpes zoster, pneumococcal, vaccine, concomitant, simultaneous administration, Pneumovax, Zostavax, and barriers. In addition, reference citations from publications were used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. Two studies evaluating concomitant and nonconcomitant administration of zoster vaccine and PPV23 were included.

Data Synthesis

Current product labeling recommends a 4-week interval between zoster vaccine and PPV23 administration; however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC promote concomitant administration to prevent a missed opportunity to vaccinate. This has caused confusion among health care professionals regarding the appropriate timing of these vaccines. A randomized trial that evaluated the immunogenicity of zoster vaccine and PPV23 given together versus separated by at least 4 weeks demonstrated that the varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody levels of concomitant versus nonconcomitant vaccination groups did not meet noninferiority requirements. However, a large retrospective cohort trial that compared the incidence of herpes zoster infections following concomitant versus nonconcomitant administration of PPV23 and zoster vaccine did not find a statistically significant between-group difference.

Conclusions

Concomitant administration of zoster vaccine and PPV23 is advocated by the CDC and FDA to improve immunization rates among vaccine-eligible individuals. Since there is no direct evidence that simultaneous administration of zoster vaccine and PPV23 puts patients at increased risk of developing herpes zoster, the vaccines should be given during the same office visit to avoid a missed opportunity to vaccinate against 2 serious diseases.

RESULTS

Participants

Overall, 1997 participants were randomized and 1991 were vaccinated (PCV20, n = 1001; PCV13, n = 990), with 93.1% (n = 1860) and 85.0% (n = 1697) completing 3 doses and 4 doses, respectively (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3). Demographic characteristics of participants were generally similar in the 2 groups (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4). Approximately 25% of the study population was nonwhite and about 30% were Hispanic/Latino. Median (range) age was 64 (42–97) days at dose 1 and 372 (365–460) days at dose 4.

Rotavirus vaccines were the most common nonstudy vaccines coadministered with study vaccines at dose 1 (87.4%), dose 2 (84.4%) and dose 3 (65.4%); approximately 10% of participants received influenza vaccines each at doses 3 and 4.

### Updated recommendation from the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) for use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in children aged 24–59 months who are not completely vaccinated [^117EAMJd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

This notice updates the recommendation for use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) among children aged 24–59 months who are either unvaccinated or who have a lapse in PCV7 administration. In February 2000, PCV7, marketed as Prevnar and manufactured by Wyeth Vaccines (Collegeville, Pennsylvania), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in infants and young children. At that time, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that children aged 24–59 months who have certain underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised receive PCV7. In addition, ACIP recommended that PCV7 be considered for all other children aged 24–59 months, with priority given to those who are American Indian/Alaska Native or of African-American descent, and to children who attend group day care centers. The recommendation also provided schedules for administering PCV7 to children aged 24–59 months who were either unvaccinated or who had a lapse in PCV7 administration; these schedules included 1) 1 dose of PCV7 for healthy children, and 2) 2 doses of PCV7 ≥ 2 months apart for children with certain chronic diseases or immunosuppressive conditions.

Simultaneous Administration with Other Vaccines

Available data do not indicate a reduced response when HepA vaccine is administered with other vaccines among children and adults (,–); additional information is available from the manufacturer package inserts. Limited data from studies conducted among adults indicate that simultaneous administration of HepA vaccine with diphtheria, poliovirus (oral and inactivated), tetanus, typhoid (both oral and intramuscular), cholera, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, or yellow fever vaccines does not decrease the immune response to either vaccine or increase the frequency of adverse events. Studies conducted before the licensure of Twinrix in the United States indicated that HepB vaccine can be administered simultaneously with HepA vaccine without either decreasing vaccine immunogenicity or increasing the frequency of adverse events.

Studies conducted among infants and young children aged < 18 months have demonstrated that simultaneous administration of HepA vaccine with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), HepB, MMR, or inactivated poliovirus vaccines does not affect the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of these vaccines. Administration of 1 or 2 doses of Vaqta was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in approximately 4,300 children aged 12–23 months, whether given alone or concomitantly with other vaccines (M-M-RII, Varivax, Tripedia, Prevnar, ProQuad, PedvaxHIB, and Infanrix) in the United States.

Regarding preventative measures for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pneumococcal vaccination, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15) ≥ 1 year after the last PPSV23 dose in adults aged ≥ 19 years received only PPSV23. Offer another dose of PPSV23 when PCV15 is administered in adults with a history of PPSV23 receipt.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among children aged 6–18 years with immunocompromising conditions: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111ijwfG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

On February 20, 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.) for children aged 6–18 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or cochlear implants who have not previously received PCV13. PCV13 should be administered to these children regardless of whether they received the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) or the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Recommendations for PPSV23 use for children in this age group remain unchanged. The evidence for the benefits and risks associated with PCV13 vaccination of children with immunocompromising conditions was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. This recommendation reflects a policy change from permissive and off-label recommendation of PCV13 in the pediatric immunocompromised population to a category A recommendation. This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation and reviews the recommendations for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 for children aged 6–18 years.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

### Safety and immunogenicity of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers and infants [^115Bgzv3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

It is well established in the immunization programs that pneumococcal vaccines are administered concomitantly with other routine pediatric vaccines. Previous data generated with co-administration of vaccines containing protein conjugates and the same vaccine antigens suggested that there might be an interaction between these components and the immune response may be altered. However, in this study, the antibody responses to coadministered pediatric vaccines were comparable in the PCV21 groups and the PCV13 group in both cohorts. This is similar to previous studies of PCV15 or PCV20 in infants and toddlers that also found that responses to concomitantly administered pediatric vaccines were comparable to those with PCV13. – The results show positive effects of the tetanus toxoid as a carrier protein on the immune response to this antigen component as well as to Hib. This confirms that PCV21 can be given concomitantly with other pediatric vaccines without clinical interference with the expected safety or immunogenicity profiles of these vaccines. The serotypes conjugated to tetanus toxoid displayed a robust immune response and therefore were not indicative of carrier-induced epitopic suppression. Increased antigen content for selected serotypes in the PCV21 #2 and PCV21 #3 formulations compared with the PCV21 #1 formulation and PCV13 was associated with increased immunogenicity for these serotypes. Based on this finding and the comparable safety profiles of the 3 formulations, PCV21 #3, which has increased antigen content (4.4 μg instead of 2.2 μg) for serotypes 3, 4, 6B, 9V, 19A and 19F, has been selected for evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers and infants [^111e7Eyn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumococcal disease, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a significant global health threat, particularly among children under the age of 5 years. Although the majority of S. pneumoniae infections cause noninvasive disease (eg, acute otitis media, sinusitis and nonbacteremic pneumonia), they can also cause potentially life-threatening invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including bacteremic pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. Globally, there were an estimated 294,000 deaths caused by S. pneumoniae infections in children < 5 years old without HIV infection in 2015, corresponding to a mortality rate of 45 per 100,000.

There are at least 100 known serotypes of S. pneumoniae; however, the majority of infections involve only a small number of these. The use of multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covering common IPD-causing serotypes has reduced the burden of disease caused by vaccine serotypes in children. However, over time, there have been increasing proportions of S. pneumoniae infections caused by nonvaccine serotypes, – necessitating the development of vaccines containing additional serotypes.

A 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Pfizer, Philadelphia, PA) was introduced in late 2009 and remains widely used in children < 5 years of age, being recommended in current guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO). More recently, 15-valent and 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, PCV15 (VAXNEUVANCE, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Rahway, NJ) and PCV20 (Prevnar20 or Prevenar20, Pfizer), respectively, have been approved for pediatric vaccination. –

To provide protection against emerging serotypes in addition to current vaccine serotypes, a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV21, is undergoing clinical development for the prevention of invasive and noninvasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae in the pediatric population (≤ 17 years of age). In addition to the serotypes shared with PCV13, PCV21 contains 8 serotypes identified as having increased prevalence in North America and Europe.– PCV21 also differs from PCV13 in that 4 serotypes are conjugated to a tetanus toxoid carrier protein; the remaining 17 serotypes are conjugated to the cross-reacting material-197 diphtheria carrier protein also present in PCV13, PCV15 and PCV20.

Here, we report the results of a phase 2 study (: NCT04398706) evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of PCV21, compared with PCV13, administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccinations in healthy toddlers and infants.

### Should the new pneumococcal vaccine be used in high-risk children? [^112GUFHF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

A new conjugate 7-valent vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infection (Prevenar, Wyeth) has recently received a European licence for use in young healthy children. The vaccine is not currently included in the universal immunisation schedule in the UK or elsewhere in Europe, although it is being used widely in the USA. Its availability for purchase raises the question whether paediatricians should consider using it in high risk children, including those for whom the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine was previously recommended, until (or unless) it is introduced into general use-indeed the Chief Medical Officer for England and Wales has recently made a recommendation regarding such children aged less than 2 years. We review the evidence concerning use of the vaccine in such children and make suggestions as to how the vaccine may be used while further information is collected.

Vaccines and administration

V114 is a 15-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F, 22F, and 33F, all conjugated to CRM 197 carrier protein and adjuvanted with 125 μg aluminum phosphate. PCV13 (Prevnar 13; Wyeth LLC, marketed by Pfizer, New York, New York, USA) is a 13-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, all conjugated to CRM 197 carrier protein and adjuvanted with 125 μg aluminum phosphate. PPSV23 (PNEUMOVAX23; Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. Rahway, New Jersey, USA) is an unadjuvanted 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Each dose contains 25 μg of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F.

V114 and PCV13 were supplied as sterile suspensions and PPSV23 was supplied as a sterile solution. All vaccines were supplied in prefilled syringes and stored at 2–8°C. They were all administered intramuscularly as 0.5 mL doses.

### Immunogenicity and safety of measles-mumps-rubella, varicella and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines administered concurrently with a fourth dose of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared with the vaccines administered without heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [^117N17BT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Prevnar [heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7)] is licensed in the United States for routine administration in infants and may be coadministered with other infant vaccines. Safety and immunogenicity data on the coadministration of the fourth dose of PCV7 with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines are limited.

Methods

Children 12–15 months of age received either MMR with PCV7 (group 1) or MMR without PCV7 (group 2). All subjects received Hib and varicella vaccines. Group 2 received PCV7 6–9 weeks after MMR vaccination. Sera for analysis of all non-PCV7 antibodies were collected just before administration of MMR vaccine and 6 weeks later. Optimal antigen responses were assessed with the use of predetermined antibody titers. The primary end point was > 90% response rate (all antigens). Noninferiority was defined as < 10% difference between groups. Local and systemic reactions and postvaccination adverse events were monitored and compared between groups.

Results

A total of 694 subjects (347 per group) were enrolled. After immunization with MMR plus PCV7 concurrently, or MMR followed 6 weeks later by PCV7, the percentages of subjects seroconverting were significantly greater than 90% for all antigens. The difference between the 2 groups was significantly less than 10%.

Conclusion

The immune response to MMR, Hib and varicella vaccines, when administered concurrently with a 4th (booster) dose of PCV7, was noninferior to that of these vaccines when given without PCV7. These results support concomitant administration of PCV7 with MMR, varicella and Hib as part of the recommended immunization schedule for children 12–15 months of age.

### Licensure of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults aged 50 years and older [^113LsvvJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

In 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.]) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for children aged 6 weeks through 71 months for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. PCV13 currently is recommended as a 4-dose series for children starting at age 2 months. On December 30, 2011, FDA approved PCV13 for prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by PCV13 serotypes among adults aged 50 years and older. This report summarizes data on the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 in adults and outlines key additional evidence requested by ACIP to formulate recommendations for its use.

Clinical Trials Conducted in PPSV23 Previously Vaccinated Adults

In a Phase 3 active-controlled, modified double-blind clinical trial7(Study 7) of Prevnar 13 in the US and Sweden, PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults aged ≥ 70 years who had received one dose of PPSV23 ≥ 5 years prior were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either Prevnar 13 or PPSV23.

The mcOPA antibody GMTs elicited by Prevnar 13 were noninferior to those elicited by PPSV23 for the 12 serotypes in common, when Prevnar 13 or PPSV23 were administered at a minimum of 5 years after a prior dose of PPSV23. In addition, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the mcOPA antibody GMT ratio (Prevnar 13/PPSV23) was greater than 1 for 9 of the serotypes in common.

For serotype 6A, which is unique to Prevnar 13, the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 4-fold increase in mcOPA antibody titers after Prevnar 13 (71.1%) was statistically significantly greater than after PPSV23 (27.3%) in PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults aged ≥ 70 years. mcOPA antibody GMTs for serotype 6A were statistically significantly greater after Prevnar 13 compared with after PPSV23.

This clinical trial demonstrated that in adults aged ≥ 70 years and previously vaccinated with PPSV23 ≥ 5 years prior, vaccination with Prevnar 13 elicited noninferior immune responses as compared with re-vaccination with PPSV23 (see Table 26).

### Pneumococcal vaccine for adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2023 [^115ruQre]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumococcal Vaccines and Administration

One PPSV and three PCVs are licensed and available for use in the United States (Table 1). These vaccines are PPSV23 (Pneumovax23), a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; PCV13 (Prevnar13), a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PCV15 (Vaxneuvance), 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; and PCV20 (Prevnar20), a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The PPSV and PCV vaccines induce immune responses in different ways. Studies in mice have found that the polysaccharide vaccine induces a T-cell independent immune response and stimulates immediate B-cell responses. As a result, B-cells differentiate to plasma cells that produce antibodies. However, a T-cell independent immune response does not result in creation of serotype-specific memory B-cells. On the other hand, conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell dependent response. The polysaccharide antigen binds to the B-cells, and the peptides from the carrier protein are presented to carrier-peptide–specific helper T-cells. These helper T-cells enhance the immune response by the B-cells, and memory B-cells also are created. All PCVs use CRM197 (genetically detoxified diphtheria toxin) as a carrier protein.

### Lot-to-lot consistency, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational hexavalent vaccine in US infants [^114DTQW4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This multicenter phase III study (NCT01340937) evaluated the consistency of immune responses to 3 separate lots of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis 5, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B (DTaP5-IPV-Hib-HepB), an investigational hexavalent vaccine (HV).

Methods

Healthy infants were randomized (2:2:2:1) to receive HV or Pentacel (Control). Groups 1, 2 and 3 received HV at 2, 4 and 6 months, and Control at 15 months. Group 4 received Control at 2, 4, 6 and 15 months, plus Recombivax HB (HepB) at 2 and 6 months. Concomitant Prevnar 13 was given to all groups at 2, 4, 6 and 15 months; pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) was given to all groups at 2, 4 and 6 months. Blood specimens (3–5mL) were collected immediately before administration of dose 1, postdose 3, immediately before toddler dose, and after toddler dose. Adverse events were recorded after each vaccination.

Results

The 3 manufacturing lots of HV induced consistent antibody responses to all antigens. Immunogenicity of HV was noninferior to Control for all antibodies, except for pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin geometric mean concentration postdose 3, and pertussis pertactin (PRN) geometric mean concentration after toddler dose. Postdose 3 immunogenicity of concomitantly administered Prevnar 13 was generally similar (except for serotype 6B) when given with HV or Control. Adverse events of HV were similar to Control, except for a higher rate of fever ≥ 38.0°C [49.2% vs. 35.4%, estimated difference 13.7% (8.4, 18.8)].

Conclusions

HV demonstrated lot-to-lot manufacturing consistency; safety and immunogenicity were comparable with the licensed vaccines. HV provides a new combination vaccine option within the US 2-month, 4-month and 6-month vaccine series.

### Safety and immunogenicity of V114, a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in adults living with HIV [^112KQqLs]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaccines and administration

V114 (VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA) is a 15-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F, 22F, and 33F adjuvanted with aluminium phosphate. PCV13 (Prevnar 13; Wyeth LLC, marketed by Pfizer, New York, New York, USA) is a 13-valent PCV containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F adjuvanted with aluminium phosphate. PPSV23 (PNEUMOVAX23; Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA) is an unadjuvanted 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine containing capsular polysaccharide from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F.

All vaccines were supplied in prefilled syringes and stored at 2–8 °C. They were all administered intramuscularly as 0.5 mL doses.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers and infants [^111vhk3b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study were its randomized design, use of an active comparator control and the concomitant administration of pediatric vaccines that are coadministered with pneumococcal vaccines in routine clinical practice. Limitations include that it was a descriptive study and not designed for formal hypothesis testing, and in cohort 2, OPA titers were measured in only a subset of participants. This study was initiated before the approval of PCV15 and PCV20 for use in infants and toddlers; therefore, the active control was PCV13, which provides coverage against fewer serotypes than these newer vaccines. Phase 3 studies will be required to confirm immunogenicity and safety. The clinical trial program for PCV21 includes 4 ongoing phase 3 studies (registration: NCT06736041; NCT06824181; NCT06824194; NCT06838000) comparing PCV21 with the licensed 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar 20). These studies are enrolling infants 2 months of age (between 42 and 89 days of age on the day of enrollment; NCT06736041, NCT06824181 and NCT06824194) or infants from 7–11 months of age, toddlers from 12–23 months of age and children and adolescents from 2–5 years and 6–17 years of age (NCT06838000). Infants 2 months of age will receive a 4-dose series of PCV21 or PCV20 (NCT06736041 and NCT06824194) or a 4-dose series including 1, 2 or 3 doses of PCV21 after PCV20 or 4 doses of PCV20 (NCT06824181); in these studies, PCV21 and PCV21 are coadministered with routine pediatric vaccines. Participants in the fourth study (NCT06838000) will receive 1, 2 or 3 doses of PCV21 or PCV20, depending on the age group at enrollment.

### Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) [^1132DdhL]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Infants and Toddlers

The concomitant administration of routine US infant vaccines [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] with Prevnar 13 was evaluated in two studies: Study 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], Pneumococcal Immune Responses Following Three Doses2, and the US lot consistency study3(Study 3). In Study 3, subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of 3 lots of Prevnar 13 or Prevnar in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. The total number of infants vaccinated was 6632(Study 2) and 16993(Study 3). Immune responses to concomitant vaccine antigens were compared in infants receiving Prevnar and Prevnar 13. Responses to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis, polio types 1, 2, and 3, hepatitis B, PRP-T, PRP-OMP, measles, and varicella antigens in Prevnar 13 recipients were similar to those in Prevnar recipients. Based on limited data, responses to mumps and rubella antigens in Prevnar 13 recipients were similar to those in Prevnar recipients.

### Expanded recommendations for use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among adults aged ≥ 50 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^111fyNFo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Before October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as for those aged 19–64 years with risk conditions for pneumococcal disease who have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme). There are additional recommendations for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on expanding the age-based PCV recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years. On October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs among adults aged 19–49 years with risk conditions and PCV13-vaccinated adults have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides updated clinical guidance for use of PCV.

PPSV23 Use in PCV13-Experienced Adults Who Have Not Completed the Recommended Vaccination Series

Among adults aged ≥ 19 years who have started their pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13 but have not received all recommended doses, PPSV23 is no longer recommended as an option to complete the series. Either PCV20 or PCV21 is recommended to complete the series as previously recommended. (Table).

Coadministration with Other Vaccines

In accordance with CDC's General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, routine administration of a pneumococcal vaccine with other age-appropriate doses of vaccines at the same visit is recommended for adults who have no specific contraindications to vaccination at the time of the health care visit.

Contraindications and Precautions

Vaccination providers should consult the vaccine package insert for precautions, warnings, and contraindications. Vaccination with PCV or PPSV23 is contraindicated in persons known to have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine. Because PCVs are conjugated to CRM197, a nontoxic genetically altered diphtheria toxin, these vaccines are also contraindicated in persons known to have had a severe allergic reaction to any diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine.

Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events

Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to VAERS. Instructions for reporting to VAERS are available ator by calling 800–822–7967.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

CDC and ACIP will continue to assess safety and public health impact of pneumococcal vaccines among adults. This includes monitoring the duration of vaccine-conferred immunity from PCV to determine the need for a booster to ensure that older adults continue to be protected under the updated vaccine recommendation and to measure any indirect effects on incidence in adults from routine childhood vaccination.

Immunogenicity Among Adults With Previous Pneumococcal Vaccination

Two phase III studies assessed the immunogenicity of PCV20 among adults aged ≥ 65 years who had previous pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13 only, PPSV23 only, or both PCV13 and PPSV23). These studies included adults with stable medical conditions, but not adults with immunocompromising conditions. Immunogenicity to PCV20 was assessed 1 month after receipt of PCV20. In one study, participants either received PCV13 ≥ 6 months previously; PPSV23 1–5 years previously; or PCV13 followed by PPSV23, with PPSV23 ≥ 1 year previously. The other study was a post hoc analysis of a subset of participants who received pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23, or both) ≥ 6 months previously in a phase III clinical trial of the coadministration of PCV20 with a seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. Neither study directly compared the immunogenicity of PCV20 with PPSV23 after receipt of both PCV13 and PPSV23. Compared with persons who previously received PPSV23 only, those who previously received both PCV13 and PPSV23 had numerically higher OPA GMTs of serotypes included in PCV20 in 19 of 20 PCV20 serotypes in one study and for 15 of 20 PCV20 serotypes in another study. In addition, those who received PCV13 only had numerically higher OPA GMTs of serotypes included in PCV20 compared with adults who previously received PPSV23. Percent seroresponders (defined as a greater than fourfold rise in OPA titer from before to 1 month after PCV20 receipt) was numerically higher for 13–18 of 20 serotypes among adults who previously received PCV13 compared with adults who previously received PPSV23. Compared with adults who previously received PPSV23 only, percent seroresponders were numerically higher for four of 20 serotypes for adults who received both PCV13 and PPSV23 in one study and for six of 20 serotypes in another study. Percent seroresponders in these studies typically were lower compared with those observed among pneumococcal vaccine–naïve adults. Regardless, these data demonstrate that PCV20 is immunogenic in those aged ≥ 65 years who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine.

### A phase III randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of an investigational hexavalent vaccine given at two, three, four and twelve months [^11491QDv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Combination vaccines simplify vaccination visits and improve coverage and timeliness. Diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis 5, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib) is a new investigational, fully liquid, combination vaccine containing a 5-antigen pertussis component and is designed to protect against 6 infectious diseases.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, comparator-controlled, phase III study (NCT01341639) conducted in Finland, Germany and Belgium, healthy infants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 immunization regimens. The DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib group received the investigational hexavalent vaccine (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) and the Control group received Infanrix-hexa (DTPa3-HBV-IPV/Hib) at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age. Both groups received concomitantly Prevnar 13 (PCV13) and Rotateq (RV5) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and ProqQad (MMRV) at 12 months of age. MMRV was also administered to all study subjects at 13 months of age.

Results

A total of 628 subjects in the DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib group and 622 subjects in the Control group were randomized. In a per-protocol analysis, immune responses to vaccine antigens 1 month after dose 3 and after the toddler dose were noninferior in the DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib group as compared with the Control group. The DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib group responses to MMRV given concomitantly at 12 months were all noninferior compared with the Control group. Solicited adverse event rates after any dose, including fever, were similar in both groups. Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate and did not lead to subject withdrawal. Vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred infrequently in the DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib group (0.3%) and the Control group (0.2%).

Conclusions

The safety and immunogenicity of DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib is comparable to Control when administered in the 2-month, 3-month, 4-month and 12-month schedule. DTaP5-HB-IPV-Hib has the potential to provide a new hexavalent option for pediatric combination vaccines, aligned with recommended immunizations in Europe.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among children aged 6–18 years with immunocompromising conditions: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1144n7HG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

On February 20, 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.) for children aged 6–18 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or cochlear implants who have not previously received PCV13. PCV13 should be administered to these children regardless of whether they received the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) or the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Recommendations for PPSV23 use for children in this age group remain unchanged. The evidence for the benefits and risks associated with PCV13 vaccination of children with immunocompromising conditions was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. This recommendation reflects a policy change from permissive and off-label recommendation of PCV13 in the pediatric immunocompromised population to a category A recommendation. This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation and reviews the recommendations for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 for children aged 6–18 years.

Key points
- There are 4 pneumococcal vaccines available in the United States.
- Three are conjugate vaccines and 1 is a polysaccharide vaccine.
- Pneumococcal vaccines vary in how well they work and what serotypes, or strains, they protect against.
- Talk to a vaccine provider if you have questions about pneumococcal vaccines. Available vaccines In the United States, there are 2 types of vaccines recommended to help prevent pneumococcal disease:

- Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines
- PCV15
- PCV20
- PCV21
- PCV15
- Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
- PPSV23
- PPSV23 Each of these vaccines helps protect against specific serotypes, or strains, of pneumococcal bacteria. The number at the end of the vaccine name tells how many serotypes the vaccine includes. PCVs PCVs are given to children younger than 5 years old and to older children who need it. Vaccine providers also give PCVs to adults 65 years or older and other adults who need it.

Vaxneuvance TM helps protect against 15 types of pneumococcal bacteria. Prevnar 20 helps protect against 20 types of pneumococcal bacteria. ® CAPVAXIVE TM helps protect against 21 types of pneumococcal bacteria. PPSV23 Vaccine providers may give PPSV23 to children 2 through 18 years old with certain conditions. Vaccine providers give it to adults who receive PCV15. They also may give it to adults who have received an earlier vaccine called PCV13. Pneumovax23 helps protect against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. ®. How well they work Vaccines that help protect against pneumococcal disease work well but cannot prevent all cases. PCVs Pneumococcal disease rates have decreased dramatically since the United States began using PCVs. PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 are new vaccines, so there are no data on how well these vaccines work in real-world conditions.

They were approved based on clinical trial data comparing their safety and immune responses to earlier vaccines. In children Studies show that getting PCV13 prevented invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes:

- For 4 in 5 healthy children
- For 4 in 5 children with certain risk conditions PCV13 also prevented antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections caused by vaccine serotypes. In adults For adults 65 years or older, one study found getting PCV13 protected
- 3 in 4 people against invasive pneumococcal disease
- 9 in 20 people against pneumococcal pneumonia. PPSV23 Studies show PPSV23 protects between 6 to 7 in 10 adults with healthy immune systems from invasive pneumococcal disease. This protection is against pneumococcal infections caused by serotypes in the vaccine.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116PTYAu]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

On August 13, 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) among adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 should be administered in series with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax23, Merck & Co, Inc.]), the vaccine currently recommended for adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2011 for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of PCV13 for preventing community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years with no prior pneumococcal vaccination history (CAPiTA trial) became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new recommendations for PCV13 use, provides guidance for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation.

### Use of 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among U.S. adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^117LkzgJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

On June 17, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) for adults aged ≥ 18 years. PCV21 does not contain certain serotypes that are included in other licensed pneumococcal vaccines but adds eight new serotypes. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends use of a PCV for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as adults aged 19–64 years with certain risk conditions for pneumococcal disease if they have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Previously, options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) alone or a 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC). Additional recommendations for use of PCV20 exist for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on PCV21 vaccination among U.S. adults. On June 27, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV21 as an option for adults aged ≥ 19 years for whom PCV is currently recommended. Indications for PCV have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides clinical guidance for use of PCV21.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to timing and intervals, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to offer PCV15 or PCV20 in adults received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23. Complete the previously recommended PPSV23 series in these adults.

PCV20 safety. Safety of PCV20 was assessed in six trials among immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 18 years that included a total of 4,552 participants who received PCV20. Participants included those who were naïve to pneumococcal vaccination and those who had previously received pneumococcal vaccination. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site pain, muscle pain, fatigue, headache, and joint pain. SAEs reported within 6 months after vaccination occurred among 1.5% of PCV20 recipients and 1.8% among controls. No SAEs or deaths were considered to be related to study vaccines.

Intervals between PCV and PPSV23. Findings from eight immunogenicity studies that evaluated the immune response after a sequence of 7-valent PCV, PCV13, or PCV15 followed by PPSV23 administered at intervals of 2, 6, or 12 months or 3–4 years were reviewed Three studies comparing intervals ranging from 2 to 6 months between administration of PCV and PPSV23 found no significant difference in immunogenicity measured after PPSV23 receipt, although reactogenicity tended to be higher with shorter intervals. In a study that compared antibody responses to 1 dose of PCV13 with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 1 year apart, the immune responses following PPSV23 were significantly lower compared with the responses after a dose of PCV13 for eight of 12 common serotypes. In another study that compared antibody response to 1 dose of PCV13 with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 approximately 4 years apart, the immune responses following PPSV23 were significantly higher for seven of 12 common serotypes. These findings suggested that longer intervals between administration of PCV and PPSV23 might improve immunogenicity in immunocompetent adults, although a direct comparison between a 1- versus 4-year interval was not made.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants in the United States [^117Q9Tpo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumococcal disease (PD), caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, remains a substantial global public health threat that disproportionately affects children younger than 5 years. PD can manifest as noninvasive disease, such as acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, nonbacteremic pneumonia or invasive PD (IPD), including bacteremic pneumonia, meningitis or septicemia. More than 95 pneumococcal serotypes have been identified, each characterized by a unique polysaccharide capsule; however, the majority of disease is caused by a limited serotype subset.

Development and widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in pediatric vaccination programs substantially decreased the global burden of disease, with deaths in children ≤ 5 years of age estimated to have decreased by > 50% from 2000 to 2015. In the United States, the 7-valent PCV (PCV7; Prevnar 7; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), which included capsular polysaccharide conjugates from serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, was introduced in 2000 and led to a 76% reduction in IPD among children < 5 years of age. IPD caused by certain non-PCV7 serotypes increased in incidence after PCV7 introduction. The 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar 13; Pfizer Inc) was introduced in 2010 to cover PCV7 capsular polysaccharide conjugates and 6 additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A). The introduction of PCV7, followed by PCV13, led to a 93% decrease in overall IPD among children < 5 years of age from 1998 to 2018and substantially affected IPD among unvaccinated populations through the herd effect. Both vaccines have also been associated with significant reductions in AOM and pneumonia. –

Safety End Points

Safety end points were analyzed in the safety population for each cohort, which included all participants in that age group who received ≥ 1 vaccine dose with safety follow-up. PCV13 was the main control for safety assessments in all cohorts, although control participants aged ≥ 60 years also received PPSV23 1 month after PCV13.

In 2021, 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (PCV20) (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.) and 15-valent PCV (PCV15) (Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.) were licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for adults aged ≥ 18 years, based on studies that compared antibody responses to PCV20 and PCV15 with those to 13-valent PCV (PCV13) (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.). Antibody responses to two additional serotypes included in PCV15 were compared to corresponding responses after PCV13 vaccination, and antibody responses to seven additional serotypes included in PCV20 were compared with those to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) (Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.). On October 20, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of either PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, and for adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors * who have not previously received a PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown. ACIP employed the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) framework, † using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) § approach to guide its deliberations regarding use of these vaccines. Before this, PCV13 and PPSV23 were recommended for use for U.S. adults and the recommendations varied by age and risk groups. This was simplified in the new recommendations.

Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines

IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine is administered.

Current guidance concerning administration of current U.S.-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines indicates that these vaccines may be given with influenza vaccines. Providers should be aware of the potential for increased reactogenicity with coadministration and should consult updated CDC guidance as more information becomes available. If administered simultaneously, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g. aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) compared with administration of either vaccine alone among 296 persons aged ≥ 65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days postvaccination was similar between the coadministration group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and coadministration groups.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

This was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 2-arm parallel design conducted in the United States from April 2018 to February 2020 (NCT03512288). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive PCV20 or PCV13 at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age (Doses 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). A diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B and inactivated poliovirus combination vaccines [Pediarix (DTaP-HepB-IPV); GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom] were administered concomitantly with the first 3 doses of PCV20 or PCV13. Other permitted vaccines included Haemophilus influenzae type B and rotavirus vaccines with the first 3 doses and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with Dose 4. Influenza vaccine could also be given with study vaccine in age-eligible participants during influenza season.

Eligible infants were healthy, born at > 36 weeks gestation, 42–98 days of age at consent, expected to be available for the study duration and had a legal representative willing and able to comply with study procedures, including telephone contact. Key exclusion criteria included previous receipt of a pneumococcal vaccine; contraindication to vaccination with PCV13, diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis vaccines; history of IPD; neurologic disorder, history of seizure or other medical/psychiatric condition and known or suspected immunodeficiency or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy.

For each vaccination, participants received a single 0.5-mL intramuscular dose of PCV20 or PCV13 into the left anterolateral thigh. The PCV20 dose included capsular polysaccharides of all 20 pneumococcal serotypes (2.2 µg of each, except 4.4 µg of 6B) each individually conjugated to CRM 197. The PCV13 supply was representative of licensed PCV13.

The study was conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the institutional review board and/or independent ethics committee for each participating site. Written informed consent was required from each participant's legal representative before participation in study procedures.

The total safety population in the 6 safety and immunogenicity studies was 7,097. In 5 of the 6 safety and immunogenicity studies, more females than males were enrolled (50.2% – 61.8%). Across the 6 studies the racial distribution included: > 85% White; 0.2%–10.7% Black or African American; 0%–1.7% Asian; < 1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; ≤ 1%, American Indian or Alaskan Native. Ethnicity data were not collected in Study 11; in the 5 other studies 0.6%–4.8% were Hispanic or Latino.

In five studies,6–8,10,11subjects with pre-existing underlying diseases were enrolled if the medical condition was stable (did not require a change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease for 12 weeks before receipt of study vaccine) except in Study 9 where subjects were enrolled if the medical condition was stable for 6 or more weeks before receipt of study vaccine.

In the 6 safety and immunogenicity studies,6–11subjects were excluded from study participation due to prior receipt of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines within 6 months of study vaccine. However, the time of prior receipt of a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine was not recorded.

Solicited adverse reactions for Prevnar 13 in the safety and immunogenicity studies were monitored by subjects recording local adverse reactions and systemic reactions daily using an electronic diary for 14 consecutive days following vaccination. Unsolicited serious and non-serious adverse events were collected for one month after each vaccination. In addition, serious adverse events were collected for an additional 5 months after each vaccination (at the 6-month follow-up phone contact) in all studies except Study 11.

Following licensure of Prevnar 13 in adults ≥ 50 years of age, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled US study (Study 13) was conducted to evaluate concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent (FluzoneQuadrivalent, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Brisbane, and B/Massachusetts, Fall 2014/Spring 2015: IIV4) in PPSV23 previously vaccinated adults ≥ 50 years of age. Unsolicited serious and non-serious adverse events were collected as described above for Studies 6–10.
