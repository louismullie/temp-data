## Question

Treatment for dislocation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of joint dislocations across multiple anatomic sites, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal acute management principles that apply to all dislocations. Then, I should verify joint-specific nuances for shoulder, patella, elbow, hip, knee, AC joint, and TMJ. Next, I will examine special populations and contexts like athletes, pediatrics, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight evidence gaps that could change practice, ensuring I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the universal principles that apply regardless of joint: immediate reduction to restore alignment, thorough neurovascular assessment before and after reduction, adequate analgesia or anesthesia to overcome muscle spasm, and post-reduction imaging to confirm concentric reduction and exclude fractures or other associated injuries; I need to ensure I emphasize that delays in reduction increase difficulty and complications, so time-to-reduction matters clinically even if high-quality comparative trials are sparse [^116f3a7u] [^113Nm8ep].

> Now, for the shoulder, I should verify the acute priorities: closed reduction with appropriate analgesia or intra-articular lidocaine, followed by immobilization and rehabilitation; wait, let me verify the immobilization position controversy — multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show no consistent advantage of external rotation over internal rotation immobilization, so position can be chosen for comfort while focusing on early, structured rehabilitation and return-to-activity progression [^112Etk88] [^111d6znf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery after a first-time anterior shoulder dislocation; I should double-check the risk stratification. In young, active patients — especially males under 25 — the recurrence risk is high, and randomized data show that early arthroscopic Bankart repair markedly reduces recurrence compared with nonoperative care, with an NNT around 2.5–5.6; however, about half of nonoperatively managed patients do not redislocate by 2 years, so shared decision-making is essential, and there is no high-quality RCT evidence for chronic instability comparing surgery to nonoperative care, which I should explicitly note to avoid overstatement [^114ib8mi] [^112WfejP] [^1125Qa5h] [^114UEANe].

> For patellar dislocation, I need to check whether surgery helps after a first event; the most recent Cochrane review concludes the certainty is very low, with conflicting results across trials, so nonoperative management remains reasonable for most first-time dislocations, reserving surgery for recurrent instability, osteochondral fragments, or high-risk anatomy; let me reconsider the functional outcomes — some studies suggest short-term improvements with surgery, but long-term functional advantages are unproven, reinforcing a conservative-first approach in the absence of clear indications [^116NL1kT] [^117CTS5D] [^117ArvXN].

> For elbow dislocations, I should confirm that most simple dislocations are managed nonoperatively with a brief period of immobilization followed by early motion; wait, I should verify whether early mobilization improves outcomes — RCTs and long-term cohort data suggest early motion improves range of motion without increasing instability, and routine primary ligament repair does not improve long-term function compared with conservative care, so surgery is reserved for persistent instability or associated fractures [^116Kyp5N] [^112LQiWj] [^111WVQic].

> For traumatic hip dislocations, I need to ensure I emphasize emergent reduction within 6 hours to mitigate osteonecrosis risk, followed by MRI to detect occult fractures or labral pathology; let me verify management of post-arthroplasty dislocations — most require closed reduction first, with operative options such as constrained liners or revision considered for recurrent instability, ideally in specialized centers given the heterogeneity of causes and techniques [^1156Dqrn] [^115n2kFh].

> Knee dislocations are a different beast; I should confirm that immediate closed reduction is mandatory, followed by urgent vascular assessment because popliteal artery injury is common, and then staged ligament reconstruction is typically preferred over acute repair; hold on, I should verify the rationale — early motion after staged reconstruction improves outcomes and reduces stiffness, aligning with contemporary multiligament knee injury protocols [^112hzaFB] [^113ZQhYB] [^1111c5Yg].

> For acromioclavicular joint dislocations, I should double-check that low-grade injuries (Rockwood I–II) are treated conservatively, whereas high-grade injuries (IV–VI) generally warrant surgery; but wait, type III remains controversial — multiple RCTs and systematic reviews show no consistent superiority of surgery over conservative care at one year, with earlier functional recovery after nonoperative treatment, so individualized decisions based on activity demands and symptoms are prudent [^113XETWi] [^1139TZv9] [^111THXMq].

> For temporomandibular joint dislocations, I will now examine the acute and chronic pathways; acute anterior dislocations are reduced manually with or without sedation, while chronic or recurrent cases may require maxillomandibular fixation or, in longstanding destructive cases, total joint replacement; I should confirm that identifying predisposing factors like hypermobility or seizure disorder helps tailor prevention strategies [^113LhgPo] [^1125oFMC] [^1154JW1T].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts; in-season athletes with anterior shoulder dislocation often pursue nonoperative care to return that season despite high recurrence risk, whereas definitive stabilization is typically deferred to the off-season; for pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip, I need to ensure I note that prolonged Pavlik harness use beyond 2–4 weeks for irreducible hips may worsen acetabular morphology, though emerging data challenge the severity of this effect; in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with recurrent multijoint dislocations, sclerosant prolotherapy has early supportive data but requires higher-quality trials before routine use [^111gSrPY] [^115QMTdW] [^115Lyn5A] [^112rdBzS].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework without oversimplifying: stratify by joint, age, activity, injury pattern, and comorbidities; prioritize reduction and neurovascular status; choose immobilization and rehabilitation based on joint-specific evidence; reserve surgery for failure of conservative care, high-risk anatomy, or patient preference after informed discussion; I need to ensure I explicitly acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is low quality to avoid overpromising outcomes.

> Finally, I should double-check key evidence gaps that could change practice: optimal immobilization parameters after shoulder dislocation remain unsettled; the role and timing of surgery for chronic shoulder instability lack high-quality RCTs; patellar dislocation management needs larger, standardized trials; and long-term osteoarthritis risk after different shoulder treatments is still being clarified — let me verify that these gaps are indeed reflected in recent systematic reviews and editorials before concluding [^112Etk88] [^114UEANe] [^116NL1kT] [^116zJtuS].

Treatment of dislocation centers on **prompt reduction** to restore joint alignment and preserve function, followed by **immobilization** to protect healing tissues and structured rehabilitation to restore strength and stability [^117UE8vV]. Nonoperative care is first-line for most first-time dislocations, but surgery is indicated for **recurrent instability**, associated fractures, or failed closed reduction [^113v7aPG] [^111WVQic] [^117UE8vV]. Early mobilization after a short immobilization period reduces stiffness and improves outcomes [^112LQiWj]; long-term management focuses on preventing recurrence and complications through patient education and targeted rehabilitation [^113v7aPG].

---

## Initial management and reduction

### Pre-reduction assessment

Before reduction, perform a **neurovascular assessment** to document baseline status and detect injury, and obtain **imaging** (X-rays) to confirm the diagnosis, assess for fractures, and guide the reduction technique [^111Z647m] [^1127jq8c].

---

### Reduction techniques

- **Closed reduction**: The primary method for most dislocations; techniques vary by joint and include traction-countertraction, leverage, and scapular manipulation for shoulders [^notfound].

- **Analgesia and sedation**: Intra-articular lidocaine or conscious sedation facilitates reduction and reduces pain [^116f3a7u].

- **Open reduction**: Indicated for failed closed reduction, irreducible dislocations, or associated fractures [^notfound].

---

## Post-reduction immobilization

### Duration and position of immobilization

- **Shoulder dislocation**: Immobilize for 2–4 weeks; external rotation may reduce recurrence, but evidence is mixed [^112Etk88] [^111d6znf].

- **Elbow dislocation**: Immobilize for 1–2 weeks, then early motion to prevent stiffness [^112LQiWj].

- **Patellar dislocation**: Immobilize for 2–4 weeks, then gradual rehabilitation [^notfound].

- **Hip dislocation**: Immobilize for 2–6 weeks, depending on associated injuries [^notfound].

---

## Rehabilitation and physical therapy

### Goals of rehabilitation

Rehabilitation aims to restore **range of motion** with progressive exercises to regain joint mobility, and to strengthen **dynamic stabilizers** — particularly the rotator cuff and scapular muscles for shoulder dislocations [^113v7aPG]. Functional training uses sport- or activity-specific drills to support safe return to activity [^notfound].

---

### Typical rehabilitation timeline

| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Focus** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | 0–2 weeks | - Pain control <br/> - Gentle ROM <br/> - Protection of healing tissues |
| Subacute | 2–6 weeks | - Progressive ROM <br/> - Isometric strengthening <br/> - Proprioceptive training |
| Chronic | 6–12 weeks | - Advanced strengthening <br/> - Functional training <br/> - Return-to-sport |

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is considered when **recurrent instability** persists despite rehabilitation, when **associated fractures** or large bony defects require stabilization, or when closed reduction fails and open reduction is necessary [^112YXSj4] [^114ib8mi].

---

## Complications and long-term outcomes

### Potential complications

Potential complications include **recurrent dislocation** — especially in younger patients and in the shoulder and patella [^114ib8mi] [^116NL1kT] joint stiffness or contractures from prolonged immobilization, and osteoarthritis from repeated dislocations or surgical interventions [^117BYdPD].

---

### Long-term outcomes

With appropriate treatment, most patients regain **functional range of motion** and strength, and **return to activity** is successful with rehabilitation and education [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Higher recurrence risk; conservative management is preferred, but surgery may be indicated for recurrent instability [^116tjwUZ].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of fractures and complications; conservative management is often preferred [^111yrwyb].

- **Athletes**: Early surgery may be considered in high-risk athletes to prevent recurrence and enable faster return to sport [^1151gooA].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education and prevention focus on **education** about injury mechanisms, recurrence risk, and self-protection, and on **home exercises** for strengthening and proprioceptive training to reduce recurrence risk [^113WWLqH].

---

Treatment of dislocation involves **reduction, immobilization, and rehabilitation**, with surgery reserved for specific indications. Most patients regain function and return to activity, but recurrence and complications can occur, especially without adherence to rehabilitation and prevention strategies.

Introduction

The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large joint. A traumatic shoulder dislocation is often accompanied by a labral lesion, which predisposes the patient to developing chronic shoulder instability. The incidence of primary shoulder dislocation varies between 15.3and 56.3per 100 000 person-years. Most patients are men aged under 40 years and most dislocations are sports injuries. Both these facts make shoulder dislocation and possible subsequent chronic instability an important health issue for young, active patients and their treating clinicians.

Acute treatment of a dislocated shoulder is closed reduction, which should be performed as soon as possible, either on the field or in an emergency department. Some patients develop recurrent dislocations or symptomatic subluxations even in daily activities. This has prompted suggestions that surgical stabilisation may be indicated after the first dislocation — a treatment strategy that has been investigated in several randomised controlled trials (RCT), with mixed results.

There is considerable variation in the management of patients after a primary traumatic shoulder dislocation (both between surgeons and disciplines). Most patients with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability are offered stabilisation surgery, while the surgical methods vary widely. Some evidence suggests that in the management of musculoskeletal conditions patients are more likely to undergo surgical treatment if the treating physician is a surgeon versus a non-surgical specialty (eg, physiotherapy), and that surgeons more easily recommend surgical treatment if the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery is inconclusive. Thus, to provide the best care, physiotherapists, physical medicine specialists, sports medicine specialists and orthopaedic surgeons should know what is the best quality evidence for treatment of shoulder instability.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation and in chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability. Our systematic review focused on two clinical effectiveness questions regarding post-traumatic shoulder instability: (1) What are the best treatments to reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder instability after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation? and (2) How can the clinician best treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability?

Future research

The most important evidence gaps regarding clinical practice are the effectiveness of surgery for chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability and what is the ideal physiotherapy regime for non-surgical management after a primary traumatic dislocation or for chronic post-traumatic instability. The impact of surgery to patient quality of life should also be investigated. Future trials should be adequately designed, powered and reported, and use validated measures of disability or function in addition to the shoulder redislocation rate. Due to the placebo effects associated with surgery, further trials should be double blinded and placebo controlled whenever possible.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation [^116NL1kT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar (knee cap) dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. It affects up to 42/100,000 people, and is most prevalent in those aged 20 to 30 years old. It is uncertain whether surgical or non-surgical treatment is the best approach. This is important as recurrent dislocation occurs in up to 40% of people who experience a first time (primary) dislocation. This can reduce quality of life and as a result people have to modify their lifestyle. This review is needed to determine whether surgical or non-surgical treatment should be offered to people after patellar dislocation.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and trial registries in December 2021. We contacted corresponding authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating primary or recurrent lateral patellar dislocation in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent patellar dislocation, and patient-rated knee and physical function scores. Our secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, return to former activities, knee pain during activity or at rest, adverse events, patient-reported satisfaction, patient-reported knee instability symptoms and subsequent requirement for knee surgery. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two quasi-RCTs) of 519 participants with patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 13.0 to 27.2 years. Four studies included children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults; two only recruited children. Study follow-up ranged from one to 14 years. We are unsure of the evidence for all outcomes in this review because we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded each outcome by three levels. Reasons included imprecision (when fewer than 100 events were reported or the confidence interval (CI) indicated appreciable benefits as well as harms), risk of bias (when studies were at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias), and inconsistency (in the event that pooled analysis included high levels of statistical heterogeneity). We are uncertain whether surgery lowers the risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation compared with non-surgical management at two to nine year follow-up. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 348 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, we found that 157 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 209 fewer to 87 fewer) had recurrent dislocation between two and nine years after surgery (8 studies, 438 participants). We are uncertain whether surgery improves patient-rated knee and function scores. Studies measured this outcome using different scales (the Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score and Hughston visual analogue scale). The most frequently reported score was the Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score. This indicated people in the surgical group had a mean score of 5.73 points higher at two to nine year follow-up (95% CI 2.91 lower to 14.37 higher; 7 studies, 401 participants). On this 100-point scale, higher scores indicate better function, and a change score of 10 points is considered to be clinically meaningful; therefore, this CI includes a possible meaningful improvement. We are uncertain whether surgery increases the risk of adverse events. Based on an assumed risk of overall incidence of complications during the first two years in 277 people out of 1000 in the non-surgical group, 335 more people per 1000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 723 more) had an adverse event in the surgery group (2 studies, 144 participants). Three studies (176 participants) assessed participant satisfaction at two to nine year follow-up, reporting little difference between groups. Based on an assumed risk of 763 per 1000 non-surgical participants reporting excellent or good outcomes, seven more participants per 1000 (95% CI 199 fewer to 237 more) reported excellent or good satisfaction. Four studies (256 participants) assessed recurrent patellar subluxation at two to nine year follow-up. Based on an assumed risk of patellar subluxation in 292 out of 1000 in the non-surgical group, 73 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 146 fewer to 35 more) had patellar subluxation as a result of surgery. Slightly more people had subsequent surgery in the non-surgical group. Pooled two to nine year follow-up data from three trials (195 participants) indicated that, based on an assumed risk of subsequent surgery in 215 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, 118 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 372 more) had subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether surgery improves outcome compared to non-surgical management as the certainty of the evidence was very low. No sufficiently powered trial has examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multicentre, randomised trials are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non-surgical interventions, and the pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions.

### Editorial commentary: immediate surgical stabilization following a first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation is still the best evidence-based approach [^1151gooA]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations are unfortunately common. The initial dislocation is enough to cause permanent anatomic and biomechanical alterations to the glenohumeral joint, which increases the likelihood of further events. When a patient crosses into the multiple dislocator category, further soft-tissue and bony injury occurs. This is almost certainly the reason that the number of preoperative dislocations significantly diminishes the success of an arthroscopic stabilization and increases the need for a more aggressive approach that may carry greater risks of complications. When it comes to recurrent instability, there remains very little doubt regarding the appropriate treatment for a first-time traumatic dislocation: immediate surgical stabilization! Assuming no significant glenoid or humeral bone loss, arthroscopic stabilization remains an effective surgery with a high-benefit, low-risk profile, especially when combined with a remplissage in high-risk circumstances. At least 4 randomized controlled trials support immediate versus nonoperative management for every outcome measured: recurrence, return to sport, patient-reported outcomes, and sustained event-free survival, especially pronounced at 2 years. The decision to recommend surgery, is of course, not always straightforward, necessitating an informed discussion with the patient and the family, especially when other outcomes such as return to play are deemed equally relevant and can be successfully achieved with nonoperative management. Nonetheless, more than any other outcome measure, is there a more important outcome than recurrence regarding long-term health implications? Lastly, can we do better with study designs and outcome measures to better understand risk factors to identify patients better suited for surgery after a first-time event than others? Absolutely. But until then, when up to 60% can sustain a recurrent dislocation in this population, and up to 90% in high-risk individuals, the odds are not in my favor with nonoperative treatment. Despite potential limitations in our current literature, immediate surgery following a first-time dislocation is still the best evidence-based approach.

### Interventions for treating acute elbow dislocations in adults [^116Kyp5N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dislocation of the elbow joint is a relatively uncommon injury.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various forms of treatment for acute simple elbow dislocations in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March Week 5 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 14), PEDro (April 2011), CINAHL (April 2011), various trial registers, various conference proceedings and bibliographies of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of conservative and surgical treatment of dislocations of the elbow in adults. Excluded were trials involving dislocations with associated fractures, except for avulsion fractures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were independently performed by two review authors. There was no pooling of data.

Main Results

Two small randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 80 participants with simple elbow dislocations, were included. Both trials were methodologically flawed and potentially biased. One trial, involving 50 participants, compared early mobilisation at three days post reduction versus cast immobilisation. At one year follow-up, the recovery of range of motion appeared better in the early mobilisation group (e.g. participants with incomplete recovery of extension: 1/24 versus 5/26; risk ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72). However, the results were not statistically significant. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. One person in each group had residual pain at one year. The other trial, involving 30 participants, compared surgical repair of the torn ligaments versus conservative treatment (cast immobilisation for two weeks). At final follow-up (mean 27.5 months), there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the numbers of patients who considered their injured elbow to be inferior to their non-injured elbow (10/14 versus 7/14; RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.66) or in other patient complaints about their elbow such as weakness, pain or weather-related discomfort. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in range of motion of the elbow (extension, flexion, pronation, and supination) or grip strength at follow-up. No participants had neurological disturbances of the hand but two surgical group participants had recurrent dislocation of the ulnar nerve (no other details provided). One person in each group had radiologically detected myositis ossificans (bone formation within muscles following injury).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for simple dislocations of the elbow in adults. Although weak and inconclusive, the available evidence from a trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment does not suggest that the surgical repair of elbow ligaments for simple elbow dislocation improves long-term function. Future research should focus on questions relating to non-surgical treatment, such as the duration of immobilisation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation [^117CTS5D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patellar dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. Following reduction of the dislocation, conservative (non-surgical) rehabilitation with physiotherapy may be used. Since recurrence of dislocation is common, some surgeons have advocated surgical intervention rather than non-surgical interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ZETOC, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and a variety of other literature databases and trial registries. Corresponding authors were contacted to identify additional studies. The last search was carried out in October 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating lateral patellar dislocation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts of each identified study to assess study eligibility, extract data and assess risk of bias. The primary outcomes we assessed were the frequency of recurrent dislocation, and validated patient-rated knee or physical function scores. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences MD) for continuous outcomes. When appropriate, we pooled data.

Main Results

We included five randomised studies and one quasi-randomised study. These recruited a total of 344 people with primary (first-time) patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 19.3 to 25.7 years, with four studies including children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults. Follow-up for the full study populations ranged from two to nine years across the six studies. The quality of the evidence is very low as assessed by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) criteria, with all studies being at high risk of performance and detection biases, relating to the lack of blinding. There was very low quality but consistent evidence that participants managed surgically had a significantly lower risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation at two to five years follow-up (21/162 versus 32/136; RR 0.53 favouring surgery, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.87; five studies, 294 participants). Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 222 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 104 fewer (95% CI 149 fewer to 28 fewer) people per 1000 having recurrent dislocation after surgery. Similarly, there is evidence of a lower risk of recurrent dislocation after surgery at six to nine years (RR 0.67 favouring surgery, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.08; two studies, 165 participants), but a small increase cannot be ruled out. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 336 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 110 fewer (95% CI 195 fewer to 27 more) people per 1000 having recurrent dislocation after surgery. The very low quality evidence available from single trials only for four validated patient-rated knee and physical function scores (the Tegner activity scale, KOOS, Lysholm and Hughston VAS (visual analogue scale) score) did not show significant differences between the two treatment groups. The results for the Kujala patellofemoral disorders score (0 to 100: best outcome) differed in direction of effect at two to five years follow-up, which favoured the surgery group (MD 13.93 points higher, 95% CI 5.33 points higher to 22.53 points higher; four studies, 171 participants) and the six to nine years follow-up, which favoured the non-surgical treatment group (MD 3.25 points lower, 95% CI 10.61 points lower to 4.11 points higher; two studies, 167 participants). However, only the two to five years follow-up included the clear possibility of a clinically important effect (putative minimal clinically important difference for this outcome is 10 points). Adverse effects of treatment were reported in one trial only; all four major complications were attributed to the surgical treatment group. Slightly more people in the surgery group had subsequent surgery six to nine years after their primary dislocation (20/87 versus 16/78; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89, two studies, 165 participants). Based on an illustrative risk of subsequent surgery in 186 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 11 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 171 more) people per 1000 having subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is some evidence to support surgical over non-surgical management of primary patellar dislocation in the short term, the quality of this evidence is very low because of the high risk of bias and the imprecision in the effect estimates. We are therefore very uncertain about the estimate of effect. No trials examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multi-centre, randomised controlled trials, conducted and reported to contemporary standards, are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non-surgical interventions, and the anatomical or pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions and the natural history of patellar instability. Furthermore, well-designed studies recording adverse events and long-term outcomes are needed.

### Operative and non-operative treatment options for dislocation of the hip following total hip arthroplasty [^115P9ih6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dislocation following hip replacement is associated with significant morbidity and functional cost. The cause is usually multifactorial. A variety of treatment options are available which can broadly be classified into operative and non-operative.

Objectives

To determine the best methods of treatment of recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement.

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched until August 2006: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), and MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing operative and non-operative treatments for recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to identified studies.

Main Results

Searches identified 269 studies. None fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

The authors invite researchers to perform RCTs comparing different treatment options for recurrent dislocation of the hip. The heterogeneity of the population and variety of underlying causes would favour a multi-centre study to achieve an adequate sample size.

### Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating acromioclavicular dislocation of the shoulder in adults [^113XETWi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint is one of the most common shoulder injuries in a sport-active population. The question of whether surgery should be used remains controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating acromioclavicular dislocations in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2019), Embase (1980 to June 2019), and LILACS (1982 to June 2019), trial registries, and reference lists of articles. There were no restrictions based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared surgical with conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included five randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial. The included trials involved 357 mainly young adults, the majority of whom were male, with acute acromioclavicular dislocation. The strength of the findings in all studies was limited due to design features, invariably lack of blinding, that carry a high risk of bias. Fixation of the acromioclavicular joint using hook plates, tunnelled suspension devices, coracoclavicular screws, acromioclavicular pins, or (usually threaded) wires was compared with supporting the arm in a sling or similar device. After surgery, the arm was also supported in a sling or similar device in all trials. Where described in the trials, both groups had exercise-based rehabilitation. We downgraded the evidence for all outcomes at least two levels, invariably for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision. Low-quality evidence from two studies showed no evidence of a difference between groups in shoulder function at one year, assessed using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) (0 (best function) to 100 (worst function)): mean difference (MD) 0.73 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.70 to 4.16; 112 participants. These results were consistent with other measures of function at one-year or longer follow-up, including non-validated outcome scores reported by three studies. There is low-quality evidence that function at six weeks may be better after conservative treatment, indicating an earlier recovery. Very low-quality evidence from one trial found no difference between groups in participants reporting pain at one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.19; 79 participants. There is very low-quality evidence that surgery may not reduce the risk of treatment failure, usually resulting in non-routine secondary surgery: 14/168 versus 15/174; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.94; 342 participants, 6 studies. The main source of treatment failure was complications related to surgical implants in the surgery group and persistent symptoms, mainly discomfort, due to the acromioclavicular dislocation in the conservatively treated group. There is low-quality evidence from two studies that there may be little or no difference between groups in the return to former activities (sports or work) at one year: 57/67 versus 62/70; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; 137 participants, 2 studies. Low-quality but consistent evidence from four studies indicated an earlier recovery in conservatively treated participants compared with those treated with surgery. There is low-quality evidence of no clinically important difference between groups at one year in quality of life scores, measured using the 36-item or 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 or SF-12) (0-to-100 scale, where 100 is best score), in either the physical component (MD -0.63, 95% CI -2.63 to 1.37; 122 participants, 2 studies) or mental component (MD 0.47 points, 95% CI -1.51 to 2.44; 122 participants). There is very low-quality and clinically heterogenous evidence of a greater risk of an adverse event after surgery: 45/168 versus 16/174; RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.82; 342 participants, 6 studies; I² = 48%. Common adverse outcomes were hardware complications or discomfort (18.5%) and infection (8.7%) in the surgery group and persistent symptoms (7.1%), mainly discomfort, in the conservatively treated group. The majority of surgical complications occurred in older studies testing now-outdated devices known for their high risk of complications. The very low-quality evidence from one study (70 participants) means that we are uncertain whether there is a between-group difference in patient dissatisfaction with cosmetic results. It is notable that the evidence for function, return to former activities, and quality of life came from the two most recently conducted studies, which tested currently used devices and interventions in clearly defined participant populations that represented the commonly perceived population for which there is uncertainty over the use of surgery. There were insufficient data to conduct subgroup analysis relating to type of injury and whether surgery involved ligament reconstruction or not.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that surgical treatment has no additional benefits in terms of function, return to former activities, and quality of life at one year compared with conservative treatment. There is, however, low-quality evidence that people treated conservatively had improved function at six weeks compared with surgical management. There is very low-quality evidence of little difference between the two treatments in pain at one year, treatment failure usually resulting in secondary surgery, or patient satisfaction with cosmetic result. Although surgery may result in more people sustaining adverse events, this varied between the trials, being more common in techniques such as K-wire fixation that are rarely used today. There remains a need to consider the balance of risks between the individual outcomes: for example, surgical adverse events, including wound infection or dehiscence and hardware complication, against risk of adverse events that may be more commonly associated with conservative treatment such as persistent symptoms or discomfort, or both. There is a need for sufficiently powered, good-quality, well-reported randomised trials of currently used surgical interventions versus conservative treatment for well-defined injuries.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^112vK8J3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statementwhen conducting and reporting this prospectively registered systematic review (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42015020303). We use dislocation to refer to a true dislocation of the joint and instability to refer to dislocations, subluxations or other symptoms of instability either alone or together. By recurrent dislocation(s) and redislocation(s) we mean one or more dislocations after the primary episode, and by chronic post-traumatic instability we mean recurrent dislocation(s), subluxations or other symptoms of instability occurring after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation.

Data sources and searches

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Web of Science on 15 January 2018. There were no restrictions on language or publication date. We adjusted the search strategies to meet the specifications of the individual databases (online supplementary appendix 1). We reviewed the reference lists of included publications and earlier reviews to identify any additional studies that were missed in the electronic database search. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 23 January 2018 for registrations of the included RCTs, possible completed but unpublished RCTs and ongoing RCTs.

Study selection

We included RCTs that compared any interventions after a first-time, traumatic shoulder dislocation or chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability with a follow-up of at least 1 year. We required an outcome measure related to shoulder instability, shoulder function or quality of life. We excluded studies of treatment of non-traumatic shoulder instability, cadaveric or biomechanical studies and studies on secondary shoulder instability (such as neurological conditions, syndromes or congenital conditions). Two investigators (LK and TL) independently assessed all identified publications for eligibility and resolved any disagreements by consensus.

### Temporomandibular joint dislocation [^113LhgPo]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is one of many pathophysiologic joint conditions that the oral and maxillofacial surgeon is challenged with managing. Managing a dislocated joint will inevitably be the challenge of most surgeons or physicians, whether in private or academic practice. Accordingly, this article addresses the pathophysiology associated with dislocation, in addition to treatment strategies aimed at managing acute, chronic, and recurrent dislocation.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^115jRw1U]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our review aimed to answer two patient-oriented questions relevant to clinical practice: (1) What are the best treatments to reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder instability after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation? and (2) How should the clinician best treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability? Evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of surgery versus non-surgical treatment is currently available only for a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation: early surgery led to fewer shoulder redislocations. However, approximately half of the patients primarily treated non-surgically do not experience a shoulder redislocation or develop shoulder instability within 2 years of the primary injury. Immobilisation in ER was not beneficial after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation compared with immobilisation in IR.

For the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, we did not identify any RCTs that assessed the effectiveness or efficacy of surgery versus non-surgical measures or sham surgery. Open Bankart repair produced more reliable results than the arthroscopic method for prevention of shoulder redislocations. There were no differences between other technical aspects of surgery.

Treatment after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation

Labrum repair was more effective than non-surgical treatment for first-time dislocation in terms of fewer redislocations. Arthroscopic lavage was no more effective at 2 years compared with non-surgical treatment, making arthroscopic lavage a candidate placebo surgical treatment in this context. Our NMA indicated a beneficial effect of labrum repair on the incidence of shoulder redislocation when compared with non-surgical treatment. The NNT — in this context the number of patients who needed to undergo surgery to prevent one patient having a shoulder redislocation — was 2.5–5.6 based on external dataand 2.0–4.7 based on the data in the included trials.

Regarding disease-specific quality of life, no meaningful meta-analysis was possible. There were some differences between the treatment alternatives in favour of labrum repair (online supplementary appendix table 5). Even though the differences were small, they were consistent with and explained by the reduced risk of shoulder redislocations and chronic instability in the groups treated with labrum repair.

### Acute rehabilitation following traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation (ARTISAN): pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^113v7aPG]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The shoulder is the most frequently dislocated joint. Dislocation happens when excessive forces during a traumatic event displace the humeral head out of the shoulder socket resulting in the joint surfaces completely losing contact. In 95% of cases, the shoulder dislocates anteriorly (forwards). After a shoulder dislocation has occurred, emergency treatment is required to reduce the dislocation and to support the arm in a sling.

A 2019 population based cohort of 16 763 people reported the incidence to be 40.4 per 100 000 person years in men and 15.5 in women. The highest incidence was in men aged 16–20 years (805 per 100 000 person years) with a second peak in women aged 61–70 years (28.1 per 100 000 person years). The first peak is attributed to sporting injuries, the second peak is associated with injuries incurred during a fall in an ageing population.

Non-operative rehabilitation care is the most common first line treatment, typically involving the arm being supported in a sling for up to two weeks, for comfort and to allow healing. This treatment is followed by rehabilitation for up to six months. Rehabilitation helps support people to restore a functional, painless shoulder and is achieved through restoration of movement and retraining muscles.

During this period of rehabilitation, people experience pain and disability due to decreased movement of the arm. As such, simple tasks, such as getting dressed, can become difficult. Some people also experience a constant sensation that the shoulder is going to dislocate again, which stops them from returning to some activities. Within 12 months, one in five people will re-dislocate their shoulder, leading to repeated visits to the emergency department and ongoing pain.

Despite the important role of rehabilitation for this common condition, evidence comparing different rehabilitation methods after the initial period in a sling is scarce. Guideline recommendations internationally range from advice only to advice and an additional programme of supervised physiotherapy.

The choice of rehabilitation offered following a shoulder dislocation has large resource implications for the participant and health care provider. Younger people may need to take time from work or arrange care for dependents and older people may find travel challenging particularly if unable to drive following the dislocation. Consequently, if a single advice session were all that is required, the burden on patients and the healthcare resources required would lessen.

Considering the large personal and societal cost associated with this injury, the primary objective of the ARTISAN trial was to compare the clinical effectiveness of two rehabilitation interventions in adults with a first time traumatic shoulder dislocation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute anterior shoulder dislocation [^111yrwyb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and more susceptible to re-dislocation, especially in active young adults.

Objectives

We aimed to compare surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (August 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to September week 3 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 week 39), the National Research Register (UK) (Issue 3, 2003), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating acute anterior shoulder dislocation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of the included trials was by all three reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled.

Main Results

Five studies were included. These involved a total of 239 young (mainly aged around 22 years) active and mainly male people, all of whom had had a primary (first time) traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Methodological quality was variable, but notably there was insufficient information to judge whether allocation was effectively concealed in all five trials. Two trials, involving 115 participants, were only reported in conference abstracts. One trial involving military personnel reported that all had returned to active duty. Another trial reported similar numbers in the two intervention groups with reduced sports participation, and a third trial reported that significantly fewer people in the surgical group failed to attain previous levels of sports activity. Pooled results from all five trials showed that subsequent instability, either redislocation or subluxation, was statistically significantly less frequent in the surgical group (relative risk (RR) 0.20; 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.33). This result remained statistically significant (RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.59) for the three trials reported in full. Half (17/33) of the conservatively treated patients with shoulder instability in these three trials opted for subsequent surgery. Different, mainly patient-rated, functional assessment measures for the shoulder were recorded in the five trials. The results were more favourable, usually statistically significantly so, in the surgically treated group. Aside from a septic joint in a surgically treated patient, there were no other treatment complications reported. There was no information on shoulder pain, long-term complications such as osteoarthritis or on service utilisation and resource use.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The limited evidence available supports primary surgery for young adults, usually male, engaged in highly demanding physical activities who have sustained their first acute traumatic shoulder dislocation. There is no evidence available to determine whether non-surgical treatment should not remain the prime treatment option for other categories of patient. Sufficiently powered, good quality and adequately reported randomised trials of good standard surgical treatment versus good standard conservative treatment for well-defined injuries are required; in particular, for patient categories at lower risk of activity-limiting recurrence. Long term surveillance of outcome, looking at shoulder disorders including osteoarthritis is also required. Reviews comparing different surgical interventions and different conservative interventions including rehabilitation are needed.

### First-time anterior shoulder dislocations: has the standard changed? [^1116VCPu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The traditional treatment of a first-time anterior shoulder dislocation of reduction and a period of immobilisation should be challenged. The purpose of this review is to assimilate and present the current literature on acute anterior shoulder instability. This involves consideration of the pathoanatomy, natural history and the more recent evaluation of treatment outcomes, which appropriately incorporate quality of life measures in addition to recurrences. There is ample evidence to consider primary stabilisation as an option for treatment in the high-risk group, less than 25 years of age.

### Glenohumeral instability and dislocation [^111knKVS]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Glenohumeral joint instability and dislocations are common diagnoses seen by physicians. There are many different pathologic etiologies for these conditions. A thorough understanding of the history, physical examination, pathoanatomy, and classification systems is required to make an accurate diagnosis. With the appropriate diagnosis, the clinician can choose the correct treatment and improve the patient's outcome.

### Best evidence topic report. how to immobilise after shoulder dislocation? [^11364g7m]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish the best way to immobilise dislocated shoulders after reduction. A total of 47 papers were identified using the reported search, of which four represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. For patients with a first anterior shoulder dislocation immobilisation in external rotation may be of more benefit than immobilisation in internal rotation.

### Traumatic knee dislocations: evaluation, management, and surgical treatment [^112hzaFB]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Knee dislocations are catastrophic injuries that demand emergent evaluation and often require a multidisciplinary approach. Long-term outcome studies are relatively scarce secondary to the variability in any given study population and the wide variety of injury patterns between knee dislocations. Multiple controversies exist with regard to outcomes using various treatment methods (early vs late intervention, graft selection, repair vs reconstruction of medial and lateral structures, rehabilitation regimens). Careful clinical evaluation is essential when knee dislocation is suspected.

### Conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder [^112Etk88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute anterior shoulder dislocation, which is the most common type of dislocation, usually results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to re-dislocation or recurrent instability (e.g. subluxation), especially in active young adults. After closed reduction, most of these injuries are treated with immobilisation of the injured arm in a sling or brace for a few weeks, followed by exercises. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006 and last updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro and trial registries. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies. Date of last search: May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing conservative interventions with no treatment, a different intervention or a variant of the intervention (e.g. a different duration) for treating people after closed reduction of a primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Inclusion was regardless of age, sex or mechanism of injury. Primary outcomes were re-dislocation, patient-reported shoulder instability measures and return to pre-injury activities. Secondary outcomes included participant satisfaction, health-related quality of life, any instability and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled results of comparable groups of studies. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included seven trials (six randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised controlled trial) with 704 participants; three of these trials (234 participants) are new to this update. The mean age across the trials was 29 years (range 12 to 90 years), and 82% of the participants were male. All trials compared immobilisation in external rotation (with or without an additional abduction component) versus internal rotation (the traditional method) following closed reduction. No trial evaluated any other interventions or comparisons, such as rehabilitation. All trials provided data for a follow-up of one year or longer; the commonest length was two years or longer. All trials were at some risk of bias, commonly performance and detection biases given the lack of blinding. Two trials were at high risk of selection bias and some trials were affected by attrition bias for some outcomes. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. We are uncertain whether immobilisation in external rotation makes a difference to the risk of re-dislocation after 12 months' or longer follow-up compared with immobilisation in internal rotation (55/245 versus 73/243; risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.19; 488 participants; 6 studies; I² = 61%; very low certainty evidence). In a moderate-risk population with an illustrative risk of 312 per 1000 people experiencing a dislocation in the internal rotation group, this equates to 103 fewer (95% CI 194 fewer to 60 more) re-dislocations after immobilisation in external rotation. Thus this result covers the possibility of a benefit for each intervention. Individually, the four studies (380 participants) reporting on validated patient-reported outcome measures for shoulder instability at a minimum of 12 months' follow-up found no evidence of a clinically important difference between the two interventions. We are uncertain of the relative effects of the two methods of immobilisation on resumption of pre-injury activities or sports. One study (169 participants) found no evidence of a difference between interventions in the return to pre-injury activity of the affected arm. Two studies (135 participants) found greater return to sports in the external rotation group in a subgroup of participants who had sustained their injury during sports activities. None of the trials reported on participant satisfaction or health-related quality of life. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the two interventions in the number of participants experiencing instability, defined as either re-dislocation or subluxation (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.14; 395 participants, 3 studies; very low certainty evidence). Data on adverse events were collected only in an ad hoc way in the seven studies. Reported "transient and resolved adverse events" were nine cases of shoulder stiffness or rigidity in the external rotation group and two cases of axillary rash in the internal rotation group. There were three "important" adverse events: hyperaesthesia and moderate hand pain; eighth cervical dermatome paraesthesia; and major movement restriction between 6 and 12 months. It was unclear to what extent these three events could be attributed to the treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence from randomised trials is limited to that comparing immobilisation in external versus internal rotation. Overall, the evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about whether immobilisation in external rotation confers any benefit over immobilisation in internal rotation. Considering that there are several unpublished and ongoing trials evaluating immobilisation in external versus internal rotation, the main priority for research on this question consists of the publication of completed trials and the completion and publication of ongoing trials. Meanwhile, evaluation of other interventions, including rehabilitation, is warranted. There is a need for sufficiently large, good-quality, well-reported randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up. Future research should aim to determine the optimal immobilisation duration, precise indications for immobilisation, optimal rehabilitation interventions, and the acceptability of these different interventions.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^112WfejP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There was an RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.8) for a recurrent dislocation after first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation in favour of labrum repair compared with physiotherapy. The certainty in the evidence was moderate. Forty-seven per cent of patients with a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation treated non-surgically did not experience a redislocation within 2 years.

What is already known on this subject?

After a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation, approximately half of patients developed recurrent shoulder dislocation within 2 years.
Some studies have shown promising results with surgery after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. Primary surgery has been advocated to prevent chronic shoulder instability.
Many patients with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability are offered stabilising surgery. Current practice favours arthroscopic labral repair over open surgery.

What this study adds?

There was moderate-quality evidence that patients who had labrum repair surgery after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation had lower recurrent dislocation rates than patients treated with physiotherapy. However, surgical treatment has a relatively high number needed to treat (2.5–5.6) to prevent redislocation.
In the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, effectiveness of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment is not known. Low-quality evidence supported open labrum repair over arthroscopic labrum repair.

### Management of the in-season athlete with an anterior shoulder dislocation [^111gSrPY]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of the in-season athlete presenting with an anterior shoulder dislocation is a nuanced process that continues to be refined. Options and pathways between nonoperative and operative treatment have undergone many iterations over a century of orthopedic research and advancement. It requires an understanding of sport-specific demands and the individual athlete's goals. The orthopedic surgeon must have mastery of the natural history, treatment options, and outcomes of anterior shoulder dislocations. Balance of these factors is delicate and highly individualized for each athlete, and is why management of the in-season athlete with an anterior shoulder dislocation remains an art for the orthopedic surgeon.

Materials and Methods

A narrative review of the literature regarding the in-season athlete with anterior shoulder dislocation was conducted of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The findings are summarized in this article.

Results

Multiple studies have investigated management of the in-season athlete with anterior shoulder dislocation. Treatment is highly individualized for each athlete and their respective circumstances. Nonoperative treatment remains the only option for athletes that seek to return to play in the same season, however with a high risk of recurrence. Operative treatment has a track record of success in terms of returning to high level of play and lower recurrence, but would preclude a return to competition in the same season.

Conclusions

Management of the in-season athlete with anterior shoulder dislocation remains a challenging issue without consensus recommendation among shoulder surgeons. Much has been done to understand the pathology and delineate indications for nonoperative treatment and surgical management. Although recurrence and return to play rates have improved with each iteration, recurrent instability and revision surgery continue to occur at high rates. Therefore, additional work remains to optimize return to play as well as long-term outcomes for athletes.

### Treatment of hip dislocations and associated injuries: current state of care [^1156Dqrn]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hip dislocations, most often caused by motor vehicle accidents or similar high-energy trauma, traverse a large subset of distinct injury patterns. Understanding these patterns and their associated injuries allows surgeons to provide optimal care for these patients both in the early and late postinjury periods. Nonoperative care requires surgeons to understand the indications. Surgical care requires the surgeon to understand the benefits and limitations of several surgical approaches. This article presents the current understanding of hip dislocation treatment, focusing on anatomy, injury classifications, nonoperative and operative management, and postinjury care.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114ib8mi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and compare treatments (1) after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation aimed at minimising the risk of chronic shoulder instability and (2) for chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability.

Design

Intervention systematic review with random effects network meta-analysis and direct comparison meta-analyses.

Data sources

Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, DARE, HTA, NHSEED, Web of Science) and reference lists were searched from inception to 15 January 2018.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised trials comparing any interventions either after a first-time, traumatic shoulder dislocation or chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, with a shoulder instability, function or quality of life outcome.

Results

Twenty-two randomised controlled trials were included. There was moderate quality evidence suggesting that labrum repair reduced the risk of future shoulder dislocation (relative risk 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.8, p = 0.026), and that with non-surgical management 47% of patients did not experience shoulder redislocation. Very low to low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation. There was low-quality evidence that an open procedure was superior to arthroscopic surgery for preventing shoulder redislocations.

Conclusions

There was moderate-quality evidence that half of the patients managed with physiotherapy after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation did not experience recurrent shoulder dislocations. If chronic instability develops, surgery could be considered. There was no evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgical management for post-traumatic chronic shoulder instability.

### Knee joint dislocations-current epidemiology and treatment in Germany [^111tkQaW]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A knee joint dislocation occurs when there is a complete disruption of the tibiofemoral joint, leading to the dislocation of the tibia from the femur. This rare injury is characterized by its high potential for concomitant damage to the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve, which can result in limb‐threatening ischaemia and long‐term functional impairment if not promptly addressed.

General risk factors for knee joint dislocations include sports, motor vehicle collisions, falls from significant heights and occupations involving heavy physical labour. Furthermore, obesity is a risk factor for low‐velocity knee dislocations and a predictor of poorer outcomes.

The management of knee joint dislocations typically involves urgent reduction of the dislocation to restore joint alignment, followed by a thorough assessment of vascular and neurological status. Treatment approaches can vary from nonoperative methods, such as external braces and physical therapy, to surgical interventions aimed at repairing or reconstructing the injured ligaments and addressing any neurovascular injuries. In patients following knee arthroplasty, revision surgery with exchange of the prosthesis and implantation of a rotating hinge total‐knee prosthesis is the most common treatment.

This study aims to provide detailed information about the epidemiology and incidence of knee joint dislocations in Germany over the years 2019–2022 and an overview of current treatment practices.

### Conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder [^117KRYhh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute anterior dislocation, which is the most common type of shoulder dislocation, usually results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to re-dislocation, especially in active young adults. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2013), EMBASE (1980 to Week 38, 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September 2013), PEDro (1929 to November 2012), OTseeker (inception to November 2012) and trial registries. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing various conservative interventions versus control (no or sham treatment) or other conservative interventions applied after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Results of comparable groups of trials were pooled.

Main Results

We included three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial, which involved 470 participants (371 male) with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods. Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers. All trials were at some risk of bias but to a differing extent. One was at high risk in all domains of the risk of bias tool, and one was at unclear or high risk in all domains; the other two trials were deemed to have predominantly low risk across all domains. Overall, reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be "very low" for all outcomes, meaning that we are very uncertain about the estimates of effect. The four trials evaluated the same comparison - immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation - and each of our three primary outcomes (re-dislocation, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for shoulder instability and resumption of activities) was reported by one or more of the trials, with two-year or longer follow-up. Pooling was possible for "re-dislocation" (three trials) and for aspects of "resumption of sport/activities at pre-injury level" (two trials). There was no evidence to show a difference between the two groups in re-dislocation at two-year or longer follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06 favouring internal rotation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.54; P value 0.77; 252 participants; three trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 247 re-dislocations per 1000, these data equate to 15 more (95% CI 67 fewer to 133 more) re-dislocations per 1000 after immobilisation in external rotation. In a medium-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 436 re-dislocations per 1000, the data equate to 26 more (95% CI 118 fewer to 235 more) re-dislocations after immobilisation in external rotation. Nor was evidence found to show a difference between the two groups in return to pre-injury levels of activity at two-year or longer follow-up (RR 1.25 favouring external rotation, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.2; P value 0.43; 278 participants; two trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 204 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 41 more (95% CI 59 fewer to 245 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation. In a high-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 605 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 161 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 395 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation. One trial reported that the difference between the two groups in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index scores, analysed using non-parametric statistics, was "not significant (P = 0.32)". Of our secondary outcomes, pooling was possible for "any instability" (two trials) and for important adverse events (three events, two trials). However, adverse event data were collected only in an ad hoc way, and it is unclear whether identification and reporting of such events was comprehensive. No report addressed participant satisfaction or health-related quality of life outcome measures. There was no evidence confirming a difference between the two positions of immobilisation in any of the primary or secondary outcomes; for each outcome, the confidence intervals were wide, covering the possibility of substantial benefit for each intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Numerous conservative strategies may be adopted after closed reduction of a traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder, and many warrant investigation. However, our review reveals that evidence from randomised controlled trials is only available for a single approach: immobilisation in external rotation versus immobilisation in the traditional position of internal rotation. Moreover, this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate whether immobilisation in external rotation confers any benefit over immobilisation in internal rotation. We identified six unpublished trials and two ongoing trials that compare immobilisation in external versus internal rotation. Given this, the main priority for research on this question consists of the publication of completed trials, and the completion and publication of ongoing trials. Meanwhile, increased attention to other interventions is required. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well reported randomised controlled trials with long-term surveillance should be conducted to examine the optimum duration of immobilisation, whether immobilisation is necessary at all (in older age groups particularly), which rehabilitative interventions work best and the acceptability to participants of different care strategies.

### Acute management of shoulder dislocations [^1151aYXf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

The shoulder joint has the greatest range of motion of any joint in the body. However, it relies on soft-tissue restraints, including the capsule, ligaments, and musculature, for stability. Therefore, this joint is at the highest risk for dislocation. Thorough knowledge of the shoulder's anatomy as well as classification of dislocations, anesthetic techniques, and reduction maneuvers is crucial for early management of acute shoulder dislocation. Given the lack of comparative studies on various reduction techniques, the choice of technique is based on physician preference. The orthopaedic surgeon must be well versed in several reduction methods and ascertain the best technique for each patient.

### Editorial commentary: natural history of shoulder dislocation-is recurrence our only metric? [^116tjwUZ]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The natural history of a traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation has been the subject of significant study, often with differing results depending on the population studied. Most studies have focused on recurrent dislocation as the primary outcome of interest, whereas metrics such as subluxation, return to athletics, and patient-reported outcome scores are also available in limited studies. The known risk factors for recurrence include young age and male gender. Surgical stabilization should be considered in populations at higher risk of recurrence and has been shown in Level I studies to result in reduction of recurrence and improvement in patient-reported outcomes.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114hCkoG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We performed meta-analyses of clinically homogenous studies (patient populations, indications of treatment, intervention pairs and outcomes). If studies with same intervention-control pairs were not sufficiently homogenous, we performed multiple pairwise meta-analyses of the trials with poolable patients and data. In the analysis of surgical treatment after first-time shoulder dislocation, we performed a frequentist network meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment alternatives at matching time points available in the source data. We prioritised outcomes at 2 years since the majority of shoulder redislocations take place within that time. If a trial had reported outcomes at multiple time points, we used data from one time point only in a single analysis. We calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH)for interventions with dichotomous outcomes and statistically significant between-group comparisons. For shoulder redislocations, the NNT is the number of patients who need to receive a treatment to prevent one patient having a shoulder redislocation. The NNH is the number of patients who need to be treated in a certain way to cause a redislocation. For NNT estimates we used the point estimate of the relevant risk ratio, base redislocation risk from a systematic review (21%–47%, minimum follow-up of 2 years)and the redislocation rates in the relevant included trials.

### Surgery for patellar dislocation has evolved towards anatomical reconstructions with assessment and treatment of anatomical risk factors [^117ArvXN]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lateral patellar dislocation is a common knee injury in the young, active population. Indeed, previous studies have found the incidence of acute patellar dislocation to be between 23 and 77 per 100,000 person-years, depending on the demographics of the target population. Peak incidence, estimated to be 148 per 100,000 person-years, occurs between the ages of 14 and 18. The incidence has been shown to decline with age. Among the female population, this decline begins at an earlier age (14–18 years) than among the male population (19–25 years). According to the findings of a 10-year follow-up study, 23% of patients with patellar dislocation suffered a recurrent dislocation. The risk of recurrent dislocation is even higher in skeletally immature patients, among whom the incidence of recurrence during a 10-year follow-up study was reported to be 45%.

Based on clinical experience, primary acute patellar dislocation is generally treated conservatively. However, in cases of osteochondral fracture, where a loose fragment of bone is detected inside the knee joint, surgery is the first-line treatment. If patellar dislocation recurs, surgical patellar stabilisation may be indicated. At present, however, consensus on the best treatment recommendations and guidelines for primary patellar dislocation is lacking. A recent meta-analysis by Yang et al. comprising 16 randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cohort studies published between 1986 and 2018 cautiously concluded that surgical treatment might also be more favourable than conservative treatment for patients with their first patellar dislocation. This conclusion was based on the finding that surgically treated patients had higher Kujala scores (anterior knee-specific patient-reported outcomes) and a lower rate of re-dislocations compared with conservatively treated patients. Nevertheless, due to the rapid development of surgical techniques during the past few decades, the conclusion was based on heterogenous study populations. Previous results have indicated that not all surgical techniques are as equally effective.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate trends in the surgical treatment of patellar dislocations between the years 1997 and 2016 using nationwide data from the Finnish population-based register of medical treatment. The hypothesis was that an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of patellar instability has led to an increase in the popularity of the reconstruction of damaged structures and the modification of anatomical risk factors. Moreover, knowledge on current trends in the surgical treatment of patellar dislocation in relation to recent research may provide an important insight into the future prospects of different approaches to the surgical management of patellar dislocation.

### The trapezium dislocation: case presentation, review of the literature, radiographic analysis, proposed classification, and treatment [^114Xd8Pt]. Hand (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Trapezium dislocations are rare injuries.

Methods

A PubMed search of the term "trapezium dislocation" was conducted. Publications reporting a complete trapezium dislocation were included in the review.

Results

The PubMed search resulted in 168 results. Fourteen publications reporting on 16 complete trapezium dislocations met inclusion criteria. A case of delayed diagnosis of a trapezium dislocation is presented. The literature is reviewed for pertinent clinically relevant information with respect to trapezium dislocations. A systematic method for radiographic analysis of trapezium dislocations and classification are described, and a treatment algorithm is presented.

Conclusions

Trapezium dislocations are infrequent injuries with few cases reported in the literature. Given the rarity of this injury, diagnosis and appropriate treatment may be delayed due to difficulty in recognition. Using the described method of radiographic analysis, delayed diagnosis may be avoided with implementation of timely treatment.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^115gAWse]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

We categorised the included publications according to the two clinical scenarios under review (first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation and chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability). We extracted the outcome data for all available follow-up assessments. For primary shoulder dislocation, we used redislocation data from 1-year and 2-year follow-ups as defined in the individual studies. If numeric outcome data were unavailable, we extracted the data from figures and graphs.

In addition to the outcome measures, we extracted the following information regarding the trial characteristics and participants: study objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of patients allocated to intervention and control groups, follow-up time, sex distribution, mean age, proportion of sports injuries, indications for surgery, treatments for the intervention and control groups, associated soft-tissue and bony injuries, prespecified and reported harms, sample size estimations, study sponsorships and conflict of interest statements and trial registry identifiers. We extracted the method of randomisation and randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment, degrees of blinding, loss to follow-up, intention-to-treat analysis, selective reporting, similarity of patient groups, cointerventions, compliance and timing of the outcome assessment. All data were extracted to a customised worksheet independently by two reviewers (LK and TL). We sent emails to authors of potentially eligible conference abstracts, publications with no available source data and unpublished trials and inquired about the status of the trial and requested data to be included in the meta-analyses.

### Glenohumeral dislocation arthropathy: etiology, diagnosis, and management [^117BYdPD]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Dislocation arthropathy describes the development of progressive degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint in the setting of instability. Although the specific etiology remains unclear, the trauma of a single dislocation, repetitive injury associated with recurrent dislocations, changes in shoulder biomechanics, and complications associated with instability surgery have all been implicated in its development. Pain and restricted range of motion are the most common patient complaints. Conservative management, consisting of pain control, activity modification, and physical therapy, is the first-line treatment after the development of arthropathy. If conservative management fails, multiple surgical options exist. Arthroscopic débridement can be attempted in young, active patients and in those patients with mild-to-moderate arthropathy. Open subscapularis lengthening and capsular release can be done in patients with prior instability repairs that are overly tight. In young patients with minimal bone loss and glenoid wear, surface replacement arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty are surgical options. In older patients with moderate-to-severe arthropathy, total shoulder or reverse shoulder arthroplasty is the preferred treatment option. Further study is needed to better predict which patients will develop dislocation arthropathy and will thus benefit from early surgical intervention.

### Comparison of tetradecyl sulfate versus polidocanol injections for stabilisation of joints that regularly dislocate in an Ehlers-Danlos population [^1131Dwiv]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

What are the new findings?

While there are studies on the use of tetradecyl sulfate and polidocanol in soft tissues, there are no studies to date on the use of these agents in treating chronic and recurrent dislocations in the Ehlers-Danlos population, or any population, other than for temporomandibular joints.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Before being added to routine care tetradecyl sulfate will need to be studied in other trials with randomised controlled trial designs. A successful treatment could impact on the lives of tens of thousands of people with EDS internationally who are chronic sufferers from chronic and recurrent dislocating joints.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: the ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^1173eWzh]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite a huge number of publications in the field of patellofemoral instability, relatively few studies with high scientific level exist, and many open questions remain. This is where a consensus project based upon a strict scientific methodology can provide valuable guidance and recommendations for general orthopaedic surgeons, orthopaedic specialists, trauma surgeons and also be relevant for physiotherapists. The purpose of this method is to combine scientific evidence and expert opinions in the field and to obtain this peer‐reviewed conclusion with the highest level of agreement. This can be useful as a guideline for everyone working in this field.

Given that there are region‐specific differences in health systems throughout Europe, a consensus cannot fully respect all these local aspects. However, owing to the strict methodology, this approach provides an 'ideal' model for a diagnostic or therapeutic approach and has the potential to be widely implemented throughout Europe.

FTPD is the starting point of every instance of patellar instability, and either it is a single event or it is followed by recurrent dislocations or subluxations with or without pain. Even ongoing symptoms such as patellofemoral pain or a limitation of knee‐related quality of life can be expected. The risk factors for FTPD have been substantially investigated and are well established, and they do not differ from those of chronic cases. There are anatomical risk factors and others such as age, hyperlaxity and the level of force causing the patella to dislocate (trauma intensity) (see Table 1).

Table 1
Risk factors for FTPD.

Establishing and proposing an optimal individualized treatment for a patient is influenced by many factors. The patient's medical history (e.g. intensity of trauma leading to FTPD and bilateral instability), as well as one or more predisposal factors and the patient's demands must also be considered when a therapeutic strategy is being planned. Therefore, the aetiology of FTPD is considered extremely important, and decision‐making must be individualized and not based exclusively on clinical or radiological measurements.

Interestingly, there are more open questions about FTPD than about chronic cases. Despite the clear definition of FTPD, the clinical question of whether to treat this disease surgically remained unsolved. Essential questions and statements on this topic were developed by The ESSKA committee for patellar instability to combine the available literature and clinical experience.

Part I focused on clinical presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, evaluation, imaging and complications. Part II focused on nonoperative treatment, bracing, rehabilitation, indications and surgical strategies.

### Editorial commentary: operative treatment of primary patellar dislocation [^112NXN44]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Systematic review of the literature does not support operative treatment of primary patellar dislocation, as the results of nonoperative treatment are similar. However, surgery is indicated for recurrent patellar dislocation, and in the future, we anticipate that contemporary medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction outcomes for primary patellar dislocation will prove superior to nonoperative treatment.

### Return to sport after surgical treatment for high-grade (rockwood III-VI) acromioclavicular dislocation [^112DD2L3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are common in young athletes with an incidence of 9.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of AC injuries is higher in contact sports and is highest in adults in their 20s. Full recovery with return to pre-injury level of sports and minimal time lost to injury is essential in the treatment of these injuries.

The Rockwood classification is most commonly used for classifying AC joint injuries according to the severity. Most type I and II dislocations are treated conservatively. For type IV to VI AC joint dislocations, surgical treatment generally is the intervention of choice. The optimal management of type III AC joint dislocations remains controversial. A trend is set toward initial non-surgical treatment, unless non-surgical treatment fails in patients with persistent pain or the inability to return to sport or work.

Many surgical techniques have been described for the repair of AC joint dislocations. When evaluating surgical treatment, existing literature mainly measures functionality with outcome scores or self-reported outcome measures. Limited literature exists about the rate of return to sport in this population. However, return to sport has been found to be a good indicator of success after treatment for injuries to the musculoskeletal body. Analyzing the rate of return to sport could provide surgeons and patients with relevant outcome information to optimize shared decision making. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the rate of return to sport after surgical intervention in high-grade AC dislocation (Rockwood III–VI), to help surgeons address patient expectations. In contrast to the existing literature on this topic, the present review aims to combine outcomes of sports-practicing patients of studies with larger sample sizes and more recent studies with higher levels of evidence.

### The recognition and treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation in active individuals [^1127jq8c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Anterior shoulder dislocation occurs in the general population; however, the incidence is doubled in the young athletic population. Over 90% of shoulder dislocations are in the anterior direction. For the first-time dislocation, a systematic approach to evaluating the patient and prompt reduction are critical. This injury is frequently witnessed on the field or later in the emergency department. On the field, closed reductions, without prereduction radiographs, is controversial. If the athlete is encountered in the emergency department, radiographs should be obtained prior to a closed reduction. After a closed reduction is achieved, several factors, such as timing in the season, type of sport, position, and patient goals, must be considered when deciding whether further surgical intervention is required. Conservative management will usually consist of a brief period of immobilization in a sling, followed by rehabilitation. Surgical treatment consists of an arthroscopic Bankart repair.

### Pavlik harness disease revisited: does prolonged treatment of a dislocated hip in a harness adversely affect the α angle? [^115QMTdW]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common developmental deformities of the lower extremities, as well as one of the leading causes of early arthritis and total hip replacement. First-line therapy is most often the Pavlik harness, which has a reported rate of successful reduction of 63% to 93% for Ortolani-positive hips.–Although hips typically stabilize within 3 to 4 weeks of initial Pavlik harness application, those that fail to achieve a stable reduction within this timeframe may be at increased risk for "Pavlik harness disease". First defined by Jones et al, Pavlik harness disease is "prolonged positioning of the dislocated hip in flexion and abduction that potentiates dysplasia, particularly of the posterolateral acetabulum, and increases the difficulty of obtaining a stable closed reduction". As a consequence, prolonged harness use in the setting of a persistent dislocation is thought to result in a greater proportion of patients requiring open reduction. It has thus become dogma to abandon harness treatment after 2 to 4 weeks if a hip remains unstable.–

To our knowledge, however, no studies have documented objective morphologic changes to the acetabulum over time in response to continued treatment of an irreducible or unstable hip. Instead, the evidence in support of Pavlik harness disease originates from several small case series describing observational evidence of posterolateral acetabular insufficiency and surrogate markers such as increased rates of open reduction. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the acetabular α angle (AA) deteriorates with prolonged treatment of a dislocated hip with a Pavlik harness, and to determine the clinical outcome of those hips that fail prolonged harness therapy.

### Posterior shoulder dislocation: systematic review and treatment algorithm [^112zFmpu]. Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Posterior shoulder dislocations (PSDs) comprise a small subset of shoulder dislocations, and there are few evidence-based treatment protocols and no actual algorithm for the treatment of PSDs available in the literature. This article provides a systematic review of the literature, as well as an overview of clinical and radiologic diagnostic techniques, and presents an algorithm for treatment of PSDs, including minimally invasive treatment options.

Methods

For a systematic review of current literature, a systematic search was performed in the Medline and Cochrane databases. Journal articles published between January 1940 and June 2010 were taken into account. Studies that only existed as abstracts were not included in the analysis. Broad exclusion criteria consisted of radiologic reports, review articles, case reports, and technical notes. Refined exclusion criteria consisted of a minimum of 4 patients with PSDs operated on by the same surgical technique and clinical outcome documented by a functional shoulder score.

Results

The final set of articles for evaluating closed or open techniques included 5 prospective case series and 6 retrospective studies. Within this group, there was no study with a level of evidence higher than Level IV. We present a descriptive comparison of these studies because of the heterogeneity and/or number of patients and the level of evidence. Case reports illustrate the different surgical approaches according to the literature.

Conclusions

PSDs are still a challenge for the treating physician. There are few articles available about PSDs in evidence-based literature, with a limited number of cases. Our algorithm provides guidelines for decision making including minimally invasive treatment options according to the available literature.

### Conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder [^116gX9wo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute anterior dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation and usually results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and more susceptible to redislocation, especially in active young adults.

Objectives

To compare methods of conservative (non-surgical) management versus no treatment or different methods of conservative management after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Interventions include methods of postreduction immobilisation and rehabilitation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register (UK), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing various conservative interventions versus control (no or sham treatment) or other conservative interventions applied after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

Data Collection and Analysis

All authors selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

One flawed quasi-randomised trial was included. A "preliminary report" gave the results for 40 adults with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder treated by post-reduction immobilisation with the arm in either external or internal rotation. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the failure to return to pre-injury sports by previously active athletes, in redislocation or shoulder instability. Similar numbers of participants of the two groups removed their immobiliser before one week had passed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well reported randomised controlled trials with long-term surveillance of conservative management are required. In particular, trials examining the type and duration of immobilisation would be useful.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^112E3nxx]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results

The literature search yielded 2867 reports after exclusion of duplicates. Of these reports, 55 were considered for inclusion after review of titles and abstracts (figure 1). After full-text review, 25 publications (22 RCTs) were included (figure 1). Studies excluded at the full-text screening stage are presented in online supplementary appendix table 1. We identified six unpublished RCTs (online supplementary appendix table 2). Five of these explored external rotation (ER) versus internal rotation (IR) as a treatment for a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. We did not receive data of any trial. We identified 20 ongoing RCTs (online supplementary appendix table 3).

Figure 1
Study accrual flow chart.

Of the 22 included RCTs, 10 investigated treatment after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. Four studied whether early surgery was beneficial after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation, and five compared the effect of upper limb immobilisation in ER versus IR in preventing further instability. Twelve RCTs focused on chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, of which four RCTs compared open labral repair with arthroscopic labral repairand three compared absorbable with non-absorbable suture anchors.

Mean participant age ranged from 20.3 to 36 years. The mean follow-up ranged from 12 to 143 months. In 15 RCTs, 67% of the primary dislocations were sports injuries; seven RCTs did not report injury mechanism. One study included patients with large bony defects of the glenoid. The trials are summarised in table 1; online supplementary appendix tables 4 and 5 present all extracted data.

### Editorial commentary: a Delphi expert consensus provides clarity on diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and return-to-sports for posterior shoulder instability [^113WWLqH]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Posterior shoulder instability (PSI) is an uncommon condition, accounting for 2% to 12% of shoulder instability cases. However, PSI might be more common and possibly accounts for up to 24% of all young, active patients treated for shoulder instability. The etiology of PSI is complex and multifactorial, making accurate diagnosis, classification, and treatment challenging. The accurate diagnosis of PSI is problematic and varies with symptoms ranging from pain, decreased strength, or endurance to mechanical symptoms such as clicking or popping, and only a minority of patients present after a posterior shoulder dislocation. Appropriate imaging is necessary and should include radiographs and advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, preferably magnetic resonance arthrography. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, improve function, and prevent or reduce recurrence. Both surgical and conservative treatments are demanding, and both osseous and soft-tissue pathologies need to be addressed adequately. Typically, a conservative approach should be considered first for the first 6 months, with a focus on proprioceptive exercises, strengthening of the dynamic stabilizers, and improving scapulothoracic mechanics. The primary indication for surgery is recurrent symptoms. Controversies exist regarding the choice between open and arthroscopic stabilization of soft-tissue defects, the treatment of the McLaughlin lesion, and the management of osseous defects.

### Treatment type may influence degree of post-dislocation shoulder osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zJtuS]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

To assess the severity of OA following a shoulder dislocation, multiple classification methods have been proposed. Using plain radiography, these methods generally consist of four or five grades of OA severity ranging from "no OA" to "severe OA". Severity is determined by joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes. Long-term degrees of OA for other orthopedic pathologies, such as knee osteoarthritis following an anterior cruciate ligament defect, have been well described. However, it remains unclear if the treatment type for anterior shoulder instability influences degree of OA. If the degree of OA is influenced by treatment type in any way, it can assist both clinicians and patients in the decision-making process.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of OA at long-term follow-up after non-operative and operative treatment for patients with anterior shoulder instability. Surgery is indicated when patients experience recurrence and this is associated with OA; therefore, it was hypothesized that shoulders show a higher proportion or degree of OA following operative treatment compared to non-operative treatment.

### Management of acute anterior shoulder dislocation [^115tR9qN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Shoulder dislocation is the most common large joint dislocation in the body. Recent advances in radiological imaging and shoulder surgery have shown the potential dangers of traditional reduction techniques such as the Kocher's and the Hippocratic methods, which are still advocated by many textbooks. Many non-specialists continue to use these techniques, unaware of their potential risks. This article reviews the clinical and radiographic presentation of dislocation; some common reduction techniques; their risks and success rate; analgesia methods to facilitate the reduction; and postreduction management. Many textbooks advocate methods that have been superceded by safer alternatives. Trainees should learn better and safer relocation methods backed up by the current evidence available.

### Treatment type may influence degree of post-dislocation shoulder osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YXSj4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

General risk factors for development of osteoarthritis (OA) include genetic predisposition, female gender, old age, and trauma. OA of the shoulder can be painful, and lead to a decrease in range of motion, limiting shoulder function, which may lead to shoulder arthroplasty as an intervention to treat the pain and reduce the limitations. Studies have shown a higher degree of OA following anterior shoulder dislocation and stabilization surgery compared to the contralateral healthy shoulder. A shoulder dislocation is a commonly established diagnosis at the emergency department, with a reported incidence of 23.9 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of an anterior shoulder dislocation decreases with age, is higher in males than in females, and is higher when participating in contact and overhead sports in comparison to other types of sports. When the patient experiences (recurrent) instability that affects activities of daily living, work, or sports participation, an operative stabilization procedure is indicated. Several stabilization procedures have been proposed, ranging from soft-tissue procedures to bony augmentation procedures. A soft-tissue procedure, such as the Bankart repair, is usually indicated when little glenoid bone loss is present. A bony augmentation procedure, for example a Latarjet procedure or an Iliac crest bone graft procedure, is usually indicated in case of extensive damage to the glenohumeral joint or excessive glenoid bone loss. Both soft-tissue and bone augmentation procedures can be performed arthroscopically or with an open procedure. Plath et al. showed that an arthroscopic Bankart procedure resulted in similar long-term OA rates compared to an open procedure and non-operative treatment. Age at primary dislocation, recurrence, and glenoid bone loss are associated with development of OA. However, it is unclear to what degree type of surgery is associated with development of OA in comparison to non-operative treatment. In addition, a patient will gain relatively more stability following a bone augmentation procedure in comparison to a soft-tissue procedure. To what degree this is associated with development of OA is unclear as well.

### Knee joint dislocations-current epidemiology and treatment in Germany [^117LDywd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology, incidence and treatment of knee dislocations in Germany, with a focus on demographic risk factors, treatment complexities and the impact of obesity and knee prostheses. The findings emphasize the importance of specialized care in larger hospitals, comprehensive management of concomitant injuries and the need for improved coding accuracy. Future research should aim to refine treatment protocols.

### Conservative treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation with the arm in external rotation [^113NSXLt]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Nonoperative treatment of traumatic first-time shoulder dislocation has remained the same for a long time. The recurrence rate of nonoperative treatment is unacceptably high, especially in young and active patients. In an earlier study, we demonstrated the superiority of immobilization in external rotation over conventional treatment. Arthroscopic stabilization is being increasingly recommended after a first-time dislocation; however, surgical stabilization after a first-time dislocation still remains controversial. In this paper, we introduce a basic study that provides evidence for the development of immobilization in external rotation, recent clinical outcomes, and future perspective. Furthermore, how to choose the treatment options for first-time dislocations is discussed.

### Management of shoulder dislocation – are we doing enough to reduce the risk of recurrence? [^114yWMjz]. Injury (2002). Low credibility.

Young patients with shoulder dislocation are at high risk of recurrence. Traditionally, management has been conservative, but rehabilitative programmes are successful in fewer than 20% of patients. Recent studies suggest that early surgical intervention (arthroscopic lavage or stabilisation) can significantly reduce recurrence in young patients with primary traumatic anterior dislocation. This study demonstrated that in our region, 21% of all patients presenting with shoulder dislocation had already suffered recurrence at 1 year; in the 15–22 years age group this figure was 43%. We propose to offer young patients presenting with primary traumatic anterior dislocations arthroscopic lavage within 10 days of injury. The extra surgical workload is manageable within our current trauma service arrangements, and we believe that this form of treatment would be acceptable to patients.

### Primary ligament sutures as a treatment option of knee dislocations: a meta-analysis [^113ZQhYB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Knee joint dislocation is rare and accounts for only approximately 0.02% of all musculoskeletal injuries. Most published studies include only a small number of cases. Therefore, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking and treatment options are controversial. The incongruence of study populations can lead to difficulties when comparing studies. Because of the lack of homogeneity in the injury pattern after knee dislocations, multiple therapeutic regimens have been recommended. Non-operative treatment of knee dislocation leads to poor short- and long-term outcomes and is no longer recommended. Two-stage management of multiple knee ligament injuries is widely accepted. According to the 2-stage regimen, medial and/or lateral collateral ligament sutures are performed within 8–10 days of injury, followed by reconstruction of the anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments after 6–8 weeks. Good clinical outcome has been demonstrated in 70% of patients undergoing a 2-stage procedure. A meta-analysis by Levy et al. found significantly better results in patients undergoing autologous tendon reconstruction of cruciate ligaments compared with patients undergoing suture repair.

The major problems of most published studies on knee joint dislocations are as follows: (1) no sufficient differentiation between acute and chronic injuries and (2) the lack of correlation of clinical outcome with injury pattern and surgical treatment. Some studies perform suture repairs of the collateral ligaments without reconstruction. Others perform additional sutures of only one cruciate ligament. Existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews did not perform individual analyses or account for injury patterns. Moreover, specifications about which ligaments have been treated by sutures are absent. No information can be found about untreated isolated structures (e.g. ACL or PCL).

This study was initiated based on the lack of homogeneity in the most recent literature. Our goal was to provide more detailed information about treatment options for knee dislocations based on a meta-analysis of clinical outcome with respect to injury pattern and performed treatment. In particular, this study focused on the clinical results of anatomical suture repair of cruciate ligaments in knee joint dislocation versus reconstruction of the ACL and PCL.

### Anterior glenohumeral joint dislocations [^114T1hvk]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The glenohumeral joint is the most mobile articulation in the body and the most commonly dislocated diarthroidal joint. Anterior dislocation is by far the most common direction and can lead to instability of the glenohumeral joint, which ranges from subtle increased laxity to recurrent dislocation. Overtime, understanding of anterior shoulder dislocations and the resulting instability has improved. Likewise, significant advances in arthroscopic equipment have allowed use of the arthroscope to address anatomically the various lesions that cause instability. This article reviews the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment of anterior shoulder instability.

### Traumatic thumb carpometacarpal joint dislocations [^114LUJfL]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Isolated traumatic dislocation of the thumb carpometacarpal joint, also called the trapeziometacarpal joint, is a rare injury. Controversy still exists concerning which ligaments are the true key stabilizers for the joint and therefore need to be damaged to result in dislocation, and optimal treatment strategies for thumb carpometacarpal joint dislocations are the subject of continuing debate. We give a review of the literature concerning traumatic dislocations of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb and propose a treatment algorithm.

### Arthroscopic treatment of traumatic hip dislocation [^1151AZS4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic hip dislocations are high-energy injuries that often result in considerable morbidity. Although appropriate management improves outcomes, associated hip pathology may complicate the recovery and lead to future disability and pain. Historically, open reduction has been the standard of care for treating hip dislocations that require surgical intervention. The use of hip arthroscopy to treat the sequelae and symptoms resulting from traumatic hip dislocations recently has increased, however. When used appropriately, hip arthroscopy is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment option for intra-articular pathology secondary to traumatic hip dislocation.

### Posterior shoulder dislocations and fracture-dislocations [^112yeomC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Posterior shoulder dislocations and fracture-dislocations are uncommon injuries that most often occur during seizures or as a result of high-energy trauma. Despite advances in imaging, they are frequently diagnosed late. Detection is facilitated by heightened clinical suspicion of the injury in high-risk individuals together with appropriate radiographic investigation. A wide variety of operative techniques, ranging from simple closed reduction to soft-tissue and bone stabilization procedures to prosthetic arthroplasty, are available to treat these injuries. Selection of the most appropriate treatment option is complex and multifactorial. Because of the rarity of these injuries, evidence-based treatment protocols are difficult to devise. Good functional outcomes are associated with early detection and treatment of isolated posterior dislocations that are associated with a small osseous defect and are stable following closed reduction. Poor prognostic factors include late diagnosis, a large anterior defect in the humeral head, deformity or arthrosis of the humeral head, an associated fracture of the proximal part of the humerus, and the need for an arthroplasty.

### Long-term follow-up (14 to 25 years) following closed reduction and early movement for simple dislocation of the elbow [^112LQiWj]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

The treatment for a simple dislocation of the elbow is generally accepted to be a short period of immobilization followed by early movement. Patient outcomes with this approach are generally reported to be excellent, although there is good evidence that the outcomes are not entirely benign. We performed a previous study that showed that a large number of patients reported some persistent pain following this nonoperative treatment protocol, although the pain was usually self-limiting and did not necessarily translate to further treatment. A smaller number of these patients reported symptoms of persistent instability, and it has been shown that prolonged immobilization is associated with an increased risk of elbow contracture and stiffness.

Despite the general consensus regarding nonoperative treatment of most simple elbow dislocations, there has been continued debate about which injuries might benefit from early surgery and which simple dislocations of the elbow are best treated with primary ligamentous repair. It has been suggested that subclinical instability may contribute to later pain, loss of function, and degenerative changes, and this may be a reason to advocate early surgery for patients with simple elbow dislocations, particularly those with high demands.

We performed the present study to assess the extended outcomes for patients with a simple elbow dislocation who had been treated with a protocol that involved a short period of immobilization followed by early movement. We undertook this extended follow-up study to determine if the favorable early to midterm outcomes reported in the earlier study, and more generally in the literature, were maintained over time and into the very long term. We hypothesized that patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), range of movement, and satisfaction would be preserved and would not show time-related deterioration. Our secondary hypothesis was that the rates of and need for late or delayed surgical intervention would be low.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114ZXhGq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

The use of shoulder instability-validated outcome instruments was rareand baseline values were seldom reported. The publications also generally did not meet the assumptions of the power calculations, making a type II error possible. Another limitation is publication bias in the field, as studies with 'negative results' for the intervention are more likely to remain unpublished, risking overestimation of the true effect in meta-analyses. A methodological limitation is that no sensitivity analyses or meta-regression were performed. Finally, our findings apply only to patients with almost intact bony glenoids, as in all but one trial no marked bony defects of the glenoid were present among the patients. This has direct clinical relevance as shoulder dislocation occasionally causes a sizeable glenoid fracture, or the glenoid bone may erode with numerous redislocations.

A limitation to the clinical relevance of our findings is that the effect of a shoulder redislocation on patient quality of life remains unclear. An occasional shoulder dislocation may result in mild discomfort while the shoulder functions otherwise normally. In contrast, a subjectively unstable shoulder may be associated with constant fear of dislocations, kinesiophobia and poor function even in the absence of redislocations. If the primary treatment aim was to prevent redislocations only, shoulder arthrodesis would be very effective. However, such a treatment would also likely be associated with poor functional outcomes, and we might reasonably expect this treatment and outcome is not desired by patients.

### What is the best evidence for the treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis? [^114h3xMZ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are many different treatment methods for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). It was the purpose of this study to review the results from the literature for different methods of SCFE treatment and on the basis of level of evidence determine the current best evidence treatment.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Treatment results were grouped into 2 categories. The first was all methods without surgical hip dislocation, and the second was all methods in which surgical dislocation was used.

Results

For stable SCFEs without surgical dislocation, the best recommended treatment (mostly level IV) recommends in situ single screw fixation over multiple pin fixation, epiphysiodesis, osteotomy, or spica cast. For the unstable SCFEs without surgical dislocation (all level IV), the best recommended treatment is urgent reduction with decompression and internal fixation. For both stable and unstable SCFEs, the short-term small series in the literature (all level IV) does not demonstrate an advantage or improvement in outcomes compared with in situ single screw fixation for stable SCFE and urgent reduction, decompression, and internal fixation in unstable SCFEs.

Conclusions

A systematic review of the literature recommends on the basis of level of evidence that the best treatment for a stable SCFE is single screw in situ fixation and for unstable SCFEs urgent gentle reduction, decompression, and internal fixation.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of level IV studies.

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^111THXMq]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint are quite common, accounting for 3–12% of all shoulder injuries. The incidence even rises up to 40–50% when it comes to contact sports, with the highest prevalence in men in their second or third decade of life. It seems evident that diagnosis and management of acute and chronic AC joint dislocations need to be well stated. However, although a plethora literature is available, a clear consensus has still not been achieved.

Traditionally, AC joint dislocations have been diagnosed on radiographs, through bilateral standard anteroposterior (AP) and Zanca views, and then classified according to the Rockwood classification. Conservative management is usually preferred in low-grade injuries (Rockwood type I and II), whereas symptomatic high-grade injuries (types IV–VI) are routinely managed surgically. Management of acute type III injuries is still an ongoing subject of controversy. Decision making is often based on patient's work and sporting activity as well as surgeon's personal opinion and experience. However, concerns have been raised on each step of the decision-making process. Even when it comes to conservative management, best type and length of immobilization have not been defined yet. Regarding surgical therapy, the wide range of available new surgical procedures clearly reflects the lacking of a golden standard; each technique is associated with limitations and, finally, none of them have been demonstrated to be superior to the others with respect to clinical outcomes.

Therefore, the European Shoulder Associates (ESA), section of the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA), aimed to develop a consensus on the evaluation and management of AC joint dislocation to provide a unified expert opinion on this topic. It was hypothesized that there would be a high degree of consensus in the diagnosis and the treatment of AC joint dislocations despite the plethora of literature on diagnostic tools and treatment options.

### Surgical intervention following a first traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation is worthy of consideration [^111ZbWUv]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Up to 60% of patients experience recurrence after a first traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation (FTASD), which is often defined as having experienced either dislocation or subluxation. Thus surgical intervention after FTASD is worthy of consideration and is guided by the number of patients who need to receive surgical intervention to prevent 1 redislocation (i.e., number needed to treat), (subjective) health benefit, complication risk, and costs. Operative intervention through arthroscopic stabilization can be successful in reducing recurrence risk in FTASD, as has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials. Nevertheless, there is a large "gray area" for the indication of arthroscopic stabilization, and it is therefore heavily debated which patients should receive operative treatment. Previous trials showed widely varying redislocation rates in both the intervention and control group, meta-analysis shows 2% to 19% after operative and 20% to 75% after nonoperative treatment, and redislocation rates may not correlate with patient-reported outcomes. The literature is quite heterogeneous, and a major confounder is time to follow-up. Furthermore, there is insufficient standardization of reporting of outcomes and no consensus on definition of risk factors. As a result, surgery is a reasonable intervention for FTASD patients, but in which patients it best prevents redislocation requires additional refinement.

### Treatment and rehabilitation of subtalar dislocations: a case series and a review of the literature [^115crgkN]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subtalar dislocation is an uncommon orthopaedic pathology, representing 1% of all traumatic injuries of the foot and 1–2% of all dislocations, mostly affecting young male adults. While its urgent treatment consisting in reduction and immobilization of the dislocation has been well described, disagreement exists about post-operative management with specific regards to immobilization length and rehabilitation protocols.

Materials and Method

A case series of traumatic subtalar dislocations treated with urgent reduction, a mean of 4 weeks immobilization and subsequent rehabilitation is presented, with 1-year minimum clinical and subjective follow up. Also, a systematic review of the literature concerning the post-operative management following a subtalar dislocation, and subsequent results, has been performed.

Results

At 1-year minimum follow up, none of the patients presented with complications such as recurrence of dislocation or talus osteonecrosis. Tibio-talar and subtalar range of motion (ROM) were superimposable to the contralateral joints, with a maximum difference of 5°. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score highlighted a good functionality and a full recovery in all patients but one. Pure subtalar dislocations led to better results than complicated ones. Review of current literature available on the topic demonstrated that an earlier mobilization resulted in better ROM, but the global outcome did not differ among 4 to 6 weeks of immobilization.

Discussion

Conflicting reports are present in the literature regarding the most appropriate post-reduction management of subtalar dislocations. In our case series, successful results have been obtained with a mean of 4 weeks of limb immobilization and an early rehabilitation protocol.

Conclusions

Although some limitations are present, 4 weeks immobilization appears to be the best balance between a good overall outcome and a better recovery of ROM. Further studies are needed to deepen the subject.

### Risk factors which predispose first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations to recurrent instability in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vQCsQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Many studies have reported the rate of recurrent instability following a first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation to be over 75%. Many variables influence recurrent instability such as sex, age, laxity and other pathological lesions. Across all these variables, our study showed the rate of recurrent instability 1 year after a first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation was 39%.

What is the true rate of recurrence after first-time shoulder dislocation?

The rate of 39% is a great deal lower than other studies, which have compared patients treated non-surgically compared with those treated surgically. These clinical studiesexcluded a large proportion of participants due to poor recruitment methods (eg, only including the participants who present for medical treatment and ignoring those who do not contact medical professionals). The strict inclusion and exclusion criteria necessary for rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can result in study populations which are not representative of the general population as only those participants with pathological lesions are entered into the trial, and therefore data may be skewed in favour of surgical stabilisation. Prospective cohort studies are ideal to accurately identify risk factors for recurrent instability. These study designs do not exclude any participant who has had a first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation and consequently provide a more complete picture of the risk factors for this population. Three other seminal papers have reported similar results with regard to rates of recurrent shoulder instability as found in this review. However, one was a prospective intervention study, one included both traumatic and atraumatic dislocations, and one did not have an adequate follow-up period. These studies therefore did not reach the inclusion criteria required to examine this topic and were excluded from the review.

### Acute traumatic posterior shoulder dislocation [^112fxVBb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior shoulder dislocation occurs rarely and is challenging to manage. The mechanisms of trauma are varied, which complicates diagnosis. Missed or delayed diagnosis and treatment can have serious deleterious effects on shoulder function. All cases of suspected posterior shoulder dislocation require a high level of suspicion and appropriate imaging. Identification of associated injuries, such as fractures and rotator cuff tears, is important to guide treatment. In the acute setting, most patients are treated with closed or open reduction with additional soft-tissue or bony procedures. Patients treated in a delayed fashion for persistent instability may require additional procedures, including arthroplasty.

### Comparison of tetradecyl sulfate versus polidocanol injections for stabilisation of joints that regularly dislocate in an Ehlers-Danlos population [^112rdBzS]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Early analysis of treatments with strong strengthening injections of tetradecyl sulfate versus polidocanol indicates that they are likely equal to each other for efficacy. The study suggests that the process of building up collagen with sclerosants may make it harder to tear down a bundle than the effort required to tear down a few strands: even when dealing with abnormal collagen synthesis.

There is potential hope for the EDS community internationally with a non-surgical option for stabilising joints with results visible from quite low numbers of treatments needed per dislocated joint. If there is fresh injury, there is no significant contraindication to going back and treating the same area. There appear to be no additional risks for reinjecting areas that have been previously injected, when a new injury happens.

Study limitations

This is a retrospective, single-centre, single-physician study. Patient reporting is for no more dislocations (and unable to demonstrate dislocatability of joint(s) at will anymore). Follow-up was only from 3 months out to 3 years so far. There is the potential for reporting bias from patients with regard to further dislocation, or lack thereof, but the absence of being able to dislocate the joints at will at follow-up, and the willingness to have other joints treated when more than one was involved counters this risk to a certain degree.

However, there has been a high satisfaction rating from patients (and overloaded waiting list resulting from successful treatments of others). We have noted that subsequent reinjury takes fewer injections to restabilise the joints.

Interpretation

While the treatment of soft tissue injuries with prolotherapy/sclerosant therapy is not new, the use in the EDS population and more particularly in those with recurrent dislocations has not been previously studied. The use of sclerosants in TMJ injuries has been previously noted to be beneficial in the general population, and this study remains consistent with those results.

Generalisability

More studies are needed internationally to confirm the results of this retrospective study. Other agents may also be considered, although our clinic found dextrose to be a much weaker sclerosant in general, and has not been used at our clinic for many years. If others can trial and reproduce these results, then there is a significant potential to reduce suffering in the EDS population. There remains potential that others with recurrent dislocations, but no EDS, may also benefit from this treatment.

### Treatment patterns and clinical and economic burden of hip dislocation following primary total hip arthroplasty in england [^115n2kFh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dislocation after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been estimated to range from 0.2% to 10% within one year of THA. Previous studies evaluating the clinical and economic impact of the treatment of THA dislocation have mainly focused on the occurrence and cost of THA revision and have not comprehensively evaluated the long-term cumulative consequences of THA dislocation. - The decision to revise a THA after dislocation will only be made once several attempts at conservative treatment have been undertaken, and each of these treatment cycles carry cost and quality of life (QoL) consequences. Additionally, once successful treatment is completed, the patient with THA dislocation will require additional rehabilitation and may be at a higher risk of further complications. The burden of THA dislocation has been shown to differ by study design, and by the patient populations and countries of analysis.- To our knowledge, data regarding the real-world prevalence, treatment practice patterns, and clinical and economic burden of hip dislocation in England are not available. Hence, the objectives of the current study were to quantify the incidence of hip dislocation following THA and the two-year practice patterns, healthcare resource use, costs, and QoL outcomes associated with hip dislocation in England.

### Traumatic posterior glenohumeral dislocation: classification, pathoanatomy, diagnosis, and treatment [^112Q3J1E]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Posterior humeral dislocations often go undetected. Proposed explanations for the delay in diagnosis include failure of the evaluating physician to include the condition in the differential diagnosis, suboptimal radiographic evaluation and interpretation, and coincidental injuries such as fractures that can confound the patient's presentation. It is imperative that the orthopedic surgeon develop a complete understanding of the nature of this injury and its treatment so that patients who present with this condition can be diagnosed and treated effectively. This article provides a detailed discussion of the classification, pathoanatomy, diagnosis, and treatment of traumatic posterior glenohumeral dislocation.

### Knee joint dislocations-current epidemiology and treatment in Germany [^1111c5Yg]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical management trends in this study indicate that most patients (33%–77%) initially underwent closed reduction, which is the standard of care for stabilizing dislocations while minimizing further soft tissue damage. However, a significant proportion of these cases required additional stabilization with external fixation, suggesting that knee dislocations are often complex injuries requiring staged management. The frequent performance of open surgeries for ligamentous repair, including medial and lateral capsuloligamentous reconstructions, supports the need for comprehensive surgical planning to address multiple injured structures. This aligns with best practices in treating knee dislocations, which often require multiligament reconstruction to restore function and stability.

The relatively high rate of joint irrigation with arthrolysis (11%–16%) indicates a preference for minimally invasive surgical techniques, which may reduce recovery times and minimize postoperative complications. The requirement for revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) in 2%–9% of cases points to the challenges of managing dislocations in patients with pre‐existing knee prostheses. Clinicians should be aware of the increased complexity of such cases and consider early referral to specialized centres for these patients. The need for neurolysis in 5%–8% of cases highlights the importance of addressing nerve injuries, which are a common and serious complication of knee dislocations. Prompt neurolysis is essential to optimize patient outcomes, as these nerve injuries can have long‐term functional consequences.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^115QoHFm]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

What is the optimal treatment for peroneal tendon ruptures?

6.1 Complete rupture of one tendon can be treated conservatively in the inactive and asymptomatic patient.
6.2 In active patients, symptomatic complete rupture of one of the two peroneal tendons should usually be treated with repair. If repair is not possible, a single-stage hamstring autograft or tenodesis may be performed. In tenodesis, there is no preference of PB to PL or PL to PB. When these options are not feasible, FHL or FDL tendon transfer is a final option. In Fig. 3, a schematic algorithm for the treatment of peroneal tendon ruptures is presented.

Rationale

Complete rupture of one of the tendons can be treated conservatively in the event that the patient remains low demand and asymptomatic. In the symptomatic or highly active patient, however, surgical management is often required to support return to sports. Patients with rupture of both tendons benefit from surgical management to treat their symptoms. The panel agrees that, if possible, the tendon tissue should be preserved and, therefore, recommends end-to-end repair of the rupture(s).

In cases when this is not possible, the panel recommended the same treatment algorithm agreed for peroneal tendon tears. If grafting or tenodesis remains insufficient, a tendon transfer may be considered. It should be recognised that elite athletes may not return to their pre-operative level of sports after surgical treatment for peroneal tendon rupture.

What is the optimal treatment for acute peroneal tendon dislocation?

7.1 Treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation should be based on whether it is an acute or chronic injury and whether or not the patient is an athlete.
7.2 The non-athlete with an acute dislocation may be offered conservative management but should be warned that there is a 50% chance of recurrent dislocation. In case of unsuccessful conservative management or chronic instability, surgical intervention is advised.
7.3 Surgery is recommended for elite athletes having sustained either acute or chronic dislocation.
7.4 Surgery in non-athletes with acute peroneal instability consists of reduction of the tendons into the retrofibular groove and repair of the SPR. There was no agreement as to whether to perform an additional groove deepening in non-athletes.
7.5 There was agreement that surgical treatment in athletes should routinely include groove deepening, regardless of other possible treatment gestures. Figure 4 shows a schematic algorithm on treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114wMmzh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Two reviewers (LK and TL) independently assessed the study-level risk of bias according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Back Review Group. The risk of bias assessment has 12 independent criteria; with a judgement of 'yes', 'unclear' or 'no'. If at least six of the 12 criteria were judged to be at low risk of bias ('yes'), the risk of bias in the publication was considered low.

To assess possible selective reporting of results, we compared the outcome measures specified in the methods section of the publication and in the trial registry (if available) to what was reported in the results section of the publication. For the analysis of the timing of the outcome assessment, we deemed a deviation of 3 months (in a 2-year follow-up) to be an acceptable range. Disagreements between the two reviewers on the retrieved data were resolved by consensus. If any item was unclear, we contacted the authors by email to clarify the issue.

Researcher conflict of interest and industry sponsorship have been identified as potential sources of bias. We evaluated and noted the existence of these potential sources of bias in the studies.

### Operative versus nonoperative treatment after primary traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation: expected-value decision analysis [^117J1pSb]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management strategy for primary traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation remains controversial. Patients have traditionally been managed nonoperatively, but high recurrence rates in certain populations have led to increased interest in early operative stabilization. The purpose of this study was to use expected-value decision analysis to determine the optimal management strategy — nonoperative treatment or arthroscopic stabilization — for a first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation.

Materials and Methods

Probabilities for the occurrences of the potential outcomes after nonoperative and arthroscopic treatment of a first-time traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation were determined from a systematic review of the literature. Utilities for these outcomes were obtained from a questionnaire on patient preferences completed by 42 subjects without a history of shoulder injury. A decision tree was constructed, fold-back analysis was performed to determine optimal management, and sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effect on decision making of varying outcome probabilities and utilities.

Results

Nonoperative treatment was associated with a utility value of 5.9 and early arthroscopic surgery with a value of 7.6. On sensitivity analysis, it was found that when the rate of recurrence after nonoperative treatment falls below 32% or when the utility value for successful arthroscopic stabilization falls below 6.6, nonoperative treatment is the preferred management strategy.

Conclusions

Arthroscopic stabilization was the preferred strategy after a primary anterior glenohumeral dislocation. In clinical settings where the likelihood of recurrent instability is low after nonoperative care or when an informed patient has an aversion to surgery, nonoperative treatment may be the preferred treatment strategy.

### Surgical treatment of chronic elbow dislocation allowing for early range of motion: operative technique and clinical results [^114ZY9oU]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although chronic elbow dislocations are rare in the developed world, they are a common problem in developing countries. A chronically dislocated elbow joint typically results in a contracted triceps muscle, fibrosis of the joint capsule, collateral ligament contracture, possible ulnar nerve involvement, and fibrosis of the articular surface and olecranon fossa. Any intervention must address these soft tissue abnormalities. Goals of surgical treatment of chronic simple elbow dislocations include improving patient outcome through obtaining a concentric reduction and restoring functional elbow joint ROM while preserving elbow stability. As surgical technique has evolved, surgeons have become more aggressive in treating chronic elbow dislocations operatively.

Injury chronicity and patient age were previously controversial factors when considering surgical intervention for chronic elbow dislocations. There are several older studies that report poor outcomes in patients with an elbow dislocation for greater than 3 months and suggest treating these patients either nonoperatively or surgically with elbow arthroplasty. In addition to the current study, more recent studies have demonstrated good functional outcomes in patients with elbow dislocation greater than 3 months duration. Mahaisavariya et al reported mixed results in 2 patients with an elbow dislocation for 60 weeks where the patients' final arc of motion was 30 and 100 degrees. Naidoo reported functional elbow ROM (greater than or equal to 100 degrees) in 39% of patients (9/23) who underwent open reduction greater than 3 months (range, 4 months–4.5 years) after initial injury. In our series, 78% (25/32 patients) had an elbow dislocation for 3 months or greater, and we were able to restore 53% (17/32) of patients to functional ROM. Previous reports suggest that open reduction of chronic elbow dislocation in adults results in poor outcomes and that open reduction should be reserved for pediatric patients. However, our case series would agree with more recent studies that demonstrate significant functional improvement in adult patients. Based on our case series, open reduction should remain a treatment option for patients regardless of age and chronicity of injury.

### Management of failed instability surgery: how to get it right the next time [^111KZ1uD]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations are the most frequent type of joint dislocation and affect approximately 1.7% of the general population. The literature supports the consideration of primary stabilization in high-risk patients because of reported recurrences as high as 80% to 90% with nonoperative treatment regimens. Successful stabilization of anterior glenohumeral instability relies on not only good surgical techniques but also careful patient selection. Failure rates after open and arthroscopic stabilization have been reported to range from 2% to 8% and 4% to 13%, respectively. Recurrent shoulder instability leads to increased morbidity to the patient, increased pain, decreased activity level, prolonged time away from work and sports, and a general decrease in quality of life. This article reviews the potential pitfalls in anterior shoulder stabilization and discusses appropriate methods of addressing them in revision surgery.

Risk of bias assessment

All trials were of parallel-group, prospective design. Twenty-one were classical RCTs; one used a minimisation algorithm. Two trials were double blind, seven were single blindand 13 were not blinded. Loss to follow-up ranged from 0% to 20%. Intention-to-treat analysis was reported in all publications. The sample sizes ranged from 30 to 198 participants. Sample size estimation was described by 14 trials; one of these met the prespecified assumptions of the sample size estimation. Levels of evidence of the included trials are presented in online supplementary appendix table 6.

Risk of bias was high in two RCTs. There was a high risk of detection bias due to variation in the timing of the follow-up assessments; three(14%) of the 22 trials met the minimum criterion of less than 3-month discrepancy between scheduled and actual follow-up visit (online supplementary appendix table 7).

Two trials disclosed a potential conflict of interest and industry sponsorship, three disclosed industry sponsorshipand five disclosed either conflict of interest or industry sponsorship. Six trials made an explicit statement of no conflicts of interest or industry sponsorship, and nine did not mention conflict of interest or industry sponsorship (online supplementary appendix table 7).

GRADE analysis and summary of findings

The quality of evidence varied from very low to moderate. The most common reasons for downgrading were absence of blinding and imprecision. Summary of findings tables are presented below within the subsections of synthesis of results.

### Spontaneous temporomandibular joint dislocation [^1125oFMC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the displacement of the head of the condyle from its normal position in the glenoid fossa. Anterior dislocations are the most common type of TMJ dislocations. Prognathism of the lower jaw, anterior crossbite, and open bite are the classic features in bilateral TMJ dislocations. The treatment of acute TMJ dislocation involves manual reduction with or without general anesthesia. The use of maxillomandibular fixation is reserved for chronic, more complex dislocations. Determining the presence of a predisposing factor is very important in guiding the correct treatment and management for this condition. The authors present a case of acute spontaneous temporomandibular joint dislocation where multiple predisposing factors were recognized, requiring treatment with maxillomandibular fixation after manual reduction.

### Racial / ethnic differences in emergency care for joint dislocation in 53 US EDs [^113Nm8ep]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate racial/ethnic differences in emergency care for patients with joint dislocation.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of the dislocation component of the National Emergency Department Safety Study. Using a principal diagnosis of dislocation, we identified emergency department (ED) visits for joint dislocations in 53 urban EDs across 19 US states between 2003 and 2005. Quality of care was evaluated based on 9 guideline-concordant care measures.

Results

Of the 1945 patients included in this analysis, 1124 (58%) were white; 561 (29%), black, and 260 (13%), Hispanic. One-third of the 53 EDs cared for 51% of minority patients. After multivariable adjustment, black patients were less likely to receive any analgesic treatment (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.90) or opioid treatment (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41–0.997), waited longer to receive analgesia (mean difference in time to analgesic treatment, 32 minutes; 95% CI, 16–52 minutes), and were less likely to receive reassessments of pain (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34–0.70) compared with white patients. There were no ethnic disparities in most of the care measures between Hispanic and white patients. There were no disparities in initial pain assessment, pre- and postprocedural neurovascular assessment, procedural monitoring, or success of joint reduction across the racial/ethnic groups.

Conclusions

Black patients presenting to the ED with joint dislocations received lower quality of care in some, but not all, areas compared with white patients. Future interventions should target these areas to eliminate racial disparities in dislocation care.

### Fingertip injuries [^1173jf7j]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — management requires closed reduction and specific immobilization positioning: "Dislocation of the DIP joint requires reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar [palmar] dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for 2 to 3 weeks". The presence of an open wound "necessitates surgical management with appropriate washout to prevent infection". After reduction, "periodic reevaluation is essential to assess joint stability and manage potential complications such as recurrent dislocation or joint stiffness", and "physical therapy and hand rehabilitation exercises should be initiated early to restore range of motion and strength".

### Pavlik harness disease revisited: does prolonged treatment of a dislocated hip in a harness adversely affect the α angle? [^115Lyn5A]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, the median length of time in harness between ultrasounds was only 4 weeks, although 40% were treated for > 5 weeks. As a result, our data may not be generalizable to longer-term Pavlik use. Given the extreme dogma of Pavlik harness disease, however, it is nearly impossible either retrospectively or prospectively to identify a cohort of infants with persistent dislocations treated in a harness for longer periods than this study. Although the number of hips in this series was somewhat modest, a larger series would be challenging to isolate given the high success rate of Pavlik harness treatment. By pooling patients from a large, tertiary-care children's hospital and a multicenter, international study group, we feel that the study cohort was as robust as feasibly allowed, and also more broadly representative of the general population. As a retrospective sample, our study was subject to inherent selection bias, as a predetermined criterion for Pavlik harness failure was not utilized. In addition, it is possible that the hips in this study were developing "better" than other hips failing harness treatment, which is why the treating surgeon felt comfortable continuing use of the Pavlik beyond the typical guidelines. To minimize this possibility, we used a consistent definition of a dislocation based on objective ultrasonographic criteria to ensure that hips were "similarly" dislocated both at Pavlik initiation and termination, thereby implying that no significant improvement occurred over the treatment period. Finally, a decision was made a priori only to follow patients until the point at which stable reduction was achieved, as this study's primary objective was to investigate changes to the acetabulum during failed harness use and their potential effect on the ultimate means of reduction. We therefore cannot comment on the incidence of osteonecrosis or residual dysplasia following failed Pavlik treatment. Despite these limitations, we believe this study is an important first step toward objectively questioning a widely believed concept that has little supportive evidence.

In conclusion, based on the lengths of harness treatment in our series, most hips did not exhibit negative changes in the acetabular AA in response to prolonged treatment of a dislocated hip in Pavlik harness. Furthermore, the success of subsequent treatment was not compromised by extended use of the harness. With appropriate monitoring, therefore, prolonged management of a dislocated hip with Pavlik harness may have fewer adverse consequences than previously thought. Further investigation is required to definitively confirm or refute the presence of Pavlik harness disease.

### Comparison of the outcome of early and delayed surgical treatment of complete acromioclavicular joint dislocation [^1111XSS6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic results and the complication rate between early and delayed surgical treatment of acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation.

Methods

Publications in the management of ACJ dislocation are identified from the PubMed database between January 1993 and December 2013 using "acromioclavicular joint" and "dislocation" as keywords. The eligibility criteria included are as follows: (1) ACJ dislocation; (2) intervention, early compared with delayed surgical treatment or the surgical treatment for acute compared with chronic ACJ dislocation; (3) human; and (4) English articles. Exclusion criteria consist of the following: (1) type I and type II ACJ dislocation, (2) no definition of the time of early and delayed surgery in studies, (3) no comparison between the clinical result of early and delayed surgery in studies, (4) laboratory studies, radiographic studies, biomechanical studies, (5) the cases including fractures or revisions in studies, and (6) systematic analyses.

Results

Eight studies comparing early and delayed surgical treatment of ACJ dislocation are included in this systematic review. According to Constant scores and shoulder subjective value, early surgery has better functional outcomes than delayed surgery in the treatment of ACJ dislocation (P < 0.05). Partial-dislocation/re-dislocation is found at 26.0% in early and 38.1% in delayed surgical treatment (P < 0.05). The rate of CC ossification in early surgical treatment is found as the same as the delayed. The complication rates are found at 12.5% in early surgical treatment and 17.7% in the delayed, which is not significantly different.

Conclusion

Early surgical treatment may have superiority to the delayed procedure in the management of ACJ dislocation with better functional outcomes and more satisfied reduction. However, high-quality evidence studies are required to provide stronger support for this opinion in the future.

### Editorial commentary: patellofemoral stabilization for first-time dislocation in skeletally immature patients achieves excellent outcomes, yet indications remain unclear [^112M6zh4]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, initial management of patellofemoral instability without osteochondral fracture consists of bracing and physical therapy, but up to 50% of skeletally immature patients may develop recurrent instability. Recent studies suggest that patients with first-time dislocations may benefit from surgical stabilization. Risk stratification is essential; those with ligamentous laxity, increased patellar height, and trochlear dysplasia have greater failure rates with nonoperative management. Surgery in skeletally immature patients also entails risk. We recommend conservative management to most patients with a first-time patellar dislocation. Patients with high-risk features are counseled candidly about their elevated risk of failure potentially requiring surgery.

### Pitch-side management of acute shoulder dislocations: a conceptual review [^111Z647m]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Shoulder dislocations are relatively common sporting injuries and even in the absence of clinically validated guidelines, pitch-side reduction of an 'uncomplicated' anterior dislocation is common practice. A good history and through clinical examination would help discern the potentially limb-threatening injuries that require urgent referral to hospital or those that may require radiographic confirmation of fracture exclusion. However, there is no substitute for sound clinical judgement. When a decision is made to reduce an anteriorly dislocated shoulder, do so at the earliest opportunity to avoid overcoming increasing resistance due to muscle spasm using techniques that you are familiar with. Once reduced, the shoulder should be immobilised in the most comfortable position and referred for an expert opinion. However, we recommend those 'pitch-side' medical practitioners who provide this form of support should have attended appropriate training and ensure adequate malpractice cover.

Finally, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst; a patient will always thank you for a successful reduction!

Learning points

Anterior dislocations account for up to 90% of all shoulder dislocations.
Athletes with a high index of suspicion for a fracture should be referred to the nearest hospital without any attempts at reduction
Prior to attempting reduction, confirm that the shoulder is anteriorly dislocated: Loss of normal shoulder contour? Arm held in abducted and externally rotated position? Anteriorly palpable humeral head?
Always assess the neurovascular status of the limb, prior to and after reduction.

What are the new findings?

In the absence of a standardised management protocol published for the initial management of an anterior dislocated shoulder in a pitch-side setting, this article proposes a structured, systematic approach to the pitch-side management of a shoulder dislocation.
Despite the availability of different reduction techniques, few are applicable in a pitch-side setting. The Stimson and Spaso techniques are simple and effective for pitch-side reduction with the external rotation method being an effective alternative.
With regard to postreduction care, immobilise the limb in the most comfortable position prior to referral to hospital.

### Prolonged immobilization in abduction and neutral rotation for a first-episode anterior shoulder dislocation [^112WDGCW]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

Patients who sustain first-episode anterior glenohumeral dislocations are at risk to develop chronic glenohumeral instability. Current treatment options after an initial anterior glenohumeral dislocation include immediate surgery, delayed surgery, or conservative interventions such as immobilization and strengthening exercises. Duration of immobilization is variable among formal studies. Recent research suggests that typical immobilization positions may not allow adequate healing and in fact may promote glenohumeral joint instability.

Case Description

The patient was a 19-year-old male who sustained a first-episode anterior glenohumeral dislocation during athletic activity. Physical therapy management included a longer-than-typical period of immobilization and protected activity to allow for more complete healing. The shoulder abduction and neutral rotation immobilization position used with this patient may increase healing of structures that influence stability of the shoulder

Outcomes

At 13 weeks after the dislocation, the patient had full active and passive range of motion, near normal strength, and no complaints of pain or instability. At a 20-month follow-up the patient had resumed full activities of daily living including recreational sports without symptoms of instability.

Discussion

Conservative intervention options for first-episode anterior shoulder dislocations need further study. Immobilization and protected activity periods should be adequate to allow for complete healing. The optimal positions for immobilization should be determined and implemented.

### Shoulder reduction bench project: improving care for patients with shoulder dislocations [^113yYmUn]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder dislocation is the most common large joint dislocation seen in the emergency department with an incidence in the UK of 40.4 per 100 000 person-years in men and 15.5 per 100 000 person-years in women. It is an extremely painful and debilitating injury.

The ability to treat a shoulder dislocation is vital for emergency medicine practitioners, and a department should strive to treat them as efficiently as possible.

Problem description

In September 2016, a departmental audit had highlighted poor compliance with the Royal College of Emergency Medicine guidelines on the time taken to reduce shoulder dislocations. A sample of 30 patients with a coded diagnosis of shoulder dislocation from September 2015 to September 2016 was analysed. The inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed shoulder dislocations on X-ray, who were successfully treated and discharged from the emergency department. Since the paediatric department is managed as a separate unit, we excluded patients under 16 years old.

The key outcomes were measured, and the results were as follows:

2 hours 25 min average from triage to confirmed shoulder reduction X-ray (range: 1 hour 14 min to 5 hours 3 min),
3 hours 22 min average triage to discharge (range: 1 hour 46 min to 6 hours 39 min),
57% (17/30) patients sedated for shoulder reduction.

These results were striking as shoulder dislocations can and should be managed promptly. We also found a sedation rate of 57% concerning. Previous literature has quoted a 4% risk of an adverse event following procedural sedation in the emergency department. National guidance mandates a minimum of two physicians (one performing the procedure, one administering sedation) and one nurse to safely sedate a patient.

Reducing shoulder dislocations can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient, and associated muscle spasm can be difficult for the physician to overcome. To facilitate the reduction, an array of different medication strategies can be used. For our project, we defined analgesia as the use of opioid analgesia (ie, Morphine) with or without an analgesic with anxiolytic properties (ie, nitrous oxide). Sedation is defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness, typically provided in our department with a benzodiazepine (Midazolam) and/or a general anaesthetic agent (Propofol).

Quality of patient care can be defined as a service that is safe, caring, responsive, efficient and well-led. When applying this definition to the identified problem, the initial questions were addressed as given in table 1.

### Outcomes of arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent instability are equal to stabilization after a primary event [^116vAe6A]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Extensive literature exists relating to the management of shoulder instability, with a more recent focus on glenoid and humeral bone loss. However, the optimal timing for surgery following a dislocation remains unclear. There is concern that recurrent dislocations may worsen subsequent surgical outcomes, with some advocating stabilization after the first dislocation. The aim of this study was to determine if the recurrence of instability following arthroscopic stabilization in patients without significant glenoid bone loss was influenced by the number of dislocations prior to surgery.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, Orthosearch, and Cochrane databases with the following search terms: ((shoulder or glenohumeral) and (dislocation or subluxation) and arthroscopic and (Bankart or stabilisation or stabilization) and (redislocation or re-dislocation or recurrence or instability)). Methodology followed the PRISMA guidelines. Data and outcomes were synthesized by two independent reviewers, and papers were assessed for bias and quality.

Results

Overall, 35 studies including 7,995 shoulders were eligible for analysis, with a mean follow-up of 32.7 months (12 to 159.5). The rate of post-stabilization instability was 9.8% in first-time dislocators, 9.1% in recurrent dislocators, and 8.5% in a mixed cohort. A descriptive analysis investigated the influence of recurrent instability or age in the risk of instability post-stabilization, with an association seen with increasing age and a reduced risk of recurrence post-stabilization.

Conclusion

Using modern arthroscopic techniques, patients sustaining an anterior shoulder dislocation without glenoid bone loss can expect a low risk of recurrence postoperatively, and no significant difference was found between first-time and recurrent dislocators. Furthermore, high-risk cohorts can expect a low, albeit slightly higher, rate of redislocation. With the findings of this study, patients and clinicians can be more informed as to the likely outcomes of arthroscopic stabilization within this patient subset.

### Pitch-side management of acute shoulder dislocations: a conceptual review [^112zJWBx]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The shoulder, specifically the glenohumeral joint, by virtue of its anatomical characteristics and biomechanics confers a large range of movement, which ultimately results in a joint that is inherently prone to becoming unstable. The incidence of acute traumatic shoulder dislocation varies within the sporting environment, commonly occurring following direct trauma. Anterior dislocations account for nearly 90% of all dislocations. While most are referred and managed in the emergency department, pitch-side relocation by experienced clinicians does occur prior to referral. The aim of this study was to delineate a guideline specifically for the pitch-side management of this common injury. A literature search of PubMed and Medline using the keywords 'prehospital ', ' pitch-side', ' shoulder dislocation ' and 'reduction ' or 'relocation technique ' was performed, and the available literature was reviewed and collated. Articles focusing on reduction techniques were then reviewed, with particular consideration on their applicability to a pitch-side setting. While studies exist that compare and contrast examination and reduction techniques, most are based in a hospital setting. To date, there is no standardised management protocol published for the initial management of an anterior dislocated shoulder in a pitch-side setting. This article addresses this discrepancy and proposes a structured, algorithmic approach to the pitch-side management of a shoulder dislocation. The article addresses factors to consider in a pitch-side setting, suitable techniques and postreduction care. While a systematic approach has been delineated in this article, we recommend those pitch-side medical practitioners who provide this form of support should have attended appropriate training and ensure adequate malpractice cover.

### Immobilisation following traumatic anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation: a literature review [^114pK4im]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Traumatic anterior dislocations of the shoulder are common and disabling injuries, in young and old alike. For centuries, the means of managing this injury has been to immobilise the affected shoulder after reduction, for up to 8 weeks, in an adducted and internally rotated position. The aim of this literature review is to assess whether traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations should be immobilised; for how long should they be immobilised; and whether the position of immobilisation affects outcomes. An electronic literature search was performed of the databases AMED, Cinahl, Embase, Medline (using Ovid), PEDro and Pubmed, from their inceptions to February 2005. Human clinical trials, written in English, which could assist in answering the research questions, were included. Sixteen (of 168) papers met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The review suggests that it remains unclear whether patients with traumatic primary anterior shoulder dislocations should be immobilised, or for how long. Similarly, it remains uncertain whether patients should be immobilised in internal, or external rotation. Much of this uncertainty is due to the limited size of the evidence base, which exhibited numerous methodological weaknesses (e.g. small sample sizes, no control groups, not evaluating findings against statistical tests). Recommendations are made to develop the evidence base.

### External rotation immobilization for primary shoulder dislocation: a randomized controlled trial [^111d6znf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional treatment for primary anterior shoulder dislocations has been immobilization in a sling with the arm in a position of adduction and internal rotation. However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods

Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1–7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12–43 months). Recurrent instability was defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]) were also collected. Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).

Results

With the numbers available, there was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74) and, although the difference in ASES scores approached statistical significance (p = 0.05), the magnitude of this difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.

Conclusions

Despite previous published findings, our results show immobilization in external rotation did not confer a significant benefit versus sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Further studies with larger numbers may elucidate whether functional outcomes, compliance, or comfort with immobilization can be improved with this device.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^114UEANe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability

There were no RCTs exploring the effectiveness of surgery versus non-surgical treatment, which is an important evidence gap. Open labrum repair appears to be more effective than arthroscopic labrum repair in successfully stabilising an unstable shoulder, while there was no difference in other outcomes or harms. The point estimate for the RR was 0.43; this means that arthroscopic technique was more than twice as likely to fail as open technique, and the NNH was approximately 12, defined here as a shoulder redislocation that would not have occurred if open technique had been used instead of arthroscopy. Previous meta-analyses, which have also included non-randomised studies, have suggested no difference between open and arthroscopic techniquesor a difference in favour of the open method. Although we have witnessed a rapid increase in the popularity of arthroscopy within the past two decades to the point of it being considered the accepted standard, our findings might justify a tempering of enthusiasm for the arthroscopic method. On the other hand, even though the perceived effectiveness of surgery might be overestimated since the natural course of chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability is largely unknown, the results of surgery for chronic instability are encouraging in terms of the low redislocation rates after surgery in the included trials.

Study bias

The risk of bias among the included RCTs was relatively low. However, concern for confounding still exists, as there was considerable heterogeneity in the follow-up time and less than half (41%) of the studies used any kind of blinding. In most trials, the primary outcome was recurrent dislocation, a relatively 'hard' endpoint. However, in the included RCTs, the definition of redislocation varied from a solely symptoms-based diagnosis to one that was confirmed radiographically or alternatively, an event that required a manual reduction. Analysis on the effect of conflicts of interest or industry sponsorship on trial results was not possible due to heterogeneity.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing a patella-stabilizing, motion-restricting knee brace versus a neoprene nonhinged knee brace after a first-time traumatic patellar dislocation [^11687587]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment for first–time traumatic patellar dislocations is controversial. There is some evidence that surgical management results in a lower risk of recurrent patellar dislocation. Patients treated nonoperatively after a first–time traumatic patellar dislocation have a 20% to 60% risk of redislocation. However, no long–term results have been reported that clearly show an improvement in functional outcomes after surgical management. Because evidence of the benefits of operative treatment is lacking, nonoperative treatment is still the preferred management option after a first–time traumatic patellar dislocation. There is, however, no consensus on the most preferable method of nonoperative treatment after first–time traumatic patellar dislocations. Indeed, nonoperative treatment described in the literature varies from unrestricted knee bracing and exercise to full immobilization of the knee with a long lower limb cast for the first few weeks.

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a patella–stabilizing, motion-restricting knee brace versus a neoprene nonhinged knee brace for the treatment of first–time traumatic patellar dislocation. We hypothesized that the use of a patella–stabilizing, motion-restricting knee brace would not significantly decrease the rate of redislocation at 3 years of follow–up. Second, we hypothesized there would be decreased range of motion (ROM) of the knee, fewer patient–reported symptoms, and worse functional outcomes at 3 years of follow–up after the use of a patella–stabilizing, motion-restricting knee brace as the primary treatment option after a traumatic patellar dislocation.

### Simultaneous open and closed dislocations of adjacent metacarpophalangeal joints: a case report [^112gSpRm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) dislocations are uncommon, and when open are often complex, requiring surgical intervention for reduction. A 38-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with simultaneous open and closed dorsal dislocations of adjacent MCP joints of the index and long fingers that were successfully treated by closed reduction in the ED. Injuries to the MCP joint can severely affect hand function when treatment is delayed and, thus, it is an accepted principle that definitive treatment should be achieved as quickly as possible for optimal functional outcome. In the case of dorsal dislocations of the MCP joints, aggressive ED intervention followed by brief immobilization and early hand therapy referral may result in dramatic clinical improvement for the patient without the need for surgery.

### Total joint replacement after condylar destruction secondary to long-standing dislocation of the temporomandibular joint [^1154JW1T]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To describe the treatment of 2 long-standing chronic dislocation of the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) and 1 chronic recurrent dislocation.

Methods

This report describes the treatment of 3 patients; 2 with a long-standing chronic dislocation of the TMJ and 1 with a chronic recurrent dislocation. Duration of dislocation and anatomical considerations make the treatment challenging and controversial. The patients presented in this report all developed destruction of their condyles. They were successfully treated with total joint replacement with alloplastic devices.

Results

All the 3 patients underwent successful surgery and recovery. Mandibular function and pain level were significantly improved.

Conclusion

Long-standing dislocation of the TMJ is rare. This condition can be successfully treated by resection of the damaged condyles and reconstruction with alloplastic total TMJ replacements.

### Teaching patients how to reduce a shoulder dislocation: a randomized clinical trial comparing the boss-holzach-matter self-assisted technique and the spaso method [^115eTgQ5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Shoulder dislocation is the most common joint dislocation of the body, accounting for > 60% of all dislocations treated in the emergency department. Epidemiological studies published in the U.S. have cited an incidence of 11.2 to 23.9 per 100,000 person-years. Multiple techniques for reducing these dislocations have been described in the literature -, mostly in case reports and retrospective studies with very few articles comparing techniques in a randomized manner -.

Most maneuvers require trained personnel to guide and perform the technique, and their success rate has been fairly high. However, many shoulder dislocations occur in remote areas where the individual is participating in sports or outdoor activities and medical personnel might not be available for initial care and treatment. This is important since it has been observed that a delay before the first attempt at reduction of a shoulder dislocation is associated with a lower chance of that reduction being successful. Moreover, many reduction protocols are resource-intensive in that they require sedation and multiple personnel for reduction and monitoring. Thus, there is a need for a simple and effective reduction technique that can be used as a first-line treatment in the emergency department for anterior shoulder dislocations in order to reduce health-care cost and the time until reduction.

Although an abundance of techniques for the reduction of anterior shoulder dislocations have been described, there are not many descriptions of self-assisted maneuvers -, where the patient guides and performs the reduction.

Given the high rate of recurrence of this type of injury, especially in the young population (overall recurrence rate, 90% in patients < 21 years of age and 70% in the 21 to 30-year age group), we believe that teaching a self-assisted reduction technique to patients at risk for recurrence may be appropriate. This technique should be simple to explain and easy to perform and have a high success rate and a low complication rate. Furthermore, it is speculated that, because self-assisted techniques allow patients to control the process of reduction, they cause less pain.

Our goal in this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a self-assisted reduction maneuver in comparison with one performed by a physician at the emergency department of a tertiary level center. The hypothesis was that the self-assisted maneuver would be less painful and equally effective.

### Who will redislocate his / her shoulder? Predicting recurrent instability following a first traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation [^113U6GFY]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Current non-surgical management appeared to be effective for over 60% of those who report with an FTASD at 12-month follow-up. Addressing factors such as patient education, psychosocial factors such as fear of injury and developing criteria for return to sport/work after a dislocation could further improve non-surgical management.

Limitations

We note several limitations. The outcome of recurrent instability was self-reported and was not validated with a follow-up radiograph. The requirement for radiograph to confirm a dislocation would have excluded subluxation events from the outcome of recurrent instability. However, categorising recurrent instability based on participants' self-report may have influenced the results, particularly in the context of the ability of self-reported questionnaires to predict self-reported instability.

### Arthroscopic bankart repair versus immobilization for first episode of anterior shoulder dislocation before the age of 25: a randomized controlled trial [^1125Qa5h]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of recurrence after the first episode of anterior shoulder dislocation is high with nonoperative treatment in younger patients.

Purpose/Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to compare the results of arthroscopic Bankart repair and nonoperative treatment for shoulder dislocation in patients younger than 25 years, with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. The hypothesis was that surgery would decrease the risk of recurrence.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

We included patients aged between 18 and 25 years after a first episode of anterior shoulder dislocation and divided them into 2 groups. The first group was treated surgically with an arthroscopic Bankart repair within 2 weeks after the dislocation; the second group was treated nonoperatively. Both groups were immobilized for 3 weeks in internal rotation and followed the same physical therapy protocol. Standard radiography and computed tomography were performed immediately after reduction of the dislocation, and follow-up was performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary outcome measure was instability recurrence, defined as another anterior shoulder dislocation requiring closed reduction by another person (the patient was unable to reduce the dislocated joint themselves), a subluxation, or a positive apprehension test. Secondary outcome measures included range of motion, return to sport, and functional scores such as the short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score the Walch-Duplay score, and the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI).

Results

A total of 20 patients were included in each group. The mean ± SD age was 21 ± 1.8 years, and there were 33 men (82.5%) and 7 women (17.5%) in the total sample. Recurrence of instability was significantly decreased in the surgical treatment group compared with the nonoperative group (2 [10%] vs 14 [70%], respectively; p = 0.0001). Fewer patients in the surgical treatment group versus the nonoperative group had another episode of dislocation (0 vs 6 [30%], respectively), subluxation (2 [10%] vs 13 [65%], respectively; p = 0.003), or a positive apprehension test (1 [5%] vs 11 [58%], respectively; p = 0.0005). The Walch-Duplay score (88.4 vs 70.3 points; p = 0.046) and WOSI (11.5 vs 17.7 points; p = 0.035) were significantly better in the surgical group versus the nonoperative group after a 2-year follow-up. Level of sport was the same or better in 89% of the surgical treatment group vs 53% of the nonoperative treatment group (P = 0.012). No surgical complication was recorded. We did not find any significant difference in range of motion.

Conclusion

In patients with first-time shoulder dislocations, arthroscopic labral repair (Bankart procedure) reduced the risk of secondary shoulder dislocation and improved functional outcome versus nonoperative treatment after a 2-year follow-up. Surgical treatment after a first episode of shoulder dislocation could be offered as a primary treatment option in a younger population if these results are confirmed by larger studies with a longer follow-up.

### Acromioclavicular joint dislocation: surgical vs. conservative… [^1139TZv9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is surgical intervention for acromioclavicular joint dislocation superior to conservative interventions in adults. Evidence-Based Answer Surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation of the shoulder does not appear to be superior to conservative management in adults. Both strategies resulted in similar quality of life, function, and return to previous activities after one year. Surgical therapy increases the risk of hardware complications, infection, and continued discomfort.

1. Types I and II are generally considered nonsurgical, and grades IV through VI are surgical. Treatment of type III injuries is controversial and is outside the scope of this review. The authors of this Cochrane review sought to determine if surgical management of AC joint dislocation was superior to conservative management.

The review included six randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials and 357 participants. However, there were no significant differences in shoulder function by one year in studies that included any validated shoulder function assessment tool. No significant differences occurred between treatment groups in level of pain or episodes of treatment failure, although these outcomes had only very low-quality evidence. Return to previous activities tended to occur earlier or was more successful in those who were managed conservatively, although this secondary outcome was assessed with very low-quality evidence and was measured in a variety of ways that could not be consolidated for meta-analysis. Most adverse effects were reported in the surgical group and included infection, problems with hardware, and restricted range of motion.

It should be noted that this Cochrane review encompassed at least 35 conservative treatments and 150 distinct surgical methods for treating AC joint dislocation; further study on specific techniques is warranted because newer methods may have more success. Surgical management may also be warranted for cases in which the shoulder injury is more extensive, such as a co-occurring coracoclavicular ligament strain. However, at least one other systematic review of 14 studies that included 646 patients found no significant difference in outcomes for patients with more severe AC joint dislocations, further suggesting that conservative therapy may be warranted initially for most patients. 3 The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD007429.

### Part II. fractures, dislocations, and thumb injuries… [^117UE8vV]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

2 Management of dislocations begins with reduction and then focuses on treating soft tissue damage. 3 Fractures should be reduced if no rotation is present and then immobilized using splints or casts. Treatment of ligament injuries of the thumb depends on the presence or absence of fracture fragments and on the degree of joint stability. Anesthesia may be necessary to facilitate reduction. Reduction of a dorsal PIP joint dislocation may be achieved by gently applying distal traction to the injured finger while applying volarly directed pressure to the middle phalanx. Reduction is obvious when it occurs. If traction and volarly directed pressure is ineffective, the physician should hyperextend the distal portion to "unlock" the joint and continue applying traction and volarly directed pressure. If reduction is performed immediately, anesthesia is not needed. However, a digital block is usually needed for pain if presentation is delayed for more than one hour.

6 For a digital block, 1 to 2% lidocaine without epinephrine is placed along both sides of the affected digit just distal to the MCP joint. A small-gauge needle should be used. 6 If radiography shows a large fracture fragment, or if reduction is unsuccessful, referral to an orthopedic or hand surgeon is necessary. Reduction of a lateral PIP joint dislocation is accomplished by applying reducing pressure to the deviated distal portion while stabilizing the proximal portion. Treatment should focus on soft tissue damage and include follow-up radiography. DIP JOINT Dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint usually is caused by a crushing injury, and associated trauma may complicate treatment. 8 Uncomplicated DIP joint dislocations are reduced and treated the same as PIP joint dislocations.

After one week, a stable joint should be splinted in flexion for two to four weeks followed by buddy taping and follow-up radiography. 9 To achieve reduction of a metacarpal bone fracture, flex the MCP joint to 90 degrees, applying dorsally directed pressure to the volarly displaced metacarpal head and volarly directed pressure to the proximal fracture fragment. Alternatively, the proximal phalanx or PIP joint can be used as a lever arm to move the metacarpal head upward while counterpressure is applied to the proximal fracture fragment.
