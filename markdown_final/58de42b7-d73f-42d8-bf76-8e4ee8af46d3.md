## Question

what is the workup and treatment for lack of growth?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup and treatment of lack of growth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pathological short stature and establishing auxology. Then, I should review targeted history and examination. Next, I will consider initial laboratory screening and when to pursue endocrine-specific testing. After that, I must evaluate indications and protocols for GH stimulation testing, followed by imaging and genetic evaluation when appropriate. I will then outline diagnostic categorization and indications for therapy, detail pediatric and transition/adult GH dosing, monitoring and safety, and finally address transition retesting and long-term surveillance, verifying key thresholds and citing high-quality guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm how to define and quantify "lack of growth". Short stature is typically defined as height less than −2 standard deviations from the mean for age and sex, and I should calculate the height SDS, compare it with mid-parental target height, and assess growth velocity over at least 6 to 12 months to distinguish pathologic growth failure from normal variants; a delayed bone age relative to chronological age can support constitutional delay but does not exclude pathology, so I should be careful not to over-interpret it without the broader context. Hold on, I should verify the referral logic too: distance from target height, height deflection, and being short for both population and target height are among the most sensitive auxological criteria highlighted in European consensus work, even if practice adherence is variable across centers [^111GqLjG].

> Next, I should review the history and physical examination in detail. I need to check prenatal and perinatal parameters, including birth weight and length to identify SGA, family heights and pubertal timing, nutrition, chronic disease symptoms, and medication exposures, while also looking for disproportion, dysmorphic features, midline anomalies, and pubertal stage, because these may point toward genetic syndromes, skeletal dysplasias, or pituitary disorders requiring targeted evaluation or early genetic referral [^114tmUrg] [^116NqTnp]. Wait, let me verify that dysmorphic or disproportionate findings change the pathway: yes, such features should prompt earlier genetic evaluation rather than default endocrine testing alone, given the expanding spectrum of genetic etiologies of short stature and their management implications [^114tmUrg].

> I will now examine the initial laboratory screen to rule out common non-endocrine causes before specialized testing. A careful panel generally includes a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, celiac serology with tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA, and thyroid function with TSH and free T4; in girls with unexplained short stature I should confirm a karyotype to exclude Turner syndrome, and I should not forget to obtain a standardized bone age if not already done, because missing these basics can lead to delayed diagnosis of treatable conditions like celiac disease or hypothyroidism [^116NqTnp] [^113Pvjk3]. Hold on, I should verify adherence issues: real-world studies show that these foundational tests are too often omitted in referred patients, underscoring the need for a disciplined first-line workup before moving to GH-focused evaluations [^117Uc8pg].

> Let me consider when and how to assess the GH–IGF axis after the initial screen. I should confirm that serum IGF-1, interpreted using age- and pubertal stage–appropriate normative data and the same assay over time when feasible, is a practical screening tool; a low IGF-1 can suggest GHD or GH insensitivity, but a normal IGF-1 does not exclude GHD, so I must not prematurely rule out GHD on that basis alone, especially in the presence of auxologic red flags [^1149SdXz]. I need to check whether adding IGFBP-3 helps: yes, it can provide supportive information when IGF-1 is low or borderline, and in SGA pathways, guidelines advise measuring thyroid function and IGF-1 first and reserving GH stimulation for those with suspected GHD, which aligns with a tiered approach [^114exbkS].

> Now, I should review dynamic GH testing, since random GH levels are uninterpretable due to pulsatility. In adults and transition patients, the insulin tolerance test is the gold standard using a peak GH cut-point of about 5 mcg/L, but it is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or in the elderly, so I must ensure safety and pre-replacement of other pituitary axes before testing; alternatives include the glucagon stimulation test with BMI-appropriate cut-points and the oral macimorelin test with a validated GH cut-point, and random GH or IGF-1 alone should not be used to diagnose AGHD outside of specific high-certainty scenarios [^116E8L2g] [^113Vs2mP] [^113KtVzR] [^112qgphw]. Hmm, wait a minute, the trace listed a macimorelin GH cut-point as " ≤ 2.8 mg/L", which looks like an incorrect unit; I should correct that to a GH cut-point around 2.8 ng/mL to 5.1 ng/mL depending on assay and protocol, with 2.8 ng/mL commonly cited, not mg/L, to avoid orders-of-magnitude error in interpretation [^116E8L2g]. For children, I should confirm that two different abnormal stimulation tests are generally required to diagnose isolated GHD, recognizing poor reproducibility and the influence of age, puberty, and BMI on peak GH responses, which is why priming and context are important in pediatric protocols [^116yHv6E].

> Hold on, I should verify when imaging and genetics become necessary. If I confirm GHD, multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, or have neurologic or visual symptoms, a pituitary MRI is indicated to evaluate for structural lesions such as pituitary stalk interruption syndrome or tumors, and in certain high-probability situations with structural lesions and multiple deficits plus low IGF-1, further GH stimulation testing may be unnecessary for diagnosis in adults and transition patients; parallel to this, when syndromic features or disproportion are present, targeted genetic testing with microarray or phenotype-guided panels, and secondarily exome sequencing if negative, can yield actionable diagnoses [^11321bzG] [^114tmUrg]. Let me double-check that GH–IGF axis gene defects are part of the targeted strategy in selected phenotypes: yes, gene-directed testing for GH1, GHRHR, IGF1, or IGF1R is considered when phenotype suggests these mechanisms, but broad panels often precede single-gene approaches today [^114tmUrg].

> Next, I should categorize the diagnosis to map to treatment indications. Categories include isolated GHD, multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies often linked to structural causes, persistent short stature after SGA birth when catch-up fails by 2 to 4 years depending on the threshold, genetic syndromes such as Turner or Noonan, and normal variants like familial short stature or constitutional delay, each of which carries different treatment thresholds and monitoring requirements; importantly, certain adult and transition patients with ≥ 3 other pituitary hormone deficits, organic lesions, and low IGF-1 can be diagnosed with AGHD without further stimulation testing, whereas relying on only two deficits plus low IGF-1 is insufficient to establish AGHD [^1122XxZJ] [^117JbjT4] [^114Rnmtv]. But wait, I should ensure bone age interpretation is not used in isolation to label constitutional delay and dismiss pathology; bone age must be integrated with auxology and clinical context to avoid missed diagnoses [^116NqTnp].

> I will now outline initiation of GH therapy with attention to dosing nuances. In short children born SGA, I should start with 0.033 mg/kg/day and avoid starting at 0.067 mg/kg/day because higher initial dosing elevates IGF-1 to around or above +2 SDS without improving adult height, and dosing by IGF-1 titration alone underperforms fixed dosing; I need to keep serum IGF-1 at or below +2 SDS while monitoring linear growth and pubertal progression systematically. Let me verify adult and transition starting doses and targets: begin low, typically 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, titrating to maintain IGF-1 in the age-adjusted normal range while using the same assay when feasible, and ensure other pituitary hormone replacements are optimized before and during GH therapy to interpret IGF-1 correctly and to minimize adverse effects [^114stkq4] [^111Hy8dK] [^113Vs2mP].

> Next, I should review how to monitor response and adjust therapy, confirming numeric targets. In pediatric SGA treatment, I expect a first-year height velocity increase exceeding 0.5 SDS; if the response is inadequate, I must verify adherence, technique, thyroid status, nutrition, and comorbidity before considering dose escalation within the approved range while maintaining IGF-1 no higher than +2 SDS, and I should avoid stopping after an initial response because catch-down growth can ensue [^111Hy8dK]. I need to check the adult monitoring cadence: reassess IGF-1, fasting glucose and HbA1c, fasting lipids, anthropometrics, and relevant pituitary axes at 6 to 12 month intervals once on maintenance dosing to balance efficacy and safety over time [^114stkq4].

> I should confirm the transition protocol from pediatric to adult care. Most individuals with childhood-onset idiopathic isolated GHD should be retested with GH stimulation after attaining near-adult height and being off GH for at least 1 to 3 months to determine persistence, using ITT when safe or alternatives such as glucagon stimulation with BMI-appropriate cut-points or macimorelin when ITT is contraindicated; exceptions include those with genetic causes, structural lesions with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, or very low IGF-1 off therapy, in whom persistent GHD can be documented without further provocative testing [^111dTfhD] [^11321bzG]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical evaluation at retesting: body composition, BMD, and lipids should be assessed around the time of GH discontinuation and retesting to individualize the decision to resume adult GH therapy if deficiency persists [^114KsXio].

> Let me now think about long-term surveillance and special high-risk groups. I need to ensure cardiovascular risk monitoring with fasting lipids and blood pressure, metabolic surveillance with glucose indices, periodic BMD assessments, and closer follow-up for survivors of structural pituitary or brain tumors in transition given their higher burden of skeletal and cardiometabolic risk markers; standard cancer screenings should continue as age-appropriate while GH therapy proceeds with caution but is not generally linked to increased de novo malignancy risk in guideline summaries [^114VTtPt] [^112ei1Dk]. But wait, for SGA and other specific populations like Turner or Prader–Willi syndromes, I should verify syndrome-specific surveillance needs and earlier intervention windows to optimize outcomes with GH therapy, integrating endocrine and multidisciplinary care pathways [^114exbkS].

> Finally, I should summarize the key principles to ensure I have not missed anything critical. A disciplined pathway moves from accurate auxology and bone age to targeted history and examination, first-line labs to exclude common and treatable conditions, context-aware IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 interpretation, judicious use of GH stimulation testing with attention to safety, imaging and genetics when indicated, diagnosis-specific GH initiation with dosing anchored to evidence-based thresholds, structured monitoring with assay consistency, and thoughtful transition retesting with appropriate cut-points and exceptions, all supported by high-quality pediatric and adult endocrine guidelines [^116NqTnp] [^1149SdXz] [^111Hy8dK] [^111cB47M].

---

The workup for lack of growth begins with **accurate auxology** (height, weight, growth velocity [^112rYyLr], and bone age) [^116NqTnp] and a focused history/physical to identify systemic, endocrine, genetic, or nutritional causes. Initial labs include **CBC, ESR/CRP, CMP, TSH/free T4, IGF-1/IGFBP-3, celiac serology, and urinalysis**; add GH stimulation testing only if GHD is suspected [^114exbkS] celiac serology [^113Pvjk3], and urinalysis; add GH stimulation testing only if GHD is suspected [^114SjyMc]. Genetic testing (karyotype, microarray, or exome) is indicated for unexplained short stature, dysmorphism, or suspected syndromes [^114tmUrg] [^111AUmFc]. For **management**, target the cause: nutritional rehabilitation for malnutrition, hormone replacement for endocrine deficits, and GH therapy for confirmed GHD or eligible conditions (e.g. Turner, Prader-Willi, SGA) [^112twqe4] with regular monitoring of growth, IGF-1, and adverse effects [^114exbkS] [^111Hy8dK].

- **Celiac disease serology**: tissue transglutaminase IgA, total IgA [^113Pvjk3].
- **Urinalysis**: renal disease [^116NqTnp].

---

### Specialized endocrine testing

Specialized endocrine testing includes **growth hormone stimulation tests** when GHD is suspected, using agents such as insulin (insulin tolerance test), glucagon, arginine, or clonidine [^116yHv6E]. Assess adrenal function with a **cortisol stimulation test** if adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Evaluate pubertal disorders by measuring **gonadotropins (LH, FSH) and sex steroids** in cases of delayed or precocious puberty [^116NqTnp].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies include **bone age assessment** with a left hand/wrist radiograph to assess skeletal maturity [^116NqTnp]. Brain MRI evaluates **hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities** and other structural lesions [^1153f2Hm]. A **skeletal survey** is indicated when skeletal dysplasia is suspected [^114tmUrg].

---

## Genetic testing

Genetic testing includes **karyotype analysis** for Turner syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities, and **chromosomal microarray** to detect copy number variations and microdeletions [^114SjyMc]. For unexplained short stature or suspected genetic syndromes, targeted gene panels or whole-exome sequencing are indicated [^114tmUrg] [^111AUmFc].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Nutritional interventions

Nutritional interventions include **dietary counseling** to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake and address deficiencies, nutritional supplementation for malnutrition or specific deficiencies, and management of underlying gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease [^113kRgqF].

---

### Hormonal therapies

Hormonal therapies include **growth hormone therapy** for confirmed GHD and eligible conditions such as Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, and SGA without catch-up growth [^111Hy8dK] [^112twqe4]. Initiate **thyroid hormone replacement** for hypothyroidism and **glucocorticoid replacement** for adrenal insufficiency, and use **sex steroid therapy** for delayed puberty [^114exbkS].

---

### Management of chronic systemic diseases

For chronic systemic diseases, management focuses on treating the underlying **conditions** — such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, renal disease, or cardiac disease — and typically requires a **multidisciplinary approach** involving a pediatric endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and nutritionist [^112rYyLr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up include **regular assessment** of height, weight, growth velocity, and bone age [^111Hy8dK]. During hormonal therapy, monitor IGF-1 levels and adverse effects, and adjust treatment based on response and side effects [^114exbkS]. Provide psychosocial support through counseling and support groups.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Indications for specialist referral include **height below -2 SD or growth velocity below -1 SD** [^116NqTnp], suspected endocrine disorders (GHD, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and suspected genetic syndromes with dysmorphic features or skeletal abnormalities. Persistent, unexplained growth failure despite initial evaluation also warrants referral [^1122XxZJ].

---

The workup for lack of growth includes **clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging, and genetic testing**. Treatment targets the underlying cause, with nutritional support, hormonal therapy, and management of chronic diseases, and regular monitoring and specialist referral are essential [^114tmUrg].

### A review of guidelines for use of growth hormone in pediatric and transition patients [^112twqe4]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Growth hormone (GH) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pediatric patients with disorders of growth failure or short stature and in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and HIV/AIDS wasting and cachexia. For pediatric patients, guidelines for the use of GH have been developed by several organizations that have identified specific criteria for initiating GH therapy for each FDA-approved indication. Guidelines for adults have also been developed and include recommendations for transition (adolescent) patients with GHD. These patients are often treated with GH as children but may require continued treatment as young adults to attain full skeletal mineralization and improve cardiovascular risk factors.

Adult and pediatric guidelines are supported by efficacy and safety studies, which show that, when started at an early age, GH treatment can increase growth velocity and that GH is safe and well-tolerated. We summarize the guidelines that are available for all FDA-approved indications among pediatric and transition patients. Adherence to these guidelines will help to ensure that patients with disorders of growth failure or short stature receive the necessary therapy to increase linear growth and transition smoothly to healthy adulthood.

### Approach to the patient with short stature: Genetic testing [^114tmUrg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The first step in evaluating a child with short stature is to determine whether their growth parameters, in the context of their history, are abnormal or represent a variant of normal growth. If growth is deemed abnormal, systemic and hormonal tests are likely required, followed by more targeted assessments, such as a skeletal survey and/or genetic screening involving karyotype or microarray analysis. In a minority of cases where a diagnosis has not been established, detailed genetic analysis may be necessary; currently, exome sequencing using targeted panels relevant to the phenotype is the most commonly employed test. Clinical scenarios illustrate how genetic testing can establish a molecular diagnosis, significantly contributing to the management of a child with short stature. New genetic causes for short stature are frequently identified, and the clinical spectrum for known genes is continuously expanding. We advocate for establishing an international repository for short stature conditions, which will promote the dissemination of knowledge and aid in defining the clinical spectrum for both new and established conditions.

### Normal and abnormal growth in the pediatric patient [^112rYyLr]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Proper growth is a marker of the overall health of a child. Growth monitoring in infancy and childhood is a central part of preventative child health programs. For early recognition of pathological causes of growth failure, accurate measurements of height and weight using standardized methods are fundamental. The general pediatrician is a key participant, as they provide the auxological data to determine if further testing is needed. This review provides an outline for the general pediatrician for proper auxological measurements, normal variants versus abnormal growth, initial testing for abnormal growth, and when to refer to a pediatric endocrinologist.

### Evaluation of short and tall stature in children [^116NqTnp]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

In the context of diagnostic investigations for Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly concerning growth assessment, the AAFP 2025 guidelines advise comparing bone age with chronological age. This comparison helps narrow the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with short and tall stature. A bone age that is more than two standard deviations (SDs) less than the chronological age indicates delayed bone development. Conversely, a bone age greater than the chronological age by more than two SDs is considered advanced.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^114exbkS]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to postnatal infant surveillance (evaluation of short stature), ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend measuring thyroid hormones and serum IGF-1 concentrations to determine the cause of short stature. Consider obtaining IGFBP-3 in case of low IGF-1 concentrations. Obtain GH stimulation testing only if GHD is suspected.

### Growth failure in adolescents: Etiology, the role of pubertal timing and most useful criteria for diagnostic workup [^115dDtUz]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, the role of pubertal timing, and the most useful criteria for diagnostic workup in adolescents with growth failure.

- **Methods**: Adolescents (n = 182) aged 10.0–18.0 years underwent a standardized diagnostic protocol. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) was defined as late pubertal onset or a Tanner stage less than -2 SDS. Dutch and Finnish criteria for growth monitoring were retrospectively assessed.

- **Results**: In 13 children (7.1%) a specific diagnosis could be established. CDGP was diagnosed in 10% of patients aged ≥ 13 (girls) or ≥ 14 years (boys). Sensitivity to detect pathologic causes was 85% and 62% for, respectively, Dutch and Finnish criteria for growth monitoring as used in younger children, but specificity was low (55%-59%).

- **Conclusions**: In adolescents, pathological causes for growth failure and pubertal delay are common, and we recommend a combination of height SDS, distance to THSDS, and growth deflection for deciding on further diagnostic testing.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^111dTfhD]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to the transition to adult care, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend retesting for GHD with GH stimulation tests in most transition patients, especially those with idiopathic isolated GHD and serum IGF-1 SDS < 0, when longitudinal growth is complete. This testing should occur at least one month after the discontinuation of pediatric recombinant human GH therapy to determine the need for continued recombinant human GH replacement in adulthood.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^111ARjQw]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective observational study in the outpatient clinics of the general pediatric departments at both a university hospital (Erasmus MC – Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam) and a general hospital (Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem). In both clinics, the DCG was well known and used during the study period. All new patients referred for short stature between January 1998 and December 2002 were identified retrospectively. Children in whom the cause of growth retardation was already known were excluded. A previously described problem-oriented patient classification system was used to identify the children in the university hospital. In the general hospital, the children were identified by a local registration system, consisting of a handwritten registry of reasons for referral of all new patients.

The following information was obtained from the medical records:

- **Patient demographics and history**: date of birth, date of first presentation at the outpatient clinic, gender, ethnicity
- **Perinatal information**: birth weight, length, gestation, maternal obstetric problems, etc.
- **Family and clinical information**: family history, clinical presentation (symptoms and signs), information on puberty
- **Growth and developmental data**: longitudinal height measurements until the first presentation at the outpatient clinic
- **Diagnostic evaluations**: laboratory test results, radiological and pathological evaluations, final diagnosis

If ethnicity was not recorded, it was assessed based on the patient's first and family name according to an algorithm reported earlier.

The DCG addresses five stages in the analysis of short stature. First of all, it focuses on seven auxological referral criteria.

### Sex difference in paediatric growth hormone deficiency: Fact or fiction [^116ZhWBX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

**Short stature assessment: Importance**: Short stature, defined as a height of less than the 2.3rd percentile or 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and sex, is a common indication for referral to paediatric endocrinology clinics. In addition to the social implications of height, short stature with poor growth may be an indication of underlying systemic illness. Though the estimated prevalence of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is approximately 1:4000–10,000, the ultimate aim of a short stature evaluation in children who are growing below their genetic potential is to exclude this rare entity. An integral part of patient evaluation, growth hormone provocative tests are widely used in clinical practice worldwide during short stature workup to diagnose GHD.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^114TE74i]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

After growth hormone deficiency (GHD), short stature following small for gestational age (SGA) birth is the second most common indication for growth hormone (GH) treatment. Initiating treatment at a young age is one of the most important factors predicting a favorable growth response. Therefore, early identification and referral of children with persistent short stature after SGA birth is crucial.

In the United States and Latin America, GH treatment can begin at the age of 2 years. In contrast, children in Japan and Europe may start treatment after the age of 3 years and 4 years, respectively. The indication for GH treatment based on height standard deviation scores (SDS) varies by country, with cutoffs ranging between −2.0 and −2.5 SDS. Notably, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States does not set a height SDS criterion.

- **Growth velocity requirements**: A growth velocity of less than 0 SDS is required by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMA) and the Japanese agency (PMDA), but not in the United States and Latin America. Additionally, the EMA mandates a distance to mid-parental height (MPH) of −1 SDS.

- **Criteria for GH treatment**: Criteria mostly include:
	- Documented small birth weight and/or birth length (< −2 SDS for gestational age)
	- Persistent short stature (< −2.0 SDS)
	- Age beyond which catch-up growth is unlikely (3–4 years)
	- Growing at an average or subnormal rate for age
	- Ruling out other causes for short stature
	- Absence of clinical features suggestive of a dysmorphic syndrome, except for Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS).

This comprehensive understanding ensures that GH treatment is appropriately administered to eligible children, improving their growth outcomes.

### Are factors at diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in childhood associated with persistence of growth hormone deficiency into adult life [^113yAyHn]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

A proportion of children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) continue to experience GHD as young adults. At the time of writing, no markers from childhood have been shown to have predictive value in determining the persistence of GHD into adult life. We examined the hypothesis in 31 patients that variables present at the time of diagnosis of childhood-onset GHD, or those related to the early response to growth hormone (GH) therapy, are associated with the likelihood of persistence of GHD.

The results show that, as previously demonstrated, children with GHD are more likely to have persistent severe GHD in adult life when the diagnosis is associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies (p = 0.02), abnormal pituitary neuroimaging (p = 0.003), induced puberty (p = 0.001), early age of diagnosis (p = 0.03), and a lower peak GH response at the first dynamic GH test in childhood (p = 0.02). However, there are no associations of persistent severe GHD with the pattern of pretreatment growth or growth response to GH treatment in the initial phase.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: Expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^113kRgqF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Faltering growth in infants and children under 2 years of age is a common problem regularly seen by healthcare professionals. It has multiple causes and occurs due to disease-related and non-disease-related factors, and in low-, middle-, and high-income settings. However, in all settings, it is essential to detect faltering growth, address underlying causes, and support catch-up growth where this is indicated.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^114SjyMc]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

- **Endocrine workup**: To determine the cause of short stature, an endocrine workup that includes thyroid hormone and serum IGF-I concentrations is recommended. If low IGF-I concentrations are found, IGFBP-3 should also be assessed. A GH stimulation test is indicated only for those suspected of having GH deficiency.

- **Clinical evaluation**: When dysmorphic features, major malformations, microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or signs of skeletal dysplasia are present, evaluation by a clinical geneticist should be considered.

- **Genetic testing**: Genetic testing should be considered for children born small for gestational age (SGA) with persistent short stature, with or without skeletal disproportion, when no other cause is identified.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^117WVQuZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

As abnormal growth might be the first manifestation of undetected diseases, it is important to have accurate referral criteria and a proper diagnostic work-up. In the present paper we evaluate the diagnostic work-up in secondary health care according to existing consensus guidelines and study the frequency of underlying medical disorders.

- **Methods**: Data on growth and additional diagnostic procedures were collected from medical records of new patients referred for short stature to the outpatient clinics of the general paediatric departments of two hospitals (Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam and Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem) between January 1998 and December 2002. As the Dutch Consensus Guideline (DCG) is the only guideline addressing referral criteria as well as diagnostic work-up, the analyses were based on its seven auxological referral criteria to determine the characteristics of children who are incorrectly referred and the adequacy of workup of those who are referred.

- **Results**: Twenty-four percent of children older than 3 years were inappropriately referred (NCR). Of the correctly referred children, 74–88% were short corrected for parental height, 40–61% had a height SDS < -2.5 and 21% showed height deflection (Delta HSDS < -0.25/yr or Delta HSDS < -1). In none of the children was a complete detailed routine diagnostic work-up performed and in more than 30% no routine laboratory examination was done at all. Pathologic causes of short stature were found in 27 children (5%).

- **Conclusion**: Existing guidelines for the work-up of children with suspected growth failure require further evaluation and improvement to ensure comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.

### Genetic evaluation of short stature [^111AUmFc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Context**: Genetics plays a major role in determining an individual's height. Although there are many monogenic disorders that lead to perturbations in growth and result in short stature, there is still no consensus as to the role that genetic diagnostics should play in the evaluation of a child with short stature.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A search of PubMed was performed, focusing on the genetic diagnosis of short stature as well as on specific diagnostic subgroups included in this article. Consensus guidelines were reviewed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There are a multitude of rare genetic causes of severe short stature. There is no high-quality evidence to define the optimal approach to the genetic evaluation of short stature. We review genetic etiologies of a number of diagnostic subgroups and propose an algorithm for genetic testing based on these subgroups.

- **Conclusion**: Advances in genomic technologies are revolutionizing the diagnostic approach to short stature. Endocrinologists must become facile with the use of genetic testing in order to identify the various monogenic disorders that present with short stature.

### Selecting short-statured children needing growth hormone testing: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule [^113U2aYV]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Shortness or decreasing growth is a frequent reason for pediatric consultations. After ruling out other causes of short stature, such as intestinal malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, and hypothyroidism, the possibility of growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) is often considered. This deficiency is associated with excess mortality and substantial morbidity, and it can be treated. Therefore, many children are referred by their physicians to specialist departments to test for GHD. Testing is based on the measurement of stimulated GH secretion. The diagnosis is generally based on two GH peaks < 10 ng/mL (or 20 mUI/mL). GHD cannot be considered certain unless there are also one or more of the following confirmatory markers: familial GHD, other deficiencies of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, micropenis, neonatal hypoglycemia, abnormalities of the median line, and pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

GH stimulation tests are invasive, expensive, and, in view of the risk of severe hypoglycemia, potentially dangerous. Moreover, they are normal in most cases and thus retrospectively unnecessary. It would therefore be useful to identify predictive factors of GHD to avoid these unnecessary tests. A selection strategy for GH stimulation tests must offer sensitivity close to 100% for certain GHD, given the need to begin treatment rapidly. It must also be sufficiently specific.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult growth hormone deficiency, specifically with respect to provocative testing, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an insulin tolerance test as the gold standard to establish the diagnosis of AGHD using a peak GH cut-point of 5 mcg/L. This test is recognized for its limited use due to safety concerns, laboriousness, and the potential to cause severe hypoglycemia. It is contraindicated in certain patients, such as the elderly and those with seizure disorders or cardio/cerebrovascular disease.

- **Results**:

- **Patients**: Between January 1998 and December 2002, 742 children were referred to the two hospitals for short stature (university hospital: n = 467, general hospital: n = 275). Two hundred children were excluded either because the cause of growth retardation was already known before referral, the medical records were missing, or there was another reason for referral than short stature. Hence, 542 cases were suitable for analysis. Fifty-nine children were under the age of 3 years at the time of referral and were analyzed separately. According to referral criteria mentioned in the DCG, 76.4% (77.1% in the university and 73.9% in the general hospital) of the children older than 3 years were correctly referred (CR). In 5.6% of children (5.7% in the university and 5.2% in the general hospital), there was insufficient information to assess whether the referral met the criteria (not classifiable, NC), and in 18.0%, the children did not meet the referral criteria (not correctly referred, NCR) according to the DCG (17.1% in the university and 20.9% in the general hospital).

Details of all patients are shown in the study; the groups were significantly different between the two hospitals for gender, ethnicity, height SDS (HSDS) at the time of referral, and target height.

- **General characteristics of the study population in the university hospital (n = 398) and the general hospital (n = 144)**: Details on height standard deviation score (HSDS) and target height standard deviation score (THSDS) are compared for both hospitals.

### Genetic characterization of short stature patients with overlapping features of growth hormone insensitivity syndromes [^115QNq8D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical and biochemical presentations of patients with known GH–IGF-I axis gene defects can be useful diagnostic tools to aid genetic differentiation. Diagnostic pointers include birth weight and length, head circumference, facial dysmorphisms, the degree of postnatal growth failure, presence of immune deficiency, and GH and IGF-I levels. GH–IGF-I assessment should be considered in all undiagnosed short children. However, in those with clinical features consistent with a specific phenotype, such as achondroplasia, GH–IGF-I assessment would not routinely be indicated.

Comprehensive algorithms for targeting genetic investigations have previously been published. However, there has been no emphasis on differentiating patients with known genetic variants in the GH–IGF-I axis from those with overlapping disorders external to the GH–IGF-I axis. This is likely due to the rarity of many of these disorders and the previous lack of association with GHI. Furthermore, the absence of a genetic diagnosis within the GH–IGF-I axis does not rule out the possibility of an undefined molecular abnormality in this axis. Our data demonstrate the overlap between these groups, proving that clinical differentiation is challenging. However, genetic, biochemical, and clinical evaluation for other overlapping disorders may prove beneficial to improving the diagnostic yield in undiagnosed short stature with GHI features.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^112pTNBR]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

In 80 children (14.8%), the diagnosis of persistent short stature after being born SGA (small for gestational age) could be made based on recorded birth size, although only 17 children (3.3%) were classified as such by the physicians. Pathologic causes of short stature were found in 27 children (5%) (see Table 6). A large share of these were due to Turner syndrome, GHD (growth hormone deficiency), and celiac disease.

- **Syndromes**: Noonan syndrome and Leri-Weill syndrome (2 cases)
- **Anaemia**: 3 cases
- **Skeletal diseases**: 4 cases
- **Emotional deprivation**: 1 case

Three children born SGA also had a pathologic cause for short stature (celiac disease, Turner syndrome, and GHD). These three were classified under their pathologic cause and not under SGA in Table 6.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^117Uc8pg]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

As abnormal growth might be the first manifestation of undetected diseases, it is important to have accurate referral criteria and a proper diagnostic work-up. In the present paper, we evaluate the diagnostic work-up in secondary health care according to existing consensus guidelines and study the frequency of underlying medical disorders.

- **Methods**: Data on growth and additional diagnostic procedures were collected from medical records of new patients referred for short stature to the outpatient clinics of the general pediatric departments of two hospitals: Erasmus MC – Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, and Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem, between January 1998 and December 2002. As the Dutch Consensus Guideline (DCG) is the only guideline addressing referral criteria as well as diagnostic work-up, the analyses were based on its seven auxological referral criteria to determine the characteristics of children who are incorrectly referred and the adequacy of work-up of those who are referred.

- **Results**: Twenty-four percent of children older than 3 years were inappropriately referred (NCR). Of the correctly referred children, 74–88% were short corrected for parental height, 40–61% had a height SDS < -2.5, and 21% showed height deflection (Δ HSDS < -0.25/yr or Δ HSDS < -1). In none of the children was a complete detailed routine diagnostic work-up performed, and in more than 30% no routine laboratory examination was done at all. Pathologic causes of short stature were found in 27 children (5%).

- **Conclusion**: Existing guidelines for the work-up of children with suspected growth failure are not fully adhered to, leading to a significant portion of children being incorrectly referred and inadequately assessed.

### Approach to the growth hormone-deficient child during transition to adulthood [^113UoqJe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The observation that some adults with childhood-onset GH deficiency have low bone mineral density, low lean body mass, diminished quality of life, abnormal lipids, and impaired cardiac function, all of which may improve after treatment with GH, has prompted pediatric endocrinologists to reevaluate the practice of discontinuing GH in all patients after attainment of final adult height. The treatment of adolescents to prevent the metabolic complications of GH deficiency is an emerging practice. Studies addressing the evaluation and care of adolescents during this period and the benefits of GH in this setting are conflicting. Our approach in determining which adolescents to retest, when and how to test for persistent GH deficiency, and which subjects to treat is discussed in the context of available clinical data.

### Can growth hormone stimulation tests in children predict the response to growth hormone treatment [^11554KXw]? Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: The efficacy of growth hormone (GH) treatment in short, healthy children diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or idiopathic short stature (ISS) suggests an overlap between these two conditions. Although imperfect and inconsistent, GH stimulation testing (GHST) remains the primary diagnostic tool for differentiating GHD and ISS, influencing GH treatment eligibility and dosing. This study aims to assess the clinical significance of GHST by comparing the response to GH treatment in children diagnosed with GHD or ISS based on their GHST results.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted in an endocrine clinic at a tertiary pediatric referral center, comparing the response to GH treatment over three years in children diagnosed with GHD or ISS.

- **Results**: Two hundred ninety-one children treated with GH, including 97 children diagnosed with GHD and 194 with ISS, were included in the analysis. Height significantly improved, and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels increased independent of the GHST results, gender, or pubertal status (P < .001). When adjusting for dosage, height gain was not associated with the treatment indication, GHD or ISS, or GHST peak levels.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings indicate similar responses to GH treatment in children classified as GHD or ISS based on GHST. These results suggest that the pivotal role of GHST in diagnosing and treating short children should be reconsidered.

### Growth hormone deficiency and related disorders: Insights into causation, diagnosis, and treatment [^1153f2Hm]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Advances in molecular biology have led to the identification of mutations within several novel genes associated with the phenotype of isolated growth hormone deficiency, combined pituitary hormone deficiency, and syndromes such as septo-optic dysplasia. Progress has also been made in terms of the optimum diagnosis of disorders of stature and their treatment. The use of growth hormone for the treatment of adults with growth hormone deficiency and conditions such as Turner's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, and chronic renal failure has changed the practice of endocrinology, although cost-benefit implications remain to be established.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: Etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^111Hy8dK]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We recommend treating short children born SGA with a GH dose of 0.033 mg/kg/d. Only increase the GH dose if the growth response is unsatisfactory after ruling out causes such as nonadherence, hypothyroidism, unknown disease, or syndrome. If the growth response remains poor, the GH dose can be increased within the dose range until there is a satisfying growth response, ensuring serum IGF-I concentrations remain ≤ 2 SDS. We do not recommend starting with a GH dose of 0.067 mg/kg/d, as this results in high serum IGF-I concentrations (around or above +2 SDS) and yields a similar adult height as treatment with a dose of 0.033 mg/kg/d. GH dosing based on IGF-I titration results in a diminished growth response compared to treatment with a fixed GH dose. It is important to note that the IGF-I SDS is influenced by pubertal development in addition to age.

- **Clinical management during GH treatment**: It is essential to regularly monitor height, sitting height, weight, and pubertal Tanner stage. The first-year height increase under GH treatment should exceed 0.5 SDS. A French study showed that stopping GH treatment following a positive growth response for three years leads to catch-down growth and is not recommended. If growth response is inadequate, reevaluation is necessary, and the decision to discontinue GH treatment should be considered. Once adolescents reach near adult height, defined as a growth rate of < 1 cm/6 months along with closed epiphyses, GH treatment should be discontinued.

### Short stature: Making a crystal clear diagnosis [^116r7msZ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Short stature is a common presentation in pediatric practice. Rickets can lead to poor growth, and finding the underlying cause of rickets can, at times, be challenging.

- **Case presentation**: The child was initially referred due to parental concerns of delayed walking, bowed legs, waddling gait, and faltering growth. She was noted to have features of rickets. Bone profile and renal functions were reported to be within the normal range. However, it was later noted that adult values for inorganic phosphate had been given for reference ranges. Following a series of investigations, the underlying diagnosis for all her problems was made.

- **Discussion**: This case demonstrates the complex diagnostic journey of a child whose presentation was not typical of the rare disorder. Unusually, the patient had no symptoms of polyuria or polydipsia, and urine osmolality was normal.

### L-DOPA test in the diagnosis of childhood short stature: Evaluation of growth hormone peaks over time [^116yHv6E]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) diagnosis in childhood is based on clinical and auxological assessments, combined with biochemical tests. GHD may present as an isolated problem or in combination with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. Currently, although most studies show poor sensitivity and specificity, in children, GH stimulation tests are fundamental in diagnosing GHD because of the pulsatile nature of GH production, meaning its random measurement cannot be used for diagnostic purposes. A 12‐ or 24‐hour GH profile may have a role in the diagnosis of GHD by reducing false‐positive stimulation tests. In provocative tests, a stimulus for GH production is administered parenterally or orally, and the GH response is subsequently evaluated. The protocols for GHD diagnosis vary substantially in European countries and in the United States. No single test is sensitive and specific enough to confirm a diagnosis. Conventional GH stimulation tests have low specificity and poor reproducibility, and results can be influenced by factors such as age, gender, puberty, nutritional status, and body weight, which modulate the secretion of GH. Clinicians can improve the reliability of testing by taking these factors into account. Moreover, stimulation tests may have side effects because of the drugs used as stimuli. Different pharmacological agents generate different mean GH peak sizes. In suspected isolated GHD, two different GH stimulation tests are required, and both tests must be abnormal to define the presence of a GH deficiency. There is no consensus on a specific test protocol.

### The diagnostic work-up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^111Pcu3M]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Of all 27 children with a pathologic outcome, seven were referred for other reasons, including anemia (2), coughing (2), delayed closure of fontanel (1), health check after adoption (1), poor weight gain (1), and poor food intake (1), in addition to their short stature. Five children exhibited dysmorphic features at the time of referral, including two children with Turner syndrome, one child with Noonan syndrome, one child with achondroplasia, and one child with partial GHD. Additionally, three children were disproportionate, including two children with achondroplasia and one child with Leri-Weill syndrome.

Six children had already been seen by a specialist before referral: two for short stature (referred for a second opinion), one for hydrocephalus, one for exostoses, one for neurofibromatosis and glioma of the medulla oblongata, and one for ASD. However, none of the children had been previously investigated for short stature. The family or medical history did not assist in determining the cause for any of the children. Most of the correctly referred children with pathology complied with a deviant HSDScorr (83.4%), followed by absolute height (see Table 7). The only child with a pathologic cause that was incorrectly referred had a height SDS of -1.7 SDS at the time of referral and was referred because of its short stature in combination with an undiagnosed condition.

### Confirming the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and transitioning the care of patients with childhood-onset GHD [^111YmQoJ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) diagnosed in childhood may persist into adult life. After attainment of final height, retesting of the patient's growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis using the adult GHD diagnostic criteria should be performed after an appropriate interval of 1–3 months off GH therapy. At the time of retesting, other pituitary hormones and serum IGF-I levels should also be measured. The opportunity should be taken to assess body composition, bone mineral density, and fasting lipid and insulin levels.

Patients with severe, long-standing, multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, genetic defects, or severe organic GHD can be excluded from GH retesting. When the diagnosis of adult GHD is established, continuation of GH therapy can be recommended unless there is a known risk of diabetes mellitus or malignancy. The patient's transition to GH replacement in adulthood should be arranged as a close collaboration between the pediatric and adult endocrinologists, who should discuss the reinitiation of treatment with the patient.

### Approach to the patient with achondroplasia-new considerations for diagnosis, management, and treatment [^113t3PgN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Discussion on management by pediatric endocrinologist**: Pediatric endocrinologists are experts in managing growth and genetic growth disorders; however, during their training, there is limited education and exposure to the management of skeletal dysplasias. The emergence of growth hormone as an effective treatment for Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome led to the opportunity and need for pediatric endocrinologists to become experts in managing patients with these genetic conditions. Today, pediatric endocrinologists are the most common specialists seeing these patients and others for growth hormone treatment. Prior to vosoritide, the medical home for a child with achondroplasia was rarely pediatric endocrinology; however, this paradigm may be shifting or shared with medical geneticists after the approval of this growth medication.

For this 3-week-old whose mother is eager to start treatment, the pediatric endocrinologist needs to confirm the diagnosis, counsel the family, and manage expectations of medical treatment along with ensuring routine surveillance is performed. Since the pediatric endocrinologist will be writing the prescription for vosoritide, they may be the physician the family sees most often. The pediatric endocrinologist naturally becomes the medical home in this situation for the patient and family. Given that, it becomes their responsibility to monitor for potential complications related to achondroplasia. This is especially important in children younger than 5, as the risk of sudden death is 50 times higher than in the general population.

### Network approach to the child with primary intestinal failure [^113Pcc2s]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Intestinal failure (IF) is a rare condition resulting from short gut and other heterogeneous intestinal diseases. Major centers in Italy merged into a national network to build common diagnostic and management approaches and to investigate the natural history of IF. Gastroenterological reference centers with specific expertise in intestinal morphology, diagnosis of autoimmune conditions, intestinal microbiology, and parenteral nutrition were identified to act as consultants to the network. These centers of expertise provided specific diagnostic approaches while ensuring high technical standards.

The approach allowed each center to learn from a larger cohort of patient samples. A database was set up to investigate the etiology, epidemiology, and natural history of IF. A common diagnostic algorithm for intractable diarrhea was designed. This process was largely based on electronic communication among centers and specimen shipping. Etiologic diagnosis was obtained in almost all cases of IF secondary to severe protracted diarrhea.

The study of the natural history of IF showed a close association between the etiology of IF and its outcome. The natural history of IF also provided the starting point for specific therapeutic approaches to its complications, such as parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis and catheter-related sepsis. The network approach to IF provides an effective model to optimize resources and prospectively investigate the natural history of IF, essential steps to design interventions, including intestinal transplantation, and improve the outcome of IF.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^111GqLjG]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

In both hospitals, most children with pathology older than three years complied with the HSDScorr rule, followed by the absolute height rule and height deflection rule. This result is contrary to most findings in literature, where absolute height is referred to as the most important criterion for abnormal growth. It concurs, however, with the observation by Van Buuren et al. that the best decision rule to detect children with Turner syndrome, one of the major causes of short stature, is the distance between height SDS and target height.

In the eight children with pathology referred before the age of 3 years (CD (n = 3), GHD (n = 1), anaemia (n = 2), skeletal diseases (n = 2), and emotional deprivation (n = 1)), both HSDScorr and absolute height seemed important criteria. According to the English consensus, these children would, however, not have been diagnosed at this point, as it recommends a single measurement at the age of 5 years old. As these children did not reach the age of 5 years in our study, we are not able to evaluate whether they would have been picked up in the English system, but we can surely say that there would have been a delay. Especially in children with GHD and celiac disease, early diagnosis and treatment are important for its prognosis.

In order to improve the referral criteria for growth monitoring with optimal cut-off points, we believe that more studies, similar to the recent report on Turner syndrome, are required, with specific attention for children under the age of 3 years.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^115R6Myw]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate consensus guidelines on poor growth in secondary health care and their outcome in terms of pathology. According to the referral criteria mentioned in the DCG, 76.4% (284 in the university and 85 in the general hospital) of the children older than 3 years were correctly referred. In both hospitals, "short for target height and population (HSDScorr)" appears to be the criteria most complied with, followed by absolute height and height deflection. The approach towards the diagnostic workup was significantly different between the two hospitals, but in none of the children was a complete detailed routine diagnostic workup performed. Pathologic causes for short stature were found in 27 children (5%), and in 80 children (14.8%), the short stature was classified as persistent short stature after being born SGA.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adult growth hormone deficiency, and more specifically with respect to transition to adult care, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend considering an insulin tolerance test (using a GH cut-point ≤ 5.0 mcg/L) in transition patients. Consider obtaining a glucagon stimulation test (using a GH cut-point of 3 mcg/L for patients with normal weight and overweight with a high pretest probability, and a lower GH cut-point of 1 mcg/L for patients with overweight with a low pretest probability and obesity) or a macimorelin test (using a GH cut-point ≤ 2.8 mg/L) if the insulin tolerance test is contraindicated or not feasible.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency in patients transitioning to adulthood using GH stimulation testing [^115r2KNa]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

To establish the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD), GH-deficient children transitioning to adulthood are evaluated by two separate stimuli two or more weeks after ceasing GH therapy. While 20–88% of children diagnosed with idiopathic GHD retest with normal values, those with proven genetic defects in GH production, secretion, or bioactivity and patients with panhypopituitarism consistently test deficient.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines GHD in adults by stimulated peak serum GH concentrations of less than 5 ng/ml if measured by polyclonal radioimmunoassays (RIA) or lower if measured by monoclonal assays. Some investigators define severe GHD by a peak GH concentration of less than 3 ng/ml.

- **Testing methodologies**: Adult responses to arginine and glucagon testing are similar to the responses to insulin tolerance testing. Clonidine, pyridostigmine, and galanin cause lesser peaks of GH. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) combined with arginine, GH releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6), or hexarelin leads to higher peak responses than GHRH alone. Thus, the choice of testing methods impacts the diagnosis of GHD in transition patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adult growth hormone deficiency, specifically with respect to monitoring for comorbidities, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring cardiovascular parameters. These include fasting lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) at 6- to 12-month intervals in patients with adult growth hormone deficiency. More detailed examinations, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and carotid echo-Doppler, should be considered if clinically indicated.

Many overlapping disorders have significant comorbidities, and a definitive genetic diagnosis allows screening tests to be initiated. A diagnosis also informs prognosis, clinical management, and supports genetic counseling. Advancing molecular knowledge of the GHI continuum has likely benefits, such as facilitating targeted clinical therapies and preventing the inappropriate use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in premalignant conditions.

### Selecting short-statured children needing growth hormone testing: derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule [^117C6e1X]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Some of the patients (n = 5, 16%) with uncertain GHD and an IGF-I concentration ≥ -2 SD but a growth rate < -1 SD, would not have been identified as requiring GH secretion evaluation according to the decision rule (Figure 1). This potential false-negative rate shows the need for follow-up of the growth of these patients not identified as requiring GH secretion evaluation.

There were two potential sources of bias in our study. First, patients came from a specialist pediatric endocrinology outpatient department and were very probably at higher risk of GHD than any other population. This bias is demonstrated by the very high prevalence (22%) of patients with GHD compared with other series. We also excluded children with priming with testosterone or estradiol to avoid a confounding bias with IGF-I because we were treating it as a potential predictive variable, and priming increases both IGF-I and peak GH concentrations. Second, there may have been classification errors for the predicted variable. Although stimulation tests must be used to evaluate short children for whom GHD is considered, their reproducibility is poor. The response varies substantially according to the stimulus used. Moreover, test response also includes a component of intraindividual variability. In a study of 40 Israeli children, Zadik and colleagues reported a moderate correlation (r = 0.52) between two tests conducted 6 weeks apart with the same pharmacological agent. In our study, as in all studies that have used stimulation tests as the reference test, classification errors may intervene.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^1164YzyB]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for adult growth hormone deficiency, particularly with respect to GH in sports, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend acknowledging the difficulty in detecting recombinant human GH abuse, as GH is a naturally occurring substance with a short half-life after subcutaneous and intravenous injection. It is released in a pulsatile fashion, and levels increase after exercise. Do not obtain drug testing with urine sampling, as it is neither accurate nor reliable. Moreover, repeated blood sampling over 24 hours is neither practical nor feasible in the sports setting.

In the context of medical management for adult growth hormone deficiency, particularly concerning GH therapy and monitoring, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend that the following parameters be assessed at approximately 6–12-month intervals once maintenance recombinant human GH doses are achieved:

- **Serum IGF-1**: Monitor to assess the effectiveness of GH therapy.

- **Fasting glucose and HbA1c**: Evaluate to manage potential glucose metabolism alterations.

- **Fasting lipids**: Check to identify any dyslipidemias requiring intervention.

- **BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio**: Measure to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.

- **Serum free T4**: Assess thyroid function as it may be impacted by GH therapy.

- **Early morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation test**: Conduct if clinically indicated to assess adrenal function.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^113Pvjk3]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

As far as we know, the DCG is the only published guideline on the general diagnostic work-up for short stature in secondary health care. Despite the fact that this consensus was well known in both hospitals participating in this study, a complete detailed routine diagnostic work-up as proposed in the DCG was not performed in any of the children. In 43% of the patients in the university hospital and 32% in the general hospital, no routine laboratory examination was done at all.

The heterogeneity of tests used in the diagnostic work-up, resulting in many missing data for the individual tests in this study, unfortunately does not allow us to construct an evidence-based decision rule for the general diagnostic work-up in children with short stature. We know, however, from a previous study that testing for celiac disease should be part of this work-up, especially when there is no specific indication of another cause for short stature. Likewise, the diagnosis of Turner syndrome should be considered in any girl with unexplained short stature.

In contrast, the prior probability of CF in infants or children with a low weight or length for age is very low, and therefore a sweat test is not necessary in all children with short stature. Whether an acid-base equilibrium is necessary in every child with short stature to rule out renal acidosis will be addressed in a later study. In the meantime, the available evidence so far can be used to construct a new guideline with an expected acceptable efficacy and efficiency.

### Growth monitoring and diagnostic work-up of short stature: An international inventorization [^113R9WtY]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Growth monitoring is almost universally performed, but few data are available on which referral criteria and diagnostic work-up are used worldwide for children with short stature.

- **Methods**: A short questionnaire, containing questions on auxological screening and on diagnostic criteria for short stature, was sent to all members of the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and to several pediatric endocrinologists outside Europe.

- **Results**: Responses were received from 36 countries. In 27 (75%), a child health care program existed and in 14 (39%) there was a protocol for referral of children with growth retardation. Height for age was mostly used as a referral criterion. Sixteen countries (45%) reported having a guideline in secondary health care for diagnostic work-up. Although all countries agreed on having biochemical, radiological, and/or genetic tests in the diagnostic work-up, there was a wide variety of recommended tests.

- **Conclusions**: There is little consensus on referral criteria and diagnostic work-up of children with short stature among industrialized countries. There is a need to establish evidence-based guidelines.

### Approach to the patient: Case studies in pediatric growth hormone deficiency and their management [^115Quh9T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Pathologies attributed to perturbations of the GH/IGF-I axis are among the most common referrals received by pediatric endocrinologists.

- **Aim**: In this article, distinctive case-based presentations are used to provide a practical and pragmatic approach to the management of pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD).

- **Cases**: We present four case vignettes based on actual patients that illustrate (1) congenital GHD, (2) childhood GHD presenting as failure to thrive, (3) childhood GHD presenting in adolescence as growth deceleration, and (4) childhood-onset GHD manifesting as metabolic complications in adolescence. We review patient presentation and a management approach that aims to highlight diagnostic considerations for treatment based on clinical guidelines, with mention of new therapeutic and diagnostic modalities being used in the field.

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric GHD is diverse in etiology and clinical presentation. Timely management has the potential not only to improve growth but can also ameliorate or even mitigate adverse metabolic outcomes, which can be directly attributed to a GH deficient state.

### Development and validation of a mobile application for point of care evaluation of growth failure [^117BnrR6]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Lack of systematic evaluation of short stature results in unnecessary work-up on one hand while missing pathology on the other. We have developed a mobile application that guides the work-up based on age, auxology (height, BMI, and corrected standard deviation score), and skeletal maturation with the aim of reducing diagnostic errors. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a mobile application for point of care evaluation of short stature.

- **Methods**: The application was developed (n = 400) and validated (n = 412) on children and adolescents (2–18 years of age) presenting to our Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic with short stature. Height standard deviation score thresholds determining the need for work-up were derived from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Student's t-test and ROC curves were used to identify the most appropriate parameter differentiating constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) from pathological and nutritional from endocrine causes. The validation of the application involved comparing the application-predicted diagnosis and the clinical diagnosis at each step of the algorithm.

- **Results**: The mobile application diagnosis was concordant with clinical diagnosis in 408 (99.0%) with discordance in four cases (two with CDGP labeled as growth hormone deficiency [GHD] and two with GHD labeled as CDGP).

- **Conclusions**: Mobile application guided short stature assessment has a high concordance with the clinical diagnosis and is expected to help point of care short stature evaluation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult growth hormone deficiency, particularly concerning provocative testing, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend not obtaining random serum GH and IGF-1 levels alone for the diagnosis of AGHD. Instead, GH stimulation tests should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis, except in specific subpopulations such as:

- **Organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease**: Patients with conditions such as a suprasellar mass with previous surgery and cranial irradiation who have multiple (≥ 3) pituitary hormone deficiencies and low serum IGF-1 levels (< -2.0 SDS).

- **Genetic defects**: Individuals with genetic defects affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axes.

- **Structural brain defects**: Patients with hypothalamic-pituitary structural brain defects.

### Management of the child born small for gestational age through to adulthood: A consensus statement of the International Societies of Pediatric Endocrinology and the Growth Hormone Research Society [^117Q3HcH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Low birth weight remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in early infancy and childhood and is associated with an increased risk of health problems later in life, particularly coronary heart disease and stroke. A meeting was convened to identify the key health issues facing a child born small for gestational age (SGA) and to propose management strategies.

- **Participants**: There were 42 participants chosen for their expertise in obstetrics, peri- and neonatal medicine, pediatrics, pediatric and adult endocrinology, epidemiology, and pharmacology.

- **Evidence**: Written materials were exchanged, reviewed, revised, and then made available to all. This formed the basis for discussions at the meeting. Where published data were not available or adequate, discussion was based on expert clinical opinions.

- **Consensus process**: Each set of questions was considered by all and then discussed in plenary sessions with consensus and unresolved issues identified. The consensus statement was prepared in plenary sessions and then edited by the group chairs and shared with all participants.

- **Conclusions**: The diagnosis of SGA should be based on accurate anthropometry at birth, including weight, length, and head circumference. We recommend early surveillance in a growth clinic for those without catch-up. Early neurodevelopment evaluation and interventions are warranted in at-risk children. Endocrine and metabolic disturbances in the SGA child are recognized but infrequent. For the 10% who lack catch-up, GH treatment can increase linear growth.

More specifically with respect to laboratory quality control, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend considering the differences in serum IGF-1 assay performance when evaluating and monitoring recombinant human GH therapy in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Wherever feasible, the same IGF-1 assay should be used for a given patient throughout the evaluation for diagnosis and follow-up.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116jnaEx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The objective is to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).

- **Participants**: The chair of the Task Force was selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society (TES). The chair selected five other endocrinologists and a medical writer, who were approved by the Council. One closed meeting of the group was held. There was no corporate funding, and members of the group received no remuneration.

- **Evidence**: Only fully published, peer-reviewed literature was reviewed. The grades of evidence used are outlined in the Appendix.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved through one group meeting and e-mailing of drafts that were written by the group with grammatical/style help from the medical writer. Drafts were reviewed successively by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, the Clinical Affairs Committee, and TES Council, and a version was placed on the TES website for comments. At each level, the writing group incorporated needed changes.

- **Conclusions**: GHD can persist from childhood or be newly acquired. Confirmation through stimulation testing is usually required unless there is a proven genetic/structural lesion persistent from childhood. Growth hormone therapy offers benefits in body composition, exercise capacity, skeletal integrity, and quality of life measures and is most likely to benefit those patients who have more severe GHD. The risks of growth hormone treatment are low. Growth hormone dosing regimens should be individualized. The final decision to treat adults with GHD requires thoughtful clinical judgment.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^113KtVzR]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to provocative testing, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend using BMI-appropriate GH cut-points for the glucagon stimulation test to reduce the possibility of misclassifying GH-sufficient patients. This is because increased BMI is associated with a decreased glucagon-induced GH stimulatory effect. Use a GH cut-point of 3 mcg/L in patients with normal weight (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m²) and overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m²) with a low pretest probability. There is insufficient evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the glucagon stimulation test in patients with glucose intolerance.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^1122txk5]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

The development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines protocols.

The Executive Summary of this 2019 updated guideline contains 58 numbered recommendations: 12 are Grade A (21%), 19 are Grade B (33%), 21 are Grade C (36%), and 6 are Grade D (10%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations.

This update contains 357 citations, of which 51 (14%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (strong), 168 (47%) are EL 2 (intermediate), 61 (17%) are EL 3 (weak), and 77 (22%) are EL 4 (no clinical evidence). This CPG serves as a practical tool for practicing endocrinologists and regulatory bodies regarding the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult-care services with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). It provides guidelines on assessment, screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment recommendations for a range of individuals.

### Growth hormone levels in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in adulthood [^114Mx52V]. Pituitary (2007). High credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) state that the diagnosis must be proven biochemically by provocative testing conducted within the appropriate clinical context. The reliance on provocative testing is based on evidence showing that evaluating spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion over 24 hours and measuring IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels do not distinguish between normal and GHD subjects.

- **Definitive evidence for severe GHD**: It has been demonstrated that very low IGF-I levels in patients highly suspected of GHD (i.e. patients with childhood-onset, severe GHD, or with multiple hypopituitarism acquired in adulthood) may be considered definitive evidence for severe GHD, thus obviating the need for provocative tests. However, normal IGF-I levels do not rule out severe GHD. Therefore, adults suspected of GHD and having normal IGF-I levels must undergo a provocative test of GH secretion.

- **Test of choice**: The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is the test of choice, with severe GHD being defined by a GH peak of less than 3 microg/l, a cut-off that distinguishes normal from GHD adults.

- **Contraindications for ITT**: The ITT is contraindicated in the presence of ischemic heart disease, seizure disorders, and in the elderly.

- **Alternative tests**: Other tests are as reliable as the ITT, provided they are used with appropriate cut-off limits. Glucagon stimulation, a classical test, and especially new maximal tests such as GHRH in combination with arginine or GHS (i.e. GHRP-6) have well-defined cut-off limits, are reproducible, are independent of age and gender, and are able to distinguish between normal and GHD subjects.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11321bzG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult growth hormone deficiency, specifically in reference to provocative testing, ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering a low IGF-1 level at least one month off GH therapy as sufficient documentation of persistent GHD. This applies without additional provocative testing in patients with childhood-onset GHD who have structural lesions resulting in multiple hormone deficiencies, as well as in patients with proven genetic causes.

### Selecting short-statured children needing growth hormone testing: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule [^114rBG8i]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The suboptimal nature of a systematic strategy of stimulation tests and the intrinsic limitations of these tests make the construction of a predictive tool for GHD necessary. The tool we propose is very effective for certain GHD, but far less so for uncertain GHD. The debate about the abnormal character of uncertain GHD highlights the interest in our tool. Nonetheless, in view of the limitations of our study, and especially the low number of patients with certain GHD, these results should be validated at other centers, as other decision rules in pediatric endocrinology have been, before any widespread clinical application.

### The diagnostic work up of growth failure in secondary health care; an evaluation of consensus guidelines [^114hYbtu]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Short stature or a poor growth rate can be the first manifestation of undetected diseases in children. Poor growth can be caused by a great diversity of congenital or acquired conditions, such as Turner syndrome, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), or celiac disease, for all of which early diagnosis and treatment are important. When treated at an early stage, the effect on adult height is optimal, and the quality of life will presumably improve. The possibility for proper treatment depends both on the early identification of these children in the community and on the accurate diagnostic work-up in the hospital afterwards.

For the early identification of children with abnormal growth, it is important to have accurate and well-defined referral criteria in combination with a good growth monitoring system. In a previous study, we performed an inquiry about advised referral criteria among pediatric endocrinologists in Europe as well as in most industrialized countries around the world. We concluded that there was little consensus. Moreover, the literature provides only a few guidelines for the analysis of short stature, and these are based on consensus meetings rather than on experimental evidence. In experimental studies on growth monitoring, various arbitrary referral criteria were used.

There is not only scarce evidence on referral criteria but also on the diagnostic work-up in secondary health care for children with poor growth. Although there are a number of consensus guidelines on the diagnosis of GHD and some articles on the analysis of short stature in general, comprehensive experimental evidence is limited.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116yfTXL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The aim was to update The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on the evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) previously published in 2006.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions through a series of conference calls and emails. An initial draft was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society. A second draft was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated substantive changes.

- **Conclusions**: GHD can persist from childhood or be newly acquired. Confirmation through stimulation testing is usually required unless there is a proven genetic or structural lesion persistent from childhood. GH therapy offers benefits in body composition, exercise capacity, skeletal integrity, and quality of life measures and is most likely to benefit those patients who have more severe GHD. The risks associated with GH treatment are low. GH dosing regimens should be individualized. The final decision to treat adults with GHD requires thoughtful clinical judgment with a careful evaluation of the benefits and risks specific to the individual.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for management of growth hormone deficiency in adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care [^112ei1Dk]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to the transition to adult care, the AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining close monitoring during the transition of adult patients with childhood-onset GHD caused by structural pituitary or brain tumors. These patients tend to have lower bone mineral density, impaired bone microarchitecture, and more adverse body composition abnormalities and cardiovascular risk markers than patients with adult-onset GHD.
