Treatment Effect of the SGLT2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin on Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis: Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluating empagliflozin for chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia, including study design, results, safety, limitations, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why SIAD is hard to treat. Then, I should verify the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibition might help. Next, I will review the trial design and endpoints. After that, I need to check the primary and secondary results with exact figures. Then, I should appraise safety and tolerability. I will now examine limitations and evidence quality. Finally, I will consider how this fits with prior data and outline practical clinical implications and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Chronic SIAD causes inappropriate AVP-driven water retention and hypotonic hyponatremia, and fluid restriction is only effective in about half of patients, leaving a persistent need for safe, effective second-line options that avoid rapid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination risk [^228b498d] [^04c0e469].

> I need to verify the mechanistic rationale. Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, increasing glycosuria and thereby producing osmotic diuresis with electrolyte-free water clearance, which should theoretically raise serum sodium without provoking neurohormonal activation seen with loop diuretics; mechanistic and clinical studies show increased urine volume and modest natriuresis without excess kaliuresis or neurohormonal stimulation, supporting this approach in SIAD [^980ca291] [^da2b7ac1] [^5dcccbef].

> Next, I should review the trial design. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 14 outpatients with chronic SIAD and hyponatremia, comparing 4 weeks of empagliflozin 25 mg daily versus placebo with a washout, and using serum sodium as the primary endpoint; neurocognitive testing with MoCA was an exploratory outcome, which is important given the cognitive burden of chronic hyponatremia [^81139bb0] [^de93189b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the baseline characteristics. Median age was 72 years, 50% female, median baseline sodium 131 mmol/L, and etiologies included drug-induced, pulmonary, CNS, stress, and idiopathic causes; importantly, patients were not on fluid restriction during the trial, which isolates the effect of empagliflozin itself [^81139bb0] [^de93189b].

> I will now examine the primary outcome. After 4 weeks, median sodium rose to 134 mmol/L on empagliflozin versus 130 mmol/L on placebo, yielding a between-treatment difference of 4.1 mmol/L with 95% CI 1.7 to 6.5 and P = 0.004; this magnitude is clinically meaningful for chronic SIAD and aligns with the expected osmotic mechanism [^81139bb0] [^de93189b].

> Let me consider the exploratory cognitive outcome. MoCA scores improved by a median of 1.16 points on empagliflozin versus placebo, with 95% CI 0.05 to 2.26; while small, this is directionally consistent with observational and interventional data linking hyponatremia correction to improved neurocognition, though causality cannot be firmly inferred from this small study [^81139bb0] [^2ee95838].

> I should double-check safety. No serious adverse events occurred, and there were no episodes of sodium overcorrection, hypoglycemia, hypotension, or urinary/genital infections; reported symptoms were mild and included thirst, headache, and vertigo, with nausea only on placebo, suggesting good short-term tolerability in this population [^81139bb0] [^de93189b].

> But wait, what about limitations. The sample size is very small, the study is single-center, and the duration is only 4 weeks; thus, generalizability, durability, and rare safety signals remain uncertain, and larger multicenter trials are needed to confirm efficacy and define safety in diverse SIAD etiologies and comorbidities, including those with impaired renal function [^81139bb0] [^de93189b].

> Next, I should review how this fits with prior evidence. An earlier inpatient RCT showed that empagliflozin added to fluid restriction accelerated sodium correction over 4 days, reinforcing biologic plausibility; however, that study's control arm also improved with fluid restriction alone, underscoring the need for head-to-head and chronic-phase data without confounding by fluid restriction [^ea02c860] [^16b383cd].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are framed carefully. Empagliflozin 25 mg daily appears to be a promising, mechanistically rational option for chronic SIAD when fluid restriction fails or is not tolerated, with a favorable safety profile in this short-term trial; however, it is not yet standard of care, and clinicians should monitor for volume depletion, especially in older adults or those on diuretics, and avoid use in advanced CKD where efficacy wanes and adverse effects may rise [^81139bb0] [^49938d56] [^727b3dc4].

> Let me reconsider the path forward. Definitive adoption awaits larger randomized trials, ideally comparing empagliflozin with established second-line therapies like oral urea and tolvaptan, and evaluating hard outcomes such as falls, fractures, and quality of life; ongoing studies in broader hyponatremia populations should clarify dosing, durability, and safety, including in CKD and cirrhosis where SIAD is common [^79958f0b] [^523ae636].

Empagliflozin 25 mg daily for 4 weeks **increased serum sodium by a median of 4.1 mmol/L** (95% CI 1.7–6.5; P = 0.004) versus placebo in chronic SIAD, with a **median sodium rise from 131 to 134 mmol/L** and no overcorrection events [^81139bb0]. MoCA scores improved by 1.16 points (95% CI 0.05–2.26), suggesting modest cognitive benefit, and the drug was well tolerated without serious adverse events [^81139bb0]. These results support empagliflozin as a promising, safe option for chronic SIAD, though larger trials are needed to confirm durability and clinical outcomes [^de93189b].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.
- **Participants**: 14 outpatients with chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia; median age 72 years, 50% female.
- **Intervention**: 4 weeks of empagliflozin 25 mg daily vs placebo, with crossover and washout.
- **Primary endpoint**: Difference in serum sodium between treatments.
- **Secondary endpoints**: Neurocognitive function (MoCA), safety, and tolerability [^81139bb0].

---

## Key findings

### Primary endpoint

Median serum sodium increased from 131 mmol/L (IQR 130–132) at baseline to 134 mmol/L (IQR 132–136) after empagliflozin, whereas placebo showed no change (130 mmol/L; IQR 128–132), yielding a **between-treatment difference of 4.1 mmol/L** (95% CI 1.7–6.5; P = 0.004) [^81139bb0].

---

### Secondary endpoints

Neurocognitive function improved by a median of 1.16 points on MoCA (95% CI 0.05–2.26) with empagliflozin versus placebo, indicating modest cognitive benefit [^81139bb0]. Safety and tolerability were favorable: no serious adverse events, no sodium overcorrection, and no hypoglycemia, hypotension, or urinary/genital infections were reported [^81139bb0].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Efficacy**: Empagliflozin meaningfully increases serum sodium in chronic SIAD, offering a novel, mechanism-based therapy.
- **Safety**: The absence of overcorrection and serious adverse events supports short-term safety in this population.
- **Cognitive benefit**: The observed MoCA improvement suggests potential reversal of hyponatremia-related neurocognitive impairment, though larger studies are needed [^2ee95838].
- **Practical advantage**: Oral administration and favorable safety profile may improve adherence compared with fluid restriction or urea.

---

## Limitations and future directions

- **Small sample**: Only 14 patients; larger RCTs are needed to confirm efficacy and safety.
- **Short duration**: 4-week treatment; longer trials should assess durability and clinical outcomes.
- **Generalizability**: Limited to chronic SIAD; effects in acute or severe hyponatremia are unknown.
- **Mechanistic questions**: The relative contributions of osmotic diuresis versus natriuresis remain to be clarified [^5dcccbef].

---

Empagliflozin 25 mg daily for 4 weeks **significantly increased serum sodium** by 4.1 mmol/L versus placebo in chronic SIAD, with modest cognitive improvement and good tolerability, supporting its promise as a new therapy; larger, longer trials are warranted to define its role in clinical practice [^81139bb0].

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is characterized by a reduction of free water excretion with consecutive hypotonic hyponatremia and is therefore challenging to treat. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion, likely leading to increased electrolyte free water clearance.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we compared 4-week treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg/d to placebo in outpatients with chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia. At baseline and after both treatment cycles, patients underwent different assessments including neurocognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]). The primary end point was the difference in serum sodium levels between treatments.

Results

Fourteen patients, 50% female, with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-77), completed the trial. Median serum sodium level at baseline was 131 mmol/L (IQR, 130-132). After treatment with empagliflozin, median serum sodium level rose to 134 mmol/L (IQR, 132-136), whereas no increase was seen with placebo (130 mmol/L; IQR, 128-132), corresponding to a serum sodium increase of 4.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 6.5; P =0.004). Exploratory analyses showed that treatment with empagliflozin led to improved neurocognitive function with an increase of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.05 to 2.26) in the MoCA score. Treatment was well tolerated; no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia, possibly improving neurocognitive function. Larger studies are needed to confirm the observed treatment effects.

A second, randomized controlled crossover study in 14 patients (50% female, median age 72 years, 2 with type 2 diabetes) compared a 4-week treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg/d to placebo in outpatients with chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia, without concomitant FR. The etiology of chronic SIADs ranged from drug-induced (antiepileptic [n = 3] and antidepressants [n = 1], which could not be stopped), to pulmonary (n = 3) or CNS disorders (n = 2) to stress induced due to chronic pain (n = 1). In 4 patients, the etiology remained idiopathic. Median baseline pNa was 131 mmol/L and increased following treatment with empagliflozin to 134 mmol/L, whereas no increase was seen with placebo (130 mmol/L). This resulted in a serum sodium increase of 4.1 mmol/L (P =.004) on empagliflozin as compared to placebo. Treatment with empagliflozin was generally well tolerated. Increased thirst was reported in about half of all patients under both treatments, and a few patients reported headache and vertigo; nausea was reported only on placebo. No events of sodium overcorrection, hypoglycemia, hypotension, or urinary tract or genital infection occurred during the observation period. Of the 7 reported adverse events, 5 were potentially related to empagliflozin treatment. On placebo, 2 of the reported 7 adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the study intervention.

Experience with SGLT2 therapy for other indications has shown a risk of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients who are unwell in the hospital, potentially limiting the indication for this therapy in multimorbid hospital inpatients—though no episodes of ketoacidosis occurred in the trial. A larger trial in chronic euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia is currently underway (NCT04447911). The accessibility, clinical familiarity, and relative safety of SGLT2is may see them become a widely used therapy in SIAD—if efficacy is established.

Randomized controlled trials in management of chronic hypotonic hyponatremia

Current guideline-directed management of hyponatremia is largely based on expert opinion and is expected to evolve with new evidence over the coming years. Trials are currently in progress comparing protocolized low-dose tolvaptan vs FR in SIAD, and evaluating empagliflozin in inpatients and outpatients with euvolemic and hypervolemic chronic hyponatremia (NCT04447911). Despite controversies in approach, there is retrospective evidence that active management of inpatients with hyponatremia by specialist physicians (endocrinologists or nephrologists, depending on local practice) may improve mortality and reduce length of hospital stay. This was reported in an audit of a single Irish center over a 5-year period from 2005 to 2010, that found increasing rates of specialist referral (32%-68%) and use of active hyponatremia management strategies for pNa less than 120 mmol/L (63%-88%) was associated with a 91% reduction in mortality risk (P <.001). A UK single-center study compared 18 individuals with hyponatremia less than 127 mmol/L (mean pNa 120.7 mmol/L) who received prompt endocrine specialist input with 23 historical controls (mean Na 124.1 mmol/L), observing faster time to achieving a sodium increase of 5 mmol/L or greater (3.5 days vs 7.1 days; P =.005), and reduced length of stay in the intervention group (10.9 vs 14.5 days; P =.004). A large Swiss multicenter international RCT, currently recruiting, has been designed to definitively evaluate the hypothesis that correction of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients reduces the risk of death or rehospitalization (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03557957).

It is worth noting that chronic mild-moderate hyponatremia due to a reset osmostat may not be amenable to correction when compared to other causes of SIAD—as due to increased thirst above the new osmotic set point, FR, and other therapies are unlikely to be effective.

Potential treatments for hyponatremia in SIAD are discussed and evaluated next, and a proposed management algorithm based on best available current evidence is summarized in Fig. 10.

### Empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (...) [^ce3e5511]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection. SGLT2 inhibitors prevent the absorption of sodium and glucose in the proximal renal tubule, resulting in natriuresis, glucosuria, and increased urine output. 2 In addition, several other mechanisms likely mediate the benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors, including increased autophagy, reduced inflammation, improvement. of energy metabolism, and prevention of adverse cardiac remodeling. 3, 4 It has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors primarily act through a diuretic mechanism and that their benefit may be attenuated in patients already taking other diuretics.

5 It is also possible that combined use of SGLT2 inhibitors with conventional diuretics may increase the risk of volume depletion events, acute kidney injury, and other adverse effects. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors may also impact the need for conventional diuretic therapy. Outcomes were studied in the placebo group alone to characterize the natural history of patients by baseline diuretic dose. For this analysis, the group receiving no diuretics at baseline was treated as a reference against which outcomes in other subgroups were compared. Next, the treatment effect of empagliflozin by baseline diuretic therapy was assessed for each outcome. Findings were similar after stratification by diuretic dose, with higher diuretic doses associated with a stepwise increase in the risk of all aforementioned clinical outcomes.

In the placebo arm, neither baseline diuretic use status nor dose was associated with the risk of the composite kidney end point or eGFR slope. SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule and thus promote both natriuretic and osmotic diuresis. However, the diuretic effects are short lived and, even if durable, it is not clear whether these effects contribute in any way to the heart failure benefits seen with these drugs. The finding that statistical significance was achieved in the EMPEROR-Preserved trial as early as 18 days following randomization is a function of the number of events noted at that time and does not imply any specific mechanism. 15.

### A randomized trial of empagliflozin to increase plasma sodium levels in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^ea02c860]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment options to address the hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) are inadequate. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion and therefore, might offer a novel treatment option for SIAD.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized trial, we recruited 88 hospitalized patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia <130 mmol/L at the University Hospital Basel from September 2016 until January 2019 and assigned patients to receive, in addition to standard fluid restriction of <1000 ml/24 h, a once-daily dose of oral empagliflozin or placebo for 4 days. The primary end point was the absolute change in plasma sodium concentration after 4 days of treatment. Secondary end points included predisposing factors for treatment response and safety of the intervention.

Results

Of the 87 patients who completed the trial, 43 (49%) received treatment with empagliflozin, and 44 (51%) received placebo. Baseline plasma sodium concentrations were similar for the two groups (median 125.5 mmol/L for the empaflozin group and median 126 mmol/L for the placebo group). Patients treated with empagliflozin had a significantly higher increase of median plasma sodium concentration compared with those receiving placebo (10 versus 7 mmol/L, respectively; P =0.04). Profound hyponatremia (<125 mmol/L) and lower baseline osmolality levels increased the likelihood of response to treatment with empagliflozin. Treatment was well tolerated, and no events of hypoglycemia or hypotension occurred among those receiving empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients with SIAD treated with fluid restriction, those who received empagliflozin had a larger increase in plasma sodium levels compared with those who received placebo. This finding indicates that empagliflozin warrants further study as a treatment for the disorder.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for “autocorrection” of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors

SGLT2is, approved for treatment of diabetes and heart failure, may be beneficial in SIAD. The SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubule is responsible for 90% of renal glucose resorption and 65% of sodium resorption. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glycosuria, accompanied by an osmotic diuresis (see Fig. 11). Due to the increased free water excretion, SGLT2is have been investigated in SIAD as a novel therapy. A randomized trial of 87 inpatients with SIAD compared 4 days of empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo, in addition to 1000-mL FR, in patients with a mean baseline pNa of 125.5 mmol/L. pNa increased by 10 mmol/L over 4 days in the empagliflozin plus FR group, compared to 7 mmol/L with placebo and FR (P =.04). Comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 14% of participants, equal between empagliflozin and placebo arms. pNa overcorrection occurred in 2 patients in the empagliflozin arm (5%), compared to 1 in the placebo arm. The only other potentially related adverse event was decreased renal function in 7% empagliflozin participants that later resolved. There was no hypotension or hypoglycemia observed. The relatively high sodium increment in the placebo group (ie, FR alone) suggests that at least in some patients, reversible stimuli to AVP secretion may have been present. It is worth noting that the causes of SIAD were unbalanced between the 2 groups; therefore, the rates of autocorrection may have differed. However, the higher rate of malignancy (a nonreversible stimulus) in the SGLT2i group would if anything excepted to bias the response rate in favor of the placebo group. No biomarkers, including copeptin, were predictive of response to empagliflozin.

Potential explanations for cognitive impairment may include cerebral depletion of organic osmolytes, including the neurotransmitter glutamate, or slower neuronal processing. There is also evidence that hyponatremia may negatively affect mood, with one study finding Beck Depression Inventory scores indicative of depression in 50% patients with profound hyponatremia. In the SALT trials of tolvaptan therapy, mental health scores improved in tolvaptan-treated patients with baseline pNa below 130 mmol/L compared to the placebo group, in line with serum sodium correction. As low mood is known to affect cognitive performance, this may be an additional potential mechanism.

Only 2 randomized trials have sought to assess whether correction of hyponatremia can have positive cognitive outcomes. The INSIGHT trial was a pilot study that assessed a composite score of reaction time, psychomotor speed, and processing speed in 57 participants with chronic hyponatremia before and after a 3-week intervention with tolvaptan or placebo. Baseline cognitive performance was impaired compared to age-matched normative values, across the whole study population (mean pNa 129 mmol/L). In the tolvaptan-treated group, who had a significant improvement in plasma sodium levels compared to placebo (P <.001), there was no significant difference in the primary composite cognitive outcome relative to the placebo group (P =.08), who remained hyponatremic. One individual cognitive measure of the 3 components of the composite score reached statistical significance, which was faster psychomotor speed in the tolvaptan group (P =.03). This was deemed clinically significant for those with initial sodium less than 130 mmol/L (treatment effect 0.27; 95% CI,.04-.51)—representing a subgroup of only 12 tolvaptan-treated patients, and was not corrected for multiple comparisons. Most participants in this small study had mild-moderate hyponatremia, and it may have been underpowered, but failure to achieve a statistically significant change in the primary outcome implies that raising plasma sodium with tolvaptan may not improve cognitive outcomes. More recently, a crossover randomized trial of a 4-week intervention with the SGLT2i empagliflozin and placebo in 14 patients showed a statistically significant increase both in pNa and cognitive function as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in the empagliflozin group. However, whether this beneficial effect was caused by the increase of sodium or related to empagliflozin treatment remains unclear.

The mechanism for increased falls in hyponatremia may be due to impairments in gait, attention, and nerve conduction from low sodium concentrations. A direct assessment of gait was performed in a substudy of 12 outpatients with chronic hyponatremia (mean pNa 128 mmol/L) who completed a task quantifying unsteadiness over 3 tandem steps in comparison to matched normonatremic controls. Hyponatremic patients had impairment that was equivalent to that seen after moderate alcohol intake in controls (0.55 g of alcohol per kg body weight [∼ 3-5 standard drinks]; mean blood alcohol concentration 0.06 g/100 mL—just above the legal driving limit in many European countries). Importantly, gait steadiness improved after normalization of serum sodium, which may suggest that the risk of falls associated with hyponatremia may be modifiable with normalization of serum sodium. A follow-up study noted greater effects of hyponatremia on attention and balance in older compared to younger adults. Another small, mechanistic, uncontrolled study assessed muscle strength, nerve conduction and mobility (Timed Up-and-Go Test) in 11 patients before and after correction of hyponatremia (mean pNa 122-136 nmol/L). There was no change in muscle strength, but a significant improvement in velocity of neural signal on peripheral nerve conduction studies, and faster completion of Timed Up-and-Go Test on normalization of serum sodium. Impaired peripheral nerve conduction may be an important contributor to falls in hyponatremia. However, in a small, randomized controlled study using empagliflozin to increase sodium levels no effect on gait was seen, so this is not a consistently observed benefit. Hence, further study into the relationship between falls and hyponatremia is needed.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^9e159a5e]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A new body of evidence for a negative effect of hyponatremia on bone may emerge from assessment of serum bone turnover markers such a C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), considered to be a marker of bone resorption, and N-propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), a marker of bone formation. A small, longitudinal pilot study prospectively measured serial bone turnover markers over 1 week in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Eight patients developed mild-moderate hyponatremia (mean pNa 131 mmol/L), and 14 maintained normal serum sodium and acted as controls. The authors observed a reduction in P1NP in patients who became hyponatremic (P =.02), indicating reduced bone formation activity. CTX levels rose in both groups over time (P =.001) potentially due to reduced mobility, but there was no between group difference, indicating no effect of hyponatremia on a surrogate measure of bone resorption in this very small data set. Another study assessed bone turnover markers by way of a prespecified post hoc analysis of a larger short-term trial of empagliflozin in hyponatremia and found that P1NP levels rose in those patients in whom hyponatremia corrected after 5 days, which would imply that resolution of hyponatremia might have a positive effect on osteoblast function. CTX rose over the 5 days in the whole cohort of hyponatremic patients whether it was corrected or not. P1NP did not change in those who remained hyponatremic. Caution needs to be exercised in interpretating studies reporting changes in bone turnover biomarkers. Markers of bone formation and markers of bone resorption are measuring coupled bone remodeling events, occurring in different basic multicellular units, and occurring on different time scales. Therefore, differential changes in biomarkers such as P1NP and CTX, especially if measured in the short term, have their limitations in inferring net gain or loss of bone mineral.

This assembled evidence does support a contribution of chronic hyponatremia to loss of bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, and while several mechanisms have been proposed, this process is not fully understood. It remains to be determined whether correction of hyponatremia reduces risk of fracture.

Essential Points

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting around 15% of hospitalized patients - while most are mild (≥ 130 mmol/L), 4% record plasma sodium concentration (pNa) below 130 mmol/L
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) due to excess arginine vasopressin (AVP) despite low serum tonicity, is the leading cause of nonmild hyponatremia
Severe symptomatic hyponatremia manifesting as vomiting, seizure, and reduced conscious state, is a medical emergency and urgent bolus hypertonic saline (100 mL of 3% NaCl, up to 3 doses) is indicated to achieve an initial pNa increase of 4 to 6 mmol/L, to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP)
To prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) in hyponatremia of chronic (or unknown) duration, target a pNa increase of 4 to 8 mmol/L/24 hours, and limit to 10 mmol/L/24 h (lower targets 4-6 mmol/L/24 hours for those with risk factors for ODS, eg, alcohol, malnutrition)
Fluid restriction (FR) of less than 1000 mL/day is the first-line therapy for chronic SIAD endorsed by current guidelines, but is effective in only around half of cases
Second-line therapies supported by current (limited) evidence include tolvaptan, urea, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) or high-dose salt tablets; of these, tolvaptan may be associated with the highest risk of overcorrection
If sodium correction limit is exceeded, relowering of pNa with hypotonic fluid (oral water or intravenous [IV] 5% dextrose), with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output, is indicated

Context

Hyponatremia is associated with increased risk for osteoporosis. Preclinical studies in untreated hyponatremia suggest osteoclast upregulation, whereas a clinical study showed improved osteoblast function after hyponatremia normalization in hospitalized patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Objective

This work aimed to investigate the effect of an increase in sodium on bone turnover, that is, the ratio of the osteoblast marker procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) to the osteoclast marker cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), in outpatients with chronic SIAD.

Methods

A predefined secondary analysis was conducted of the 2-month double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled SANDx Trial (NCT03202667) performed from December 2017 to August 2021. Participants included 11 outpatients with chronic SIAD: 6 women, median age 73 years, who received a 4-week treatment with 25-mg empagliflozin or placebo. Main outcome measures included the relationship between the change in bone formation index (BFI), defined as P1NP/CTX, and the change in plasma sodium levels.

Results

Changes in sodium were positively correlated with changes in BFI and P1NP (BFI: ρ=.55; P < .001; P1NP: ρ=.45; P = .004) but not with CTX (P = .184) and osteocalcin (P = .149). A sodium increase of 1 mmol/l was associated with an increase of 5.21 in BFI (95% CI, 1.41-9.00; P = .013) and with an increase of 1.48 µg/l in P1NP (95% CI, .26-2.62; P = .03). The effect of sodium change on bone markers was independent of the study medication empagliflozin.

Conclusion

An increase in plasma sodium levels in outpatients with chronic hyponatremia due to SIAD, even when mild, was associated with an increase in bone formation index (P1NP/CTX) triggered by an increase in P1NP, a surrogate marker of osteoblast function.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and serious liver events in patients with cirrhosis [^4f99314e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites often present with concurrent hyponatremia, with sodium levels significantly associated with the prognosis of decompensated liver disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors may mitigate hyponatremia through sodium-independent water excretion driven by osmotic diuresis. For patients with impaired free water excretion, such as those with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown particular benefit.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial demonstrated that treatment with empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, significantly increased serum sodium levels in patients with chronic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis-induced hyponatremia.Although SGLT-2 inhibitors induce natriuresis, compensatory mechanisms in the distal tubules prevent sustained natriuresis, leading to stable or gradually increasing serum sodium concentrations.

One recent study focused on studying the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on patients with diabetes with MASLD and hepatic fibrosis using the Fibrosis-4 index, revealing a significant reduction in hepatic fibrosis following 12 months of treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with a high baseline Fibrosis-4 index. This finding suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors may play a role in improving outcomes in this patient population.Although MASLD represents a distinct etiology, the observed reduction in hepatic fibrosis suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors may have beneficial effects on the liver that could extend to patients with cirrhosis. Proposed mechanisms include inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, all of which contribute to the progression of chronic liver disease.

### Effects of empagliflozin on renal sodium and glucose handling in patients with acute heart failure [^e6b6d0b3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients with diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease, sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors consistently showed beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and particularly on heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. 1, 2, 3, 4 Recently, one larger randomized clinical trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations in patients with established chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without diabetes. 5 A post‐hoc analysis showed that treatment with dapagliflozin was safe and effective regardless of diuretic use or dose. 6 The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on HF outcomes have been attributed to cardiometabolic and renal protective qualities, as well as to its diuretic properties. These were even described in chronic ‘stable’ euvolaemic HF. 6, 7, 8 In acute HF, we recently showed that early addition of empagliflozin to standard diuretic treatment increased cumulative diuresis after 4 days with a possible reduction in HF‐related events. 9 However, the mechanisms behind increased diuresis of SGLT2 inhibitors in acute HF are unknown. 10, 11 In the present mechanistic study, we investigated the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on renal function, and urinary sodium, chloride and glucose excretion in acute HF patients randomized to either empagliflozin or placebo.

### Empagliflozin in heart failure: diuretic and cardiorenal effects [^da2b7ac1]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve heart failure-related outcomes. The mechanisms underlying these benefits are not well understood, but diuretic properties may contribute. Traditional diuretics such as furosemide induce substantial neurohormonal activation, contributing to the limited improvement in intravascular volume often seen with these agents. However, the proximal tubular site of action of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may help circumvent these limitations.

Methods

Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic, stable heart failure completed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus placebo. Patients underwent an intensive 6-hour biospecimen collection and cardiorenal phenotyping at baseline and again after 14 days of study drug. After a 2-week washout, patients crossed over to the alternate therapy with the above protocol repeated.

Results

Oral empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed as evidenced by a 27-fold increase in urinary glucose excretion by 3 hours ( P <0.0001). Fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly with empagliflozin monotherapy versus placebo (fractional excretion of sodium, 1.2±0.7% versus 0.7±0.4%; P =0.001), and there was a synergistic effect in combination with bumetanide (fractional excretion of sodium, 5.8±2.5% versus 3.9±1.9%; P =0.001). At 14 days, the natriuretic effect of empagliflozin persisted, resulting in a reduction in blood volume (-208 mL [interquartile range, -536 to 153 mL] versus -14 mL [interquartile range, -282 to 335 mL]; P =0.035) and plasma volume (-138 mL, interquartile range, -379 to 154±453 mL; P =0.04). This natriuresis was not, however, associated with evidence of neurohormonal activation because the change in norepinephrine was superior ( P =0.02) and all other neurohormones were similar ( P <0.34) during the empagliflozin versus placebo period. Furthermore, there was no evidence of potassium wasting ( P =0.20) or renal dysfunction ( P >0.11 for all biomarkers), whereas both serum magnesium ( P <0.001) and uric acid levels ( P =0.008) improved.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin causes significant natriuresis, particularly when combined with loop diuretics, resulting in an improvement in blood volume. However, off-target electrolyte wasting, renal dysfunction, and neurohormonal activation were not observed. This favorable diuretic profile may offer significant advantage in the management of volume status in patients with heart failure and may represent a mechanism contributing to the superior long-term heart failure outcomes observed with these agents.

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^3ab84434]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Before the results of this substudy, attenuation of diuretic effects at low levels of kidney function was considered plausible as SGLT2 inhibitors have little effect on glycemia at lower eGFR due to attenuated levels of glycosuria.– Despite this, we found consistent effects on “Fluid Overload” across the eGFR-based subgroups. Similarly, effects did not vary by baseline fluid status, diuretic use, or albuminuria. These findings are analogous to results from large randomized trials in heart failure populations that included a large proportion of patients with CKD and low eGFR and demonstrated consistent effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure irrespective of sex, diabetes, eGFR, or NT-proBNP at baseline.

It is also relevant that the effect of empagliflozin on fluid loss in EMPA-KIDNEY was achieved safely. Although estimates of ECW reduction reflected loss of ECW that is not considered to be in excess by the three-compartment model, there was no increased risk of participant reports of symptomatic dehydration in the full trial or substudy cohorts nor any increased risk of AKI.

EFFECT OF SGLT2 INHIBITORS ON EDEMA AND CONGESTION

The primary end point for the regulatory approval of diuretics is the alleviation of edema in sodium-avid states. Thiazide and loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and vasopressin antagonists ameliorate fluid retention in heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. – In contrast, there are no reports of a favorable effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the edema of heart failure or the ascites of hepatic cirrhosis. Observations about decongestion are difficult to interpret when patients are being concurrently treated with an intensified regimen of loop diuretics.

It is interesting that in patients hospitalized for heart failure, there may be little relationship between the magnitude of natriuresis and the relief of symptoms. Intensive intravenous loop diuretics produce a greater diuresis but not greater effects on pulmonary congestion.The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to a loop diuretic yields a modest diuretic effect, but no incremental benefit on dyspnea.Acetazolamide potentiates the natriuretic response to loop diuretics but without a reported benefit on symptoms.Conventional diuretics may preferentially act to remove excess fluid from the interstitial space, with little change in total blood volume, cardiac filling pressures, or symptoms.

Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Congestion in Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure, treated for ≤90 days: EMPAG-HF (Empagliflozin in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure),EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF (Empagliflozin Response Acute Heart Failure),, and EMPULSE (Empagliflozin in Patients Hospitalized for Acute Heart Failure). The largest trial (EMPULSE [Empagliflozin in Patients Hospitalized for Acute Heart Failure]) enrolled 530 patients (NT-proBNP ≈3200 pg/mL) who (after in-hospital stabilization) were randomized to placebo or empagliflozin (10 mg/d) for 3 months. Empagliflozin reduced a composite symptom score, with benefits seen as early as 15 days, but with modest changes in NT-proBNP. Although patients were required to have pulmonary congestion or peripheral edema at randomization, the effects of empagliflozin on signs of fluid retention were not reported. Treatment with empagliflozin did not spare the use of loop diuretics; the number of patients receiving furosemide (>40 mg/d) was numerically more frequent in the empagliflozin group. Changes in body weight and hematocrit could not be ascribed to a diuresis, because they can be influenced by the rapid effects of empagliflozin to induce urinary caloric loss and erythropoiesis.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^1b279e70]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 2 years, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to improve HF‐related outcomes.These medications induce significant natriuresis and glucosuria, particularly when combined with loop diuretics (Figure 1), resulting in reduction in blood and plasma volume. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors have a proximal effect, leading to a shift of tubular fluid from the proximal to the distal segments of the nephron. This shift can increase natriuresis depending on the sodium‐retaining capacity of these distal segments (i.e. volume status, neurohumoral activation, use of diuretics). This natriuretic effect is not associated with any significant electrolyte wasting, renal dysfunction or neurohormonal activation.Importantly, the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is unaffected by concomitant treatment (or dosage) with a conventional diuretic.Most patients in the DAPA‐HF trial did not undergo a change in diuretic dose during follow‐up, and the mean daily dose of diuretics did not differ between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups.In line with these results, in a moderately‐sized trial study, Boorsma et al.reported that empagliflozin at a daily dose of 10 mg increased plasma osmolarity without affecting fractional sodium, chloride excretion, or urinary osmolality. However, two studies conversely reported favourable decongestion effects with higher doses of empagliflozin.Despite natriuresis being unchanged following empagliflozin initiation in the aforementioned studies, diuresis did increase in the study by Mordi et al.whereas fractional sodium excretion increased in the Griffin et al. study.Lastly, in keeping with the impact of neprilysin inhibition on pulmonary artery pressures, Nassif and colleagues similarly reported an average 12‐week treatment effect of −1.7 mmHg (p = 0.02) on mean pulmonary artery pressures among patients treated with empagliflozin versus placebo.Trials testing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diuretic resistance are ongoing (DAPA‐RESIST, NCT04860011). In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors were reported recently to be favourably associated with better overall clinical outcome in the setting of WHF in the EMPULSE trial.This positive result in acute HF, in which congestion is a key issue, parallels the results reported in the SOLOIST‐WHF trial, where the rate of the primary event in patients randomized to sotagliflozin was 30% lower than in the placebo group (HR 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.52–0.85; p < 0.001).The efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in acute HF will further be evaluated in the ongoing DICTATE‐AHF trial.Of note, SGLT2 inhibitors appear effective in patients with HFpEF: in the EMPEROR‐Preserved trial, an impressive 27% reduction in the total number of hospitalizations for HF was reported in the empagliflozin group.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: the RECEDE-CHF trial [^5dcccbef]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors improve heart failure-associated outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. In patients with heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors will likely be coprescribed with a loop diuretic, but this combined effect is not well-defined. Our aim was to assess the diuretic and natriuretic effect of empagliflozin in combination with loop diuretics.

Methods

The RECEDE-CHF trial (SGLT2 Inhibition in Combination With Diuretics in Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction taking regular loop diuretic who were randomized to empagliflozin 25 mg once daily or placebo for 6 weeks with a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in 24-hour urinary volume from baseline to week 6.

Results

Twenty-three participants (mean age, 69.8 years; 73.9% male; mean furosemide dose, 49.6±31.3 mg/d; mean HbA1c, 7.9±3.8%) were recruited. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urinary volume at both day 3 (mean difference, 535 mL [95% CI, 133-936]; P =0.005) and week 6 (mean difference, 545 mL [95% CI, 136-954]; P =0.005) after adjustment for treatment order, baseline 24-hour urine volume, and percentage change in loop diuretic dose. At 6 weeks, empagliflozin did not cause a significant change in 24-hour urinary sodium (mean difference, -7.85 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.43 to 6.73]; P =0.57). Empagliflozin caused a nonsignificant increase in fractional excretion of sodium at day 3, which was absent at week 6 (mean difference day 3, 0.30% [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.63]; P =0.09; week 6, 0.11% [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.44]; P >0.99), and a significant increase in electrolyte-free water clearance at week 6 (mean difference, 312 mL [95% CI, 26-598]; P =0.026) compared with placebo. Empagliflozin also caused significant reductions in body weight and serum urate at week 6.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin caused a significant increase in 24-hour urine volume without an increase in urinary sodium when used in combination with loop diuretic. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT03226457.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^22a97074]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

Methods

In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

Results

Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin according to background diuretic use in HFrEF: post-hoc analysis of EMPEROR-reduced [^e9b2b1a8]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The EMPEROR-Reduced (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial established the efficacy of empagliflozin in reducing heart failure (HF) outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Objectives

The authors examined the outcomes of EMPEROR-Reduced as a function of background diuretic therapy.

Methods

The EMPEROR-Reduced trial was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of placebo vs empagliflozin 10 mg among 3,730 HFrEF patients. Herein, the population was stratified into 4 groups: no diuretic and diuretic dose equivalent to furosemide <40, 40, and >40 mg daily at baseline.

Results

A total of 3,656 patients from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial were available for analysis. Of those patients, 482 (13.2%) were receiving no diuretic therapy, and 731 (20.0%), 1,411 (38.6%), and 1,032 (28.2%) were receiving <40 mg, 40 mg, and >40 mg, respectively. The efficacy of empagliflozin on the primary outcome (time to first event of hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular [CV] death) was consistent regardless of background diuretic therapy (>40 mg: HR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.71-1.10]; 40 mg: HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.51-0.82]; <40 mg: HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.46-0.92]); no diuretic agents: HR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.47-1.29]; P trend test = 0.192). Baseline diuretic doses did not influence the effect of empagliflozin on body weight, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP, or hematocrit at 52 weeks. The safety profile of empagliflozin vs placebo was unaffected by baseline diuretic dose; however, independently of treatment allocation, total rates of adverse events were higher among patients with higher baseline doses of diuretic agents.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin exhibits a consistent effect on time to CV death or HF hospitalization and an unaltered safety profile regardless of baseline diuretic therapy. (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction [EMPEROR-Reduced]; NCT03057977).

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^6a59c1d9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and >30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Empagliflozin in patients with heart Failure, reduced ejection fraction, and volume overload: EMPEROR-reduced trial [^3cdf3c44]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Investigators have hypothesized that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert diuretic effects that contribute to their ability to reduce serious heart failure events, and this action is particularly important in patients with fluid retention.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on symptoms, health status, and major heart failure outcomes in patients with and without recent volume overload.

Methods

This double-blind randomized trial compared the effects of empagliflozin and placebo in 3,730 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, with or without diabetes. Approximately 40% of the patients had volume overload in the 4 weeks before study enrollment.

Results

Patients with recent volume overload were more likely to have been hospitalized for heart failure and to have received an intravenous diuretic agent in an outpatient setting in the previous 12 months, and to experience a heart failure event following randomization, even though they were more likely to be treated with high doses of a loop diuretic agent as an outpatient (all p < 0.001). When compared with placebo, empagliflozin reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, decreased total hospitalizations for heart failure, and improved health status and functional class. Yet despite the predisposition of patients with recent volume overload to fluid retention, the magnitude of these benefits (even after 1 month of treatment) was not more marked in patients with recent volume overload (interaction p values > 0.05). Changes in body weight, hematocrit, and natriuretic peptides (each potentially indicative of a diuretic action of SGLT2 inhibitors) did not track each other closely in their time course or in individual patients.

Conclusions

Taken together, study findings do not support a dominant role of diuresis in mediating the physiological changes or clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on the course of heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction.

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^e6e55ddc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study-average between-group differences in systolic and diastolic BP were −2.6 (95% CI, −3.3 to −1.9) and −0.5 mm Hg (95% CI, −0.9 to −0.1), respectively. In the full trial cohort, there was no evidence of heterogeneity of the effect of empagliflozin on systolic BP when subdivided by sex, baseline eGFR, NT-proBNP (Figure 4), or race, but there was some evidence to suggest a larger systolic BP difference in patients with diabetes (Figure 4). Effects on anthropometry, HbA1c, hematocrit, and BP in the substudy were approximately consistent with the full trial cohort results (–).

Effects on Diuretic Use

Among those participants in the full trial cohort who were not taking a loop diuretic at randomization, 159 of 2453 (6.5%) in the empagliflozin group compared with 212 of 2409 (8.8%) in the placebo group started such medication during follow-up, representing a 26% lower likelihood of a new loop diuretic prescription among the empagliflozin group (risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90).

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^ee144f5b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often coexists with HF due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology, and also as a consequence of HF itself.SGLT2 inhibitors may cause an initial decline in eGFR.Concomitant treatment with loop diuretics and thiazides may predispose, especially in patients with acute HF, to excessive diuresis, dehydration, symptomatic hypotension and pre‐renal failure.However, even if evidence is still limited, no excess in acute renal failure was reported in EMPA‐RESPONSE‐AHF and in the larger EMPULSE trial.In EMPA‐RESPONSE‐AHF, diuretic response, measured as weight change per 40 mg furosemide, was similar, whereas urinary output until day 4 was significantly larger, with empagliflozin versus placebo.Diuresis was mostly related with glycosuria and osmotic diuresis, with no increase in natriuresis, both in diabetic and non‐diabetic patients.Overall, these data suggest that the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is not their main mechanism of action and should not have a major impact on kidney function also in patients with acute HF. In a small study, including 100 diabetic patients hospitalized for decompensated HF, dapagliflozin significantly improved urine output, total fluid loss, and fluid balance, with no significant change in serum potassium or kidney function.Thus, adding a SGLT2 inhibitor may lead to a slight increase in diuresis and may allow a decrease in loop diuretic doses.

### Effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes: an individual participant-level meta-analysis [^972a14b6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains about effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on kidney outcomes in individuals with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (eg, low albuminuria) and those at risk of large acute estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dips on initiation of such treatment. We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany).

Findings

Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·72-0·88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0·73 [0·63-0·85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0·70 [0·63-0·78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0·66 [0·55-0·79]; 490 outcomes). Empagliflozin slowed a chronic annual rate of eGFR decline by 64% (95% CI 59-69) and off-treatment dip-free slope-a post-hoc outcome using randomisation and off-treatment eGFR values available in a subset of 10630 participants-by 64% (54-73). These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibition reduces risk of acute and chronic kidney outcomes irrespective of the size of the acute dip in eGFR. Kidney benefits are evident irrespective of diabetes status, heart failure status, primary cause of kidney disease, and markers of severity of these diseases.

Funding

None.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre pilot study on the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF) [^699f0a65]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Inhibition of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) reduces the risk of death and heart failure (HF) admissions in patients with chronic HF. However, safety and clinical efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute decompensated HF are unknown.

Methods and Results

In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre pilot study, we randomized 80 acute HF patients with and without diabetes to either empagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo for 30days. The primary outcomes were change in visual analogue scale (VAS) dyspnoea score, diuretic response (weight change per 40mg furosemide), change in N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and length of stay. Secondary outcomes included safety and clinical endpoints. Mean age was 76years, 33% were female, 47% had de novo HF and median NT-proBNP was 5236pg/mL. No difference was observed in VAS dyspnoea score, diuretic response, length of stay, or change in NT-proBNP between empagliflozin and placebo. Empagliflozin reduced a combined endpoint of in-hospital worsening HF, rehospitalization for HF or death at 60days compared with placebo [4 (10%) vs. 13 (33%); P = 0.014]. Urinary output up until day 4 was significantly greater with empagliflozin vs. placebo [difference 3449 (95% confidence interval 578-6321) mL; P<0.01]. Empagliflozin was safe, well tolerated, and had no adverse effects on blood pressure or renal function.

Conclusions

In patients with acute HF, treatment with empagliflozin had no effect on change in VAS dyspnoea, diuretic response, NT-proBNP, and length of hospital stay, but was safe, increased urinary output and reduced a combined endpoint of worsening HF, rehospitalization for HF or death at 60days.

### Rationale and design of a randomized trial to test the safety and non-inferiority of canagliflozin in patients with diabetes with chronic heart failure: the CANDLE trial [^73f364e2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Randomization and treatment

Eligible patients with the appropriately signed informed consent will be randomized to either the canagliflozin or glimepiride groups at a ratio of 1:1 using the minimization method with biased coin assignment balancing for age (<65, ≥65 year), HbA1c level (<6.5, ≥6.5 %), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; <40, ≥40 %) at the time of screening. The trial is an open-label design, although the assessor(s) will be blinded to treatment randomization. The assessors will also be blinded to the primary end point, NT-proBNP level, by measurement at a central laboratory.

All participants receive the study drug for 24 weeks. Patients who are assigned to the canagliflozin group receive canagliflozin 100 mg once daily. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial reported small dose-dependent effects of empagliflozin (10 mg vs. 25 mg/day) on metabolic parameters. However, the two dose groups had similar hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes. Some studies on canagliflozin showed that 100 mg/day had sufficient effects on metabolic parameters, while 300 mg/day was slightly more effective. Importantly, only 100 mg/day is approved in Japan, and therefore the dose of canagliflozin is fixed at 100 mg/day in the canagliflozin group. Because of the possible risk of excess diuresis and subsequent dehydration by combined use of canagliflozin and diuretics, the dose of the diuretics may need to be reduced when necessary. Patients assigned to the glimepiride group are started at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mg once or twice daily. According to the individual’s glycemic control, the dose of glimepiride can be increased to 6.0 mg/day. For background therapy in both groups, participants who have been receiving any SGLT2 inhibitor other than canagliflozin need to discontinue it at the start of the washout period, for 4 weeks, prior to receiving the study drug, canagliflozin or glimepiride. While, participants who have been taking a sulfonylurea need to stop taking it in the canagliflozin group and need to change to glimepiride (if needed) in the glimepiride group at the initiation of the study drug (Additional file 1). Because of the possible risk of excess diuresis and subsequent dehydration by combined use of canagliflozin and diuretics, the dose of the diuretics may need to be reduced when necessary.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^9858a200]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF

Acute SGLT2 inhibition causes an initial increase in proximal tubular natriuresis and parallel increase in total natriuresis, measured using fractional sodium and lithium excretion. This acute natriuretic response is further accentuated during concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor and loop diuretic administration, suggesting a synergistic response probably driven by upstream SGLT2 inhibition causing greater sodium delivery to the downstream loop of Henle. While the SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated increase in total natriuresis was evident following 14 days of treatment, counterregulatory adaptations to tubular sodium handling can promote tachyphylaxis to total natriuresis. For instance, proteomic analyses have found that empagliflozin can increase circulating CA and uromodulin, which can cause counterregulatory increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, respectively. SGLT2 inhibition can also activate aldosterone, due to intravascular volume contraction, further promoting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, while osmotic diuresis associated with SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated glucosuria can increase vasopressin to promote fluid retention. Perhaps as a result of these physiological changes, attenuated natriuresis was observed at 14 days compared to 1 day of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, despite remaining elevated compared to placebo at 14 days. Furthermore, urinary sodium excretion or fractional excretion of sodium were not different following longer-term (4–6 weeks) treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo control. Collectively, these findings suggest that counterregulatory adaptations to tubular sodium handling may offset the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibition in chronic HF patients.

The effects of SGLT2 inhibition on reducing plasma volume and extracellular volume also appear modest. The EMPIRE-HF trial examined the change in extracellular volume using EDTA in HF patients randomized to empagliflozin versus placebo for 12 weeks. Empagliflozin reduced estimated extracellular volume compared with placebo by a modest 0.12 l. Other studies also examined changes in extracellular volume with SGLT2 inhibition, often using bioimpedance spectroscopy, and demonstrated reductions ranging from 0.5 to 1 l that tended to attenuate with time. These results are consistent with the tubular effects of SGLT2 inhibition discussed before. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have consistently demonstrated no effect of SGLT2 inhibition on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) following shorter-term (2–24 weeks) treatment. This finding aligns with the inconsistent reductions in surrogates for cardiac filling pressures following 12 weeks of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### Effects of early empagliflozin initiation on diuresis and kidney function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (EMPAG-HF) [^e9ef3d8c]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective diuretic regimens using loop diuretics in patients with acute decompensated heart failure are often limited by the development of worsening kidney function. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors induce glucosuria and sodium excretion with nephroprotective effects in patients with stable heart failure but their role in acute decompensated heart failure is unclear.

Methods

In this single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we randomly assigned patients with acute decompensated heart failure to empagliflozin 25 mg daily or placebo in addition to standard decongestive treatments that included loop diuretics. The primary end point was cumulative urine output over 5 days. Secondary end points included diuretic efficiency, dynamics in markers of kidney function and injury, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide).

Results

Sixty patients were randomized within 12 hours of hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure. Addition of empagliflozin daily to standard medical treatment of acute decompensated heart failure resulted in a 25% increase in cumulative urine output over 5 days (median 10.8 versus 8.7 L mL in placebo, group difference estimation 2.2 L [95% CI, 8.4 to 3.6]; P =0.003). Empagliflozin increased diuretic efficiency compared with placebo (14.1 mL urine per milligram furosemide equivalent [95% CI, 0.6-27.7]; P =0.041) without affecting markers of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 51±19 versus 54±17 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P =0.599) or injury (total urinary protein, 492±845 versus 503±847 mg/g creatinine; P =0.975; and urinary α1-microglobulin, 55.4±38.6 versus 31.3±33.6 mg/g creatinine; P =0.066) with more pronounced decrease in NT-proBNP in the empagliflozin group compared with placebo (-1861 versus -727.2 pg/mL after 5 days; quotient in slope, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.95]; P <0.001). There were no differences in the incidence of safety events between groups.

Conclusions

Early addition of empagliflozin to standard diuretic therapy increases urine output without affecting renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

### Empagliflozin in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome: five Japanese cases [^5753942b]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to exert cardiorenal protective effects in diabetic patients and are widely used clinically. In addition, an increasing number of reports now suggest these drugs may even be beneficial in non-diabetic patients. However, SGLT2 inhibitors are rarely prescribed for kidney transplant recipients due to the risk of renal graft damage and urogenital infections.

Case Presentation

We report the cases of 5 renal transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome who were administered the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which yielded beneficial results in 4 cases. With the exception of one patient with an initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration of empagliflozin elicited beneficial metabolic effects. There were no significant reductions in eGFR before or after empagliflozin administration, and no dehydration or urogenital infections were observed during the treatment course.

Conclusion

Empagliflozin showed some positive effects in 4 cases with better renal function than CKD stage 4. Further studies will be required to clarify the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in a larger group of patients with similar medical conditions.

### Effect of empagliflozin on liver fat in non-diabetic patients (...) [^8edd62f1]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Effect of Empagliflozin on Liver Fat in Non-diabetic PatientsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in reducing hepatic fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF in NAFLD patients without DM. A total of 98 adult patients will be randomly sampled from the liver clinic in our local hospital. They will undergo LSM at baseline, week 26 and 52, and MRI-PDFF at baseline and week 52. The primary outcome will be a difference in change of liver fat content at week 52 from baseline between the two groups. The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients without DM. The novelty of utilizing the concept of "drug repositioning" by changing the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in treating DM to treating NAFLD in patients without DM deserves exploration.

The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in reducing hepatic fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF in NAFLD patients without DM. The secondary outcomes will be remission of steatosis at week 52, reduction of liver fibrosis at week 26 and 52, improvement of laboratory results, improvement of anthropometric measurements, and combined cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hepatic steatosis and regress fibrosis in NAFLD patients without DM. Drug: Empagliflozin 10 MG Drug: Placebo pills

### Acute and chronic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal oxygenation and blood pressure control in nondiabetic normotensive subjects: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^2e636c0a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere. 14 This monocentric research project was approved by the local institutional review committee (ethics committee of the Canton de Vaud, Switzerland) and conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Trial Design

This is a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled study addressing the acute and chronic renal effects of 10 mg empagliflozin given orally in healthy, nonmedicated volunteers.

Study Participants

In brief, a total of 45 healthy volunteers, 18 to 50 years of age, were recruited. Inclusion criteria were absence of diabetes mellitus based on glycated hemoglobin (<6.5%) and oral glucose tolerance (<7 mmol/L fasting, <11.1 mmol/L after 75 g of glucose) testing, a Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration–based estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min per 1.73 m², a urine albumin/creatinine ratio <3.3 mg/mmol, a normal urine dipstick, normal hematology and chemistry results, and a normal renal ultrasound. Among the exclusion criteria were a history of substance abuse and claustrophobia or another contraindication for MRI (pregnancy, implanted metallic devices). Each group was randomized to placebo (n=15) or empagliflozin (n=30). The randomization procedure was done by the hospital's pharmacy on the first day of the acute phase. A 2:1 randomization was chosen to compensate for the possible higher dropout rate in the empagliflozin group due to side effects. Empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo tablets were identical in size and stored in similar boxes containing 30 tablets. Investigators (research nurses, doctors, and technicians) were blinded to treatment.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: the RECEDE-CHF trial [^708732f8]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings may also have clinical implications in patients with decompensated HF and fluid overload. At this time, sequential nephron blockade with thiazide-like diuretics used in combination with loop diuretics is often used to overcome diuretic resistance in acute decompensated chronic HF.However, this strategy does not always work and is associated with the hazards of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, and renal failure. We demonstrated that diuresis without significant natriuresis is quickly achieved by day 3. Potentially, this highlights the SGLT2 inhibitor as an alternative to the thiazide-like diuretics in patients who may have evidence of fluid retention resistance to loop diuretics alone.

Our study has some limitations. It was a small, single-center crossover study with participants who were predominantly male and with a midrange ejection fraction. The crossover design was a strength, with each patient acting as their own control in a blinded study. The dose investigated in this trial was 25 mg empagliflozin once daily, whereas in routine clinical practice the 10 mg dose is most commonly used; however, in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (BI 10773 [Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), no difference in the primary outcome was reported between the 2 treatment groups of 10 mg and 25 mg.At the time we conceived the study (before the publication of EMPA-REG OUTCOME), we hypothesized that there might be a dose–response effect and therefore chose the 25 mg dose in this study. On the day of the 24-hour urine collection, we asked participants to restrict sodium intake to 2 g/d and fluid intake to 2 L/d; however, we could not enforce this because patients were not admitted to hospital but remained at home. Patients attended the RPT days after an overnight fast to minimize any variations in dietary glucose intake. There was no dietary restriction placed on participants while the 24-hour urine collection was performed, and any variation in glucose control may have modified the urinary responses. The effect of glucosuria from SGLT2 inhibition is well-described in the literature,, and as such we did not measure urine glucose in this study. Given that we demonstrated diuresis in the absence of significant natriuresis, it would have been interesting to identify whether there was an association between glucosuria and 24-hour urine volume. Because of time constraints during the RPT days, the patients were observed for only 2 hours after administration of investigational medical product (placebo or empagliflozin) and 1 hour after administration of intravenous furosemide. Any significant diuretic or natriuretic effect may have not been observed during this short time frame, and might have been seen with a longer duration. Assessment of plasma renin activity would also have been of interest in exploring intravascular volume, although this may have been influenced by high use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors in patients with HF. It is unclear whether the changes we saw at 6 weeks would persist for a longer time. One observational of study of patients with T2D, but without HF, reported a reduction in extracellular water at day 3, which had returned to baseline values by 3 months.

### Blinded withdrawal of long-term randomized treatment with empagliflozin or placebo in patients with heart failure [^375477ea]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings should be considered in light of certain strengths and limitations. In a large-scale trial, double-blind therapy was withdrawn by protocol design from patients who completed the treatment period, thus minimizing the confounding of previous observational studies. – Our approach was similar to that in another large-scale trial.The group entering the withdrawal phase represented a less impaired subset of our original randomly assigned patients, because these patients were required to have survived and maintained double-blind treatment. Even at the end of the trial, the groups fortunately were well-balanced with respect to assignment to placebo or empagliflozin, because treatment with empagliflozin did not influence the rates of discontinuation of randomized therapy due to death or other causes. Nevertheless, the analyses performed in the patients included in our withdrawal analyses did not have the protection of randomization; however, we made every effort to adjust for all relevant prognostic variables. To address these potential issues and ensure balance between placebo and empagliflozin groups, we would have needed to perform a trial of several thousand patients who had been taking empagliflozin for years and who would be randomly assigned to continue the drug or be withdrawn into treatment with placebo for a period of several months or longer. Such a design has been carried in the past to evaluate the long-term efficacy of digoxin.

Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the withdrawal of therapy was abrupt (as per protocol) and the period of follow-up off-treatment was brief (≈30 days). The proximal tubular effect of SGLT2 inhibitors elicits compensatory downstream antinatriuretic and antiaquaretic mechanisms that truncate any expected changes in urinary sodium and water excretion. – Abrupt withdrawal allows these counterregulatory mechanisms to become apparent as rebound phenomena, which have been reported when diuretics and vasodilator drugs are used for the treatment of heart failure. – Given the numerically higher event rate after the withdrawal of empagliflozin than in the placebo group before withdrawal, it is reasonable to postulate that a short-term rebound effect may have amplified the magnitude of the changes that we observed after the withdrawal of empagliflozin,thus enhancing estimates of an on-treatment effect. Conversely, our ability to assess the full effect of the discontinuation of treatment on clinical events may have been limited by the brevity of our withdrawal period, which was shorter than that in other drug withdrawal trials in patients with heart failure. With additional time off-treatment, we would have observed more events, thus allowing us to define the between-group differences with greater certainty.

### NCT03132181 | Empagliflozin as a modulator of systemic (...) [^2e739679]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Empagliflozin as a Modulator of Systemic Vascular Resistance and Cardiac Output in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview SGLT2 inhibitors are a novel class of glucose lowering drugs that act in the kidney by inhibiting SGLT2-mediated glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule. The resulting increase in urinary glucose excretion leads to a reduction in plasma glucose levels. This is accompanied by reduction of total body weight due to urinary energy loss. In addition, glucose dependent osmotic diuresis contributes to blood pressure lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibition.
- The glucosuric effects of SGLT2 inhibitors leading
- at least temporarily- to an increase in sodium excretion as well as a reduction in plasma volume due to glucose osmotic diuretic effects and natriuresis.
- SGLT2 inhibition has been suggested to directly affect the tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanism in the kidney.

The increased delivery of solute to the macula densa in the setting of SGLT2 inhibition may reduce hyperglycemia-induced glomerular hyperfiltration via tubulo-glomerular feedback invoking adenosine-dependent pathways, with direct effects on afferent glomerular arteriolar tone that may diminish hyperfiltration acutely and consistently during treatment.
- Several trials have shown that SGLT2-inhibitors lead to a reduction in systolic blood pressure in a range of 3-5 mmHg and about 2-3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. In addition, SGLT2-inhibitors reduce pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure and the product of heart rate-X-systolic blood pressure vs. placebo suggesting an effect on different markers and mediators of arterial stiffness. In a clinical trial from 2015, Chilton et al. supposes positive effects on blood pressure, arterial stiffness and vascular resistance.

So far there is no data about systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in patients with type 2 diabetes with empagliflozin treatment or other SGLT2 inhibitors.
- Consequently, it remains currently unclear whether osmotic diuresis can be accounted for the longer term blood pressure lowering effects of empagliflozin, which remains stable also after new blood glucose equilibrium is reached. Drug: Empagliflozin Other: Placebo

### Acute pharmacodynamic effects of empagliflozin with and without diuretic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^99c02bf6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of co-administration of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, with diuretic agents.

Methods

In a randomized, open-label cross-over study, 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received empagliflozin 25 mg for 5 days and either hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg for 4 days followed by hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus empagliflozin 25 mg for 5 days, or torasemide 5 mg for 4 days followed by torasemide 5 mg plus empagliflozin 25 mg for 5 days; 20 completed treatment. Food, fluid, and sodium intake were standardized for 3 days before and during treatment.

Findings

At baseline, the median age of the treated patients was 56 years (range, 40-65 years), body mass index was 26.8 kg/m 2 (range, 20.1-34.4 kg/m 2 ), fasting plasma glucose was 8.6 mmol/L (range, 6.0-12.9 mmol/L), and glycosylated hemoglobin level was 7.6% (range, 7%-10%). Empagliflozin significantly increased 24-hour urinary glucose excretion and reduced fasting serum glucose levels. These effects were maintained after co-administration with either diuretic. Urinary sodium excretion did not significantly change with empagliflozin or diuretic administration alone, but seemed to increase compared with either diuretic alone when empagliflozin was co-administered with either diuretic. Plasma renin and serum aldosterone levels were unaltered with empagliflozin or torasemide alone, but tended to increase with hydrochlorothiazide alone, and tended to increase when empagliflozin was co-administered with a diuretic compared with either diuretic alone. Urinary volume did not increase with empagliflozin or diuretics alone, but increased when empagliflozin was co-administered with either diuretic.

Implications

Empagliflozin alone for 5 days increased urinary glucose excretion but did not seem to have a relevant impact on urine volume or electrolytes. When empagliflozin was co-administered with a diuretic agent, urinary glucose excretion remained increased, and the renin-angiotensin system was activated.

Outcomes

The substudy's prespecified primary outcome was the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on mean absolute “Fluid Overload” averaged over time, with effects on relative “Fluid Overload” provided for completeness. It was estimated that at least 382 participants would provide >90% power (at a two-sided P value of 0.05) to detect at least a 0.3-L difference in absolute “Fluid Overload” between treatment groups. The key secondary outcome was the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on time to the first event of a cardiovascular composite defined as death from heart failure, heart failure hospitalization, or development of new moderate or severe “Fluid Overload” (in participants without this level of “Fluid Overload” at baseline). The other secondary outcomes were the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on “Fluid Overload” at the different measurement time points. Tertiary assessments are detailed in theand include analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on all ECW (of which “Fluid Overload” is a constituent) and ICW. In addition, the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on total body water (the sum of all ECW and ICW) were assessed as a post hoc analysis to contextualize effects on “Fluid Overload.”

In order for inferences from the bioimpedance substudy to be put in the context of findings from all the available EMPA-KIDNEY data, additional analyses included assessments of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, hematocrit, and BP (systolic and diastolic) in the full trial cohort. Analyses emphasized results of study-average effects including all available measurements from routine trial visit time points (with effects at 2 and 18 months also presented). The full cohort results are emphasized because of greater statistical power and wider generalizability than the substudy. Substudy results were compared with results from the full cohort using standard statistical tests of heterogeneity. Analyses of weight and systolic BP also considered results for the same subgroups as the substudy (plus self-reported race, to explore effects by race in the full trial cohort because the substudy took place in the United Kingdom and Germany only). Prespecified sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome included three analyses assessing any effect of data quality assessments. Analyses of effects of empagliflozin on diuretic use were included post hoc.

Bioimpedance substudy cohort: baseline characteristics

Substudy adherence to study treatment was consistent with adherence in the full-trial population.At 12 months of follow-up (the approximate midpoint of the trial), of substudy participants who remained alive, 282 of 318 (88.7%) in the empagliflozin group and 292 of 320 (91.3%) in the placebo group reported taking at least 80% of their allocated study treatment.

Effects on Bioimpedance-Derived Parameters

The primary assessment found that the study-average mean absolute “Fluid Overload” was 0.24 L lower in those allocated to the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (absolute difference in means −0.24 L, 95% CI, −0.38 to −0.11), with similar differences at 2 months (−0.23 L, 95% CI, −0.37 to −0.08) and 18 months (−0.26 L, 95% CI, −0.46 to −0.06) (Figure 2, Table 2). Findings were robust in sensitivity analyses assessing the effect of data quality assessments. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was similar in subgroups by sex, diabetes status, and across the spectrum of NT-proBNP and eGFR studied (P values for heterogeneity or trend >0.3, Figure 3 and). Neither was there any evidence of heterogeneity in post hoc exploratory subgroups divided by baseline fluid status (fluid depletion, low and high normohydration, and moderate and severe “Fluid Overload”; P = 0.71), diuretic use (P = 0.07), or uACR (P = 0.33,).

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^b7146ac6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥60 to <90 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n=290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n=374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.

Findings

In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0·52% (95% CI -0·72 to -0·32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0·68% (-0·88 to -0·49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p<0·0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0·42% (-0·56 to -0·28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p<0·0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 156 patients (83%) on placebo (15 severe [8%] and 23 serious [12%]) and 156 (83%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (18 severe [10%] and 22 serious [12%]).

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 or 3 CKD, empagliflozin reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. However, our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment.

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^3a314c36]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce risk of kidney progression, AKI, and cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of benefit are incompletely understood. Bioimpedance spectroscopy can estimate body water and fat mass. One quarter of the EMPA-KIDNEY bioimpedance substudy CKD population had clinically significant levels of bioimpedance-derived "Fluid Overload" at recruitment. Empagliflozin induced a prompt and sustained reduction in "Fluid Overload," irrespective of sex, diabetes, and baseline N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide or eGFR. No significant effect on bioimpedance-derived fat mass was observed. The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on body water may be one of the contributing mechanisms by which they mediate effects on cardiovascular risk.

Background

CKD is associated with fluid excess that can be estimated by bioimpedance spectroscopy. We aimed to assess effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition on bioimpedance-derived "Fluid Overload" and adiposity in a CKD population.

Methods

EMPA-KIDNEY was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in patients with CKD at risk of progression. In a substudy, bioimpedance measurements were added to the main trial procedures at randomization and at 2- and 18-month follow-up visits. The substudy's primary outcome was the study-average difference in absolute "Fluid Overload" (an estimate of excess extracellular water) analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures approach.

Results

The 660 substudy participants were broadly representative of the 6609-participant trial population. Substudy mean baseline absolute "Fluid Overload" was 0.4±1.7 L. Compared with placebo, the overall mean absolute "Fluid Overload" difference among those allocated empagliflozin was -0.24 L (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.38 to -0.11), with similar sized differences at 2 and 18 months, and in prespecified subgroups. Total body water differences comprised between-group differences in extracellular water of -0.49 L (95% CI, -0.69 to -0.30, including the -0.24 L "Fluid Overload" difference) and a -0.30 L (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.03) difference in intracellular water. There was no significant effect of empagliflozin on bioimpedance-derived adipose tissue mass (-0.28 kg [95% CI, -1.41 to 0.85]). The between-group difference in weight was -0.7 kg (95% CI, -1.3 to -0.1).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with CKD, empagliflozin resulted in a sustained reduction in a bioimpedance-derived estimate of fluid overload, with no statistically significant effect on fat mass.

14.5 Empagliflozin Chronic Kidney Disease Trial, Including Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The effectiveness of empagliflozin, a component of SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR, to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization has been established in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression based on an adequate and well-controlled study of empagliflozin [EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110)]. This trial was designed to determine the treatment effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo in adults with CKD (with and without type 2 diabetes). The trial, which studied empagliflozin rather than SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, included adults taking metformin HCl as a concomitant medication. The efficacy results of EMPA-KIDNEY are reported below.

EMPA-KIDNEY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease [eGFR ≥20 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥45 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥200 mg/g]. The trial excluded patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the preceding three months or >45 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of screening. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard of care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or CV death. A total of 6,609 patients, were equally randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg orally once-daily or placebo and were followed for a median of 24 months.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^0605f8c9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling >30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Effect of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes after acute myocardial infarction: insights from the EMPACT-MI trial [^492ea9f6]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin reduces the risk of heart failure (HF) events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease, or prevalent HF irrespective of ejection fraction. Whereas the EMPACT-MI trial (Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction) showed that empagliflozin does not reduce the risk of the composite of hospitalization for HF and all-cause death, the effect of empagliflozin on first and recurrent HF events after myocardial infarction is unknown.

Methods

EMPACT-MI was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial that randomized 6522 patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction at risk for HF on the basis of newly developed left ventricular ejection fraction of <45% or signs or symptoms of congestion to receive empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo within 14 days of admission. In prespecified secondary analyses, treatment groups were analyzed for HF outcomes.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 17.9 months, the risk for first HF hospitalization and total HF hospitalizations was significantly lower in the empagliflozin compared with the placebo group (118 [3.6%] versus 153 [4.7%] patients with events; hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60, 0.98]; P =0.031, for first HF hospitalization; 148 versus 207 events; rate ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51, 0.89]; P =0.006, for total HF hospitalizations). Subgroup analysis showed consistency of empagliflozin benefit across clinically relevant patient subgroups for first and total HF hospitalizations. The need for new use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin modulators, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists after discharge was less in patients randomized to empagliflozin versus placebo (all P <0.05).

Conclusions

Empagliflozin reduced the risk of HF in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or congestion after acute myocardial infarction.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^223953c4]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by “inappropriate” (ie, nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD later published by the same authors in 1967 have remained remarkably current (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Criteria for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate diuresis

Over the decades since, understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia that have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the current understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing current guidelines, and to appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is more precisely referred to as low effective osmolality or tonicity. “Effective” osmolytes (eg, sodium, glucose, potassium, organic osmolytes) do not cross the cell membrane freely, so they have the capacity to create osmotic forces to influence the movement of water across cell membranes. In contrast, “ineffective” osmolytes (eg, ethanol, urea) freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not cause water shifts.

In hypotonic hyponatremia the low serum sodium concentration is primarily due to a relative excess of circulating free water, with or without a sodium deficit. Nonhypotonic hyponatremia can either be measured due to a method-dependent laboratory artifact, in which case it is termed pseudohyponatremia, or can be caused by excess of an effective osmolyte in the circulation (eg, hyperglycemia), in which case it is termed translocational hyponatremia (Fig. 1).

3.8 Change in albuminuria

The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial reported changes in albuminuria status for the effect of empagliflozin vs placebo across the subgroup of RAAS‐I users.Though there appeared to be an improvement in albuminuria status in those with baseline RAAS inhibition than those without (Appendix 4), the report noted that there was no significant evidence of interaction across the subgroup. The effect of dapagliflozin on urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR) was similar in patients with or without RAAS inhibition in the pooled analysis of 13 trials(Table 2).

3.9 Other kidney outcomes

The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial reported outcomes for incident or worsening nephropathy, oedema and acute renal failure for the effect of empagliflozin vs placebo across the subgroup of RAAS‐I users.Empagliflozin compared with placebo reduced the risk of the incident or worsening nephropathy, oedema and acute renal failure in those on RAAS inhibition at baseline; the risk was only reduced for oedema in those who were not on RAAS inhibition treatment (Appendix 5).

3.10 Metabolic and haemodynamic parameters

In the pooled analysis of 13 trials, the effect of dapagliflozin on HbA1c and haematocrit was similar in patients with or without RAAS inhibition; however, mean reductions in body weight, serum uric acid, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were more distinct in patients without RAAS inhibition treatment compared with those with RAAS inhibition treatment at baseline(Table 2). The effects of SGLT2 inhibition compared with placebo on the risk of hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia and hypoglycaemia were similar in both groups (Appendix 6).

3.11 Volume depletion

Comparing SGLT2‐Is with placebo in those on RAAS‐I treatment at baseline, the RR (95% CIs) for volume depletion in pooled analysis of two trials was 1.06 (0.84–1.33). The corresponding risk in those not on RAAS‐I treatment at baseline was 0.82 (0.47–1.46) (Appendix 7).

3.12 Genital and urinary tract infections

In pooled analysis of two trials, the effect of SGLT2 inhibition vs placebo on genital infections was similar in patients with or without RAAS inhibition (Appendix 8). For urinary tract infection (UTI), the effect of SGLT2 inhibition vs placebo on UTI was also similar in patients with or without RAAS inhibition (Appendix 9).

Figure 3. 
Schematic diagram of the development of acute vs chronic onset of hyponatremia, explaining typical difference in symptom severity. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. Acute hyponatremia results in relatively hypotonic serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to brain tissue, leading to osmotic influx of water into glial cells to equalise osmolar gradient, which may cause cerebral edema and potential seizure, coma, and death. Chronic hyponatremia often occurs more gradually. As serum/CSF osmolality falls, water enters the brain more slowly and is matched by export or deactivation of brain osmolytes including sodium, potassium, and organic osmolytes (eg, myoinositol, glycerophosphorylcholine, creatine, glutamate, glutamine, taurine) to equalize the osmolar gradient. The resulting hypotonic brain is vulnerable to rapid correction if the reverse process happens too rapidly, which may cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (see Fig. 7).

### Combination therapy as a new standard of care in diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^6499c178]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

RANDOMIZED EVIDENCE SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT AND ADDITIVE BENEFITS OF COMBINATION THERAPY IN CKD

Preclinical and clinical randomized evidence indicate that the combined use of evidence-based kidney therapies may have additive effects compared to individual therapies alone.

The effects of combination kidney therapies have been assessed in several preclinical studies. In a hypertensive animal model, combined treatment with empagliflozin and finerenone resulted in more than additive benefits on albuminuria and improved cardiac and kidney histopathology compared to treatment with either therapy alone. In a preclinical randomized trial using an animal model of Alport syndrome, treatment with ramipril, empagliflozin, and finerenone resulted in greater improvements in cardio–kidney histopathology and longer mean survival compared to treatment with ramipril and empagliflozin in combination, or with empagliflozin or ramipril monotherapy. In particular, the addition of finerenone to ramipril and empagliflozin resulted in further suppression of residual interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Similarly greater benefits on kidney histology have been observed in animal models of type 2 diabetes with ramipril, empagliflozin, and atrasentan compared to each agent individually. These findings provide important mechanistic support for additive end-organ protection with combined use of evidence-based kidney therapies.

Multiple randomized trials have evaluated the effects of combination treatment with SGLT2i and GLP-1RA or agents that block the actions of aldosterone in people with CKD. Collectively, these trials showed that combination treatment reduced cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood pressure, body weight, and glycated haemoglobin to a greater extent than either therapy alone. In the DECREASE trial of 66 patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin and exanetide reduced albuminuria excretion by 40%, which was larger than dapagliflozin (18%) and exanetide (16%) alone. In the ROTATE study, which studied 46 patients with CKD regardless of diabetes, the combination of dapagliflozin and eplerenone reduced albuminuria by 50%, which was larger than either therapy alone. Finally, in a phase 2 trial of patients with CKD (irrespective of diabetes), combined treatment the aldosterone synthase inhibitor BI690517 reduced albuminuria by almost 40%, with or without empagliflozin. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest additive kidney protection can be anticipated using these therapies in combination.

Discussion

The SGLT2 is a high‐capacity and low‐affinity protein that is abundantly expressed in the most proximal part of the renal tubule and has an important role in the reabsorption of glucose. This systematic review and meta‐analysis suggests that SGLT2 significantly reduces SBP and DBP, although findings have to be interpreted in the context of some moderate level of heterogeneity.

Dapagliflozin was the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of patients with T2D, initially in Europe and subsequently in United States and Japan. 67, 68 Several studies have reported beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on SBP and DBP, especially in patients with T2D. 22, 36 It has been reported that treatment either as monotherapy or add‐on therapy with another SGLT2 inhibitor such as canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin, and tofogliflozin is associated with a small but significant reduction in SBP and DBP. 67 Our findings of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on BP are similar to a recent systematic review by Baker et al 69 and a recent meta‐analysis of efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. 70

In addition to their effects on glucose excretion, SGLT inhibitors also inhibit sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. 67 The BP reductions observed with the SGLT2 inhibitors may result from their chronic natriuretic and osmotic diuretic effects. It has been reported that SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary output by between 107 and 470 mL/d. 69 Therefore, the increased urinary sodium excretion may reduce plasma volume, resulting in reduced BP, particularly with increasing age. 20 Moreover, Imprialos et al have also reported a potential direct natriuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. 67

Other possible mechanisms accounting for the BP‐lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors include nephron remodeling, reduction in arterial stiffness, and the effects on weight loss. 71 SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to being effective in the treatment of T2D, appear to have benefits beyond glucose lowering, including effects on weight loss and raising high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 70, 72 Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors may play a significant role in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2D.

### Impact of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on sudden cardiac death: a systematic review and meta-analysis of adjudicated randomized evidence [^2559f48b]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular outcomes in the spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic syndrome. Albeit basic and translational evidence support a putative anti-arrhythmic role, at the clinical level, a lack of consensus has emerged across different studies, and the true impact on sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the effect of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials. A total of 58,569 participants from 8 trials were included, with 30,565 patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors and 28,104 controls assigned to placebo. The median follow-up period was 29 months. We performed pooled analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses to explore the impact on SCD risk across different populations and treatment regimens.

Results

The pooled analysis showed a reduced risk of SCD with SGLT2 inhibitors (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72-0.94; p = 0.0104), with negligible heterogeneity (τ 2 = 0.0000; I 2 = 0.0%; Q = 3.17, p = 0.8687). Subgroup-specific estimates (age, follow-up duration, population, and SGLT2 inhibitor type) did not reach statistical significance. Meta-regression showed no significant moderation by mean age, study duration, or gender. No evidence of publication bias was detected.

Conclusion

Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin may reduce the relative risk of sudden cardiac death. These data expand the spectrum of cardiovascular benefits attributed to SGLT2 inhibition. Further trials specifically designed to address pre-adjudicated arrhythmic endpoints are warranted.

Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study identification and selection

Figure 1 shows the study selection process. The search of relevant databases and manual scanning of reference lists of relevant studies identified 161 potentially relevant citations. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 19 articles remained for full text evaluation. Following detailed evaluation, 10 articles were excluded because (i) population was not relevant (n = 7); (ii) duplicate studies (n = 2); and (iii) treatment comparison not relevant (n = 1). The remaining nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.,,,,,,

FIGURE 1 
Selection of studies included in the meta‐analysis

3.2 Study characteristics and risk of bias

The nine articles comprised eight studies, of which one was based on a pooled individual patient data (IPD) analysis of 13 trials (Table 1). No RCT specifically investigated the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors compared with SGLT2‐Is alone. All eligible studies were based on trials that had investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibition compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and reported subgroup results for those treated with or without RAAS‐Is at baseline. Of the 34,551 total participants, 23,109 involved the comparison of SGLT2‐I vs placebo with RAAS inhibition at baseline and 11,442 involved the comparison of SGLT2‐I vs placebo without RAAS inhibition at baseline. In addition to diabetes, patients had other comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic CVD or heart failure. Patients had been diagnosed with T2DM and were being managed on standard treatment therapies including ACE‐Is/ARBs, diuretics or calcium channel blockers before inclusion into the trials. All included studies were double‐blinded RCTs. All the studies were conducted in multiple countries. The type of SGLT2‐Is used included dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin and sotagliflozin. The majority of trials recruited patients who were at least 18 years old. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 69 years. The treatment duration ranged from 12 weeks to 6.6 years. Using the Cochrane Collaboration tool, all trials demonstrated low risk of bias in the areas of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel and incomplete outcome data. Only one trial demonstrated unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and the majority an unclear risk of bias in the areas of selective reporting and other bias (Appendix 3).

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^980ca291]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulating sympathetic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations. The steady-state mean plasma AUC and Cmaxwere 1,870 nmol∙h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4,740 nmol∙h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range. Empagliflozin does not appear to have time-dependent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Following once-daily dosing, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state.

### The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^a0676293]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2008, the US FDA suggested that new antidiabetic therapies be evaluated for associated alterations of cardiovascular risk, given concerns that specific glucose‐lowering drugs might worsen cardiovascular outcomes (CVOs). 24, 25 Empagliflozin was the first novel SGLT‐2 inhibitor with results on cardiovascular outcomes. The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial (Table 1), which randomized patients to receive 10 mg empagliflozin, 25 mg empagliflozin, or placebo once daily, was a multi‐center trial that included 7020 adults at high cardiovascular risk (based on history of cardiovascular disease) and with glycated hemoglobin between 7.0% and 9.0% (or 10.0% if on stable glucose‐lowering therapy). 26 The primary outcome of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, which was a composite of cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, and non‐fatal stroke, was significantly less likely to occur in the pooled empagliflozin group (10.5%) compared to the placebo group (12.1%, P = 0.04). The secondary outcome, cardiovascular death, occurred in 12.8% of patients in the empagliflozin group compared to 14.3% of the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). 26 Interestingly, there was not a significant change in the rate of myocardial infarction or stroke between the two groups; hospital admission for heart failure, however, was significantly less likely in the empagliflozin group (occurring in 2.7%) vs the placebo group (4.1%, P = 0.002). 26 After the first 12 weeks of the trial, during which glucose‐lowering therapy was held stable, those in the empagliflozin group had glycated hemoglobin levels about 0.5 percentage points lower than those in the control group, with little difference between the 10 and 25 mg/day groups. 26 At 4 years, the difference between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo groups was about 0.3%, although adjustment of antiglucose medications was allowed after week 12. 26 Rates of serious adverse events, adverse events, and overall rates of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis were similar between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group, although adverse, severe adverse and serious adverse events, genital infections, and urinary tract infections were significantly more in the pooled empagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. 26

SGLT2 inhibitors—mechanism of action and systemic effects—act by blocking the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule, which is responsible for approximately 90% of urinary glucose reabsorption; inhibition lowers glucose via glucosuria that is more pronounced with hyperglycemia, diminishes as blood glucose normalizes, and is smaller as eGFR decreases. The risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low unless combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and beyond glycemia these agents cause diuretic and natriuretic effects, promote weight loss, and lower systolic blood pressure. Proposed contributors to cardiovascular and renal benefit include reductions in preload and afterload through diuresis, alterations in myocardial metabolism, and prevention of myocardial fibrosis.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Use of JARDIANCE for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

JARDIANCE was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Efficacy and safety trials with JARDIANCE did not enroll adult patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled, adult patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials were not required to discontinue therapy for worsening of eGFR to less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or initiation of dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

### Empagliflozin in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome: five Japanese cases [^17e730d0]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this report, we describe the efficacy and adverse effects of empagliflozin administered to 5 Japanese patients with CKD G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome after renal transplantation. Empagliflozin showed beneficial effects in 4 patients with better renal function than CKD 4. No adverse events, including deterioration of renal function, were observed in any patient. The number of cases in the literature so far is small, ranging from 8 to 22, and we believe that RCTs with a larger number of patients are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in KTR. Our case series is also small, only five cases, but there are still very few reports worldwide, and we hope that this presentation will trigger further research.

### Effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction according to age: a secondary analysis of EMPEROR-reduced [^040a5495]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation increased with age in both treatment arms (Table 2). Within each age group, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of AEs compared with placebo. Regarding AEs of specific interest in patients aged 75 or older, such as hypotension, hypoglycaemia, volume depletion, urinary tract infections, hypo‐ and hyperkalaemia, empagliflozin was not associated with an increase in these AEs compared with placebo.

Methods

Study Design

The study was approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service (Regional Ethics Committee reference 16/ES/0137) and all patients gave written informed consent before study inclusion. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supplementary information files.

The full details of the RECEDE-CHF trial (SGLT2 Inhibition in Combination With Diuretics in Heart Failure) (NCT03226457) methodology have been published.In brief, RECEDE-CHF was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial conducted in Tayside, Scotland, to compare the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin with placebo. After successful screening for eligibility and safety, participants were randomized to either empagliflozin 25 mg/placebo or placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg for 6 weeks with a minimum of a 2-week washout period between treatment arms. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion with group assignment masked by use of encapsulated study drug/placebo (Figure 1). Randomization was carried out by an independent pharmacist with no other trial role, using block randomization of treatment order using a validated randomization program. Both the investigator and the patient were blinded to the treatment order.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients were eligible if they were 18 to 80 years of age with previously diagnosed T2D, with a documented diagnosis of HF, in New York Heart Association functional Class II or III, with previous echocardiographic evidence of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. HF was deemed to be the diagnosis when there was documentation from the treating clinician of presentation with symptoms or signs consistent with HF requiring treatment with loop diuretics in the presence of an echocardiogram confirming left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. Participants were required to be on stable doses of furosemide (or alternative loop diuretic) for at least 1 month before randomization and not have been hospitalized for HF for at least 3 months before giving consent.

Patients were excluded if they had systolic blood pressure <95 mm Hg at screening visit, had HbA1c <6.0%, had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL/min/73 m 2, were taking regular thiazide diuretics, or had a diagnosis of chronic liver disease or liver enzymes twice the upper limit of normal.

### Empagliflozin, metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^b0abea99]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

In EMPA-KIDNEY, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization; information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)] .

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.54, 0.78)], and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy [HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48, 1.09)].

### A metabolically stable apelin-17 analog decreases AVP-induced antidiuresis and improves hyponatremia [^b4234907]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia, defined in humans as a plasma sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l, is associated with various diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF), liver cirrhosis, diuretic treatment, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Hyponatremia is also associated with high mortality ratesin patients with liver failure, CHF, and chronic kidney disease.

Arginine-vasopressin (AVP or antidiuretic hormone, ADH) type 2 receptors (V2-R) are expressed in the kidney collecting ducts (CDs). By acting on these receptors, AVP increases cAMP production, leading to the insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) into the apical membrane of CD, allowing water reabsorption and decreasing urine output (Fig. 1). In SIAD, plasma AVP levels are inappropriately increased with respect to plasma osmolality. V2-R antagonists, such as tolvaptan, block the stimulation of V2-R by AVP, and have been shown to correct hyponatremia efficiently in rodentsas well as in humans with SIAD –. Expected effects of aquaretic agents such as intense thirst, polyuria (24 h diuresis up to 6 L per day) and nocturia were observed. Tolvaptan at the dose of 7.5 mg per day was also reported to carry a significant risk of overly rapid sodium correction in 23% of hyponatremia patients having baseline serum sodium concentration <125 mmol/l. These patients exhibit the highest risk of developing osmotic demyelination syndrome when overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurs,. Chronic treatment with V2-R antagonists has also shown efficacy in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, aquaresis-related events led 8% of patients with ADPKD receiving tolvaptan to discontinue treatment –. Therefore, the development of therapeutic agents acting on different targets with a different mode of action could be useful for the treatment of disorders linked to excessive AVP secretion such hyponatremia and ADPKD.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist in the conduct and reporting of this study. We did a systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases via Ovid to cover the period from database inception to Sept 5, 2022. Further details and search terms are listed in the appendix (pp 3–7). Trials were eligible if they assessed SGLT2 inhibitors (including combined SGLT1/2 inhibitors) and if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled (excluding crossover trials), performed in adults (age ≥18 years), large (defined as ≥500 participants in each arm, thereby minimising any potential for publication bias to distort findings), at least 6 months in duration, and reported any of the prespecified efficacy or safety outcomes. Titles and abstracts were initially screened for relevance and duplicates by one author (AJR). The EMPA-KIDNEY trial baseline reportwas available while the final reportwas unpublished at the time of the search. Subsequent screening of full texts and risk of bias assessments (with version 2 of the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool) were completed independently by two authors (KJM, AJR) with conflicts resolved by consensus discussion.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: from the EMPULSE trial [^d8ee8758]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction.We recently demonstrated that initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients who were hospitalized for acute heart failure resulted in significant clinical benefit in the 90 days after starting treatment.

Randomized clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure all demonstrate similar effects on renal function.,,,During the first weeks of administration, SGLT2 inhibitors cause an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 2–4 ml/min/1.73 m 2. This is followed by a slower decline in eGFR over time than placebo‐treated patients, eventually attenuating a decline in renal function. In addition, acute renal events occur less frequently in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors than those on placebo.,,,

In patients with acute heart failure, worsening renal function frequently occurs.Worsening renal function may occur during effective decongestion with loop diuretics which is not associated with worse outcomes.In contrast, worsening renal function due to haemodynamic deterioration is associated with an increased risk of worsening heart failure, heart failure readmissions and (cardiovascular) death.

Since changes in renal function are greater and occur more frequently in acute heart failure, drugs that influence renal function might have a distinct impact on changes in eGFR during a hospitalization for heart failure. Further, changes in eGFR may influence initiation and continuation of guideline‐directed medical therapies. However, the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors during an acute heart failure hospital admission have not been well established. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function and renal events during hospital admission and early after discharge. Secondly, we aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on mortality, heart failure events and quality of life across the eGFR spectrum.

Endocrine Society—sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in CKD: SGLT2 inhibitors generally become less effective as GFR decreases, and because of a small increase in adverse events related to intravascular volume contraction, no more than 100 mg once daily of canagliflozin should be used in patients with an eGFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin should be stopped if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and dapagliflozin should be stopped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, primarily because of a decrease in efficacy. Interestingly, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to delay the progression of CKD.

### Challenges and opportunities in real-world evidence on the renal effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^fd19157f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES WITH

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of T2D.They lower glycaemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion. In turn, glycosuria results in a significant reduction in body weight, osmotic diuresis, and reduction in blood pressure.In Italy, first‐in‐class dapagliflozin received reimbursement approval in March 2015. Since then, large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have been performed to test the noninferiority of SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo (eg, standard care with alternative glucose‐lowering medications [GLMs]) in terms of cardiovascular safety. In the EMPA‐REG Outcome trial,the CANVAS trial programme,and the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial,however, a significant reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and/or hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) was reported among patients randomized to empagliflozin, canagliflozin or dapagliflozin, respectively. Empagliflozin also reduced all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. In addition, by exploring secondary renal outcomes (either prespecified or not), these three CVOTs showed significant renal protective effects, both in terms of reducing albuminuria progression and slowing the decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time.,Similar results have been obtained in the VERTIS‐CV trial where, despite not meeting superiority versus placebo for the primary cardiovascular endpoint, ertugliflozin reduced the risk of hHF and the rate of a prespecified exploratory composite renal endpoint.However, most of these trials were not specifically designed to address renal outcomes and, most importantly, the percentage of patients with CKD was low, ranging from 27% in EMPA‐REG and 20% in CANVAS to only 7% in DECLARE‐TIMI 58.This was to preserve the glycaemic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors, whose glucose‐lowering effect is reduced at lower eGFR values because of less glucose being filtered.As indication for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for prevention and delaying of the progression of DKD should not be drawn from secondary analyses, an advancement was achieved thanks to the CREDENCE trial.CREDENCE enrolled 4401 patients with T2D, stage II to III CKD, and macroalbuminuria, who were receiving standard of care including a maximum tolerated daily dose of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and were randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo. The study demonstrated a 30% reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint (progression to ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine or renal/cardiovascular death) in the canagliflozin group. The study also showed a reduced risk of secondary cardiovascular endpoints, including the risk of cardiovascular death and hHF by 31%, MACE (composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular death) by 20%, and the risk of hHF alone by 39% in the canagliflozin arm. CREDENCE provides solid evidence in favour of nephroprotection exerted by SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and is changing the treatment paradigm of T2D patients with DKD. However, the study population in which such striking results have been obtained is representative of a minority of the whole population of T2D with impaired renal function. Data from the RIACE study,a prospective ongoing study under the auspices of the Italian Diabetes Society, showed that approximately 37.5% of T2D patients have a certain degree of impaired renal function, but only 4% combine macroalbuminuria with an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (ie, the CREDENCE‐like population). Furthermore, the prevailing phenotype of renal impairment in T2D seems to be the normoalbuminuric one, that is, patients who progressively lose eGFR but remain normoalbuminuric over time. This normoalbuminuric DKD phenotype, whose prevalence ranges from 35% to over 65% in different studies, has been confirmed in clinical trials and real‐world cohorts.These patients rapidly progress toward ESKD and are characterized by a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and elevated risk of all‐cause mortality,,thereby representing a wide high‐risk subset of individuals with T2D for whom most effort should be exerted to improve renal and cardiovascular outcomes. For these reasons, the major limitation of the CREDENCE trial lies in the marginal proportion of patients who satisfy its enrolment criteria, making it hard to extrapolate trial results to other, more common, clinical phenotypes of DKD. This gap is being partially filled by the ongoing EMPA‐KIDNEY trial, which will include patients with an eGFR of 20 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or an eGFR of 45 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with albuminuria greater than or equal to 200 mg/g.On the other hand, the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin improved cardiovascular outcomes but not the composite renal outcome in patients with T2D and CKD (eGFR 25‐60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with or without micro‐/macroalbuminuria),possibly because of short duration (14.2 months) or due to molecular specificity.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^48340166]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration <135 mmol/L, is one of the most common electrolyte disorders in hospitalized patients. While acute hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema with severe symptoms and requires prompt treatment with hypertonic saline, chronic hyponatremia does not pose an immediate risk. However, it can also have several adverse effects, including neurocognitive impairment, gait instability and falls, and osteoporosis and fractures, some of which are reversible upon treatment. This provides a rationale for the treatment of chronic hyponatremia, although overcorrection should be avoided to prevent the development of the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

The most common cause of chronic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). In SIAD, the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) impairs free water excretion and treatment therefore relies on fluid restriction or stimulation of free water excretion. Although fluid restriction is an effective first-line treatment for hyponatremia secondary to SIAD, patients with severe antidiuresis often require additional treatment to increase free water excretion. Second-line treatments for SIAD include vasopressin receptor antagonists, loop diuretics, sodium chloride tablets, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and oral urea. Of these options, oral urea is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for SIAD because it produces a gradual correction of hyponatremia. Urea is a crystalline powder that is administered at a dose of 15–60 g per day and increases free water excretion by inducing osmotic diuresis. In a patient with SIAD who has a “fixed” urine osmolality of 500 mOsm/kg, solute intake of 700 mOsm/day and water intake of 2 L/day, adding 30 g urea (molecular weight 60 g/mol) will increase solute intake by 500 mOsm and will result in a negative water balance [urine volume = number of osmoles/urine osmolality, (700 + 500)/500 = 2.4 L].

### Effects of empagliflozin on renal sodium and glucose handling in patients with acute heart failure [^0ade1ec3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve clinical outcome in patients with heart failure (HF), but the mechanisms behind their beneficial effects are not yet fully understood. We examined the effects of empagliflozin on renal sodium and glucose handling in patients with acute HF.

Methods and Results

This study was a pre-defined sub-study of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF). Patients were allocated within 24h of an acute HF admission to either empagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 40) or placebo (n = 39) for 30days. Markers of glucose and sodium handling were measured daily during the first 96h and at day 30. Patients were 76 (range 38-89) years old and 33% had diabetes. The use of loop diuretics during the first 96h was similar in both groups. Empagliflozin increased fractional glucose excretion with a peak after 24h (21.8% vs. 0.1%; P<0.001), without affecting plasma glucose concentration, while fractional sodium and chloride excretion and urinary osmolality remained unchanged (P >0.3 for all). However, empagliflozin increased plasma osmolality (delta osmolality at 72h: 5±8 vs. 2±5 mOsm/kg; P = 0.049). Finally, there was an early decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate with empagliflozin vs. placebo (-10±12 vs. -2±12mL/min/1.73m 2 ; P = 0.009), which recovered within 30days.

Conclusion

In patients with acute HF, empagliflozin increased fractional glucose excretion and plasma osmolality, without affecting fractional sodium excretion or urine osmolality and caused a temporary decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. This suggests that empagliflozin stimulates osmotic diuresis through increased glycosuria rather than natriuresis in patients with acute HF.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^bb8710fc]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure—SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial “four pillar” approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

### Empagliflozin in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome: five Japanese cases [^95253b72]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The only randomized clinical trial (RCT) of SGTL2 inhibitor treatment in patients with PTDM is Halden et al. They compared 22 empagliflozin-treated patients with 22 placebo-treated patients. The results showed that empagliflozin-treated patients had significantly HbA1c, uric acid and body weight reduction, and than placebo-treated patients. There was no change in eGFR before or after SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in the empagliflozin group. Three cases of urinary tract infection were seen in each group, and one case of urosepsis in the empagliflozin group was discontinued. Other adverse events were minor and did not differ between the two groups. In our case, diabetes mellitus was present in three of the five cases, and the other two cases had metabolic syndrome but not diabetes mellitus. Therefore, in the three diabetic patients, HbA1c decreased. But in the two patients with metabolic syndrome, HbA1c was relatively low before empagliflozin administration and did not change after the drug was administered. With regard to uric acid, febuxostat was administered in 4 of the 5 patients, and serum uric acid levels were low at the time of drug initiation, and no pre- or post-dose changes were observed overall. In the present case, weight decreased in three of the five diabetic patients and increased or remained unchanged in the other two patients with metabolic syndrome.

Recently, Jenssen reviewed the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with PTDM. Jenssen noted that precautions for SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with PTDM include genitourinary tract infections, ketoacidosis and decreased renal function, including acute kidney injury (AKI) due to dehydration associated with increased urinary glucose. He summarized that urinary tract infections were not more frequent in KTR than in other patients who received SGLT2 inhibitors, and that bacterial genital infections were in the range expected in KTR in all studies and also seen in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D—An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^b1019cab]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, SGLT-2 inhibitors, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that a reversible decrease in the eGFR with the commencement of SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment may occur and is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

### Similarities and distinctions between acetazolamide and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with acute heart failure: key insights into ADVOR and EMPULSE [^2c29c776]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Both acetazolamide and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors block sodium reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule primarily through inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), but neither SGLT2 inhibitors nor acetazolamide produce a sustained natriuresis due to compensatory upregulation of sodium reabsorption at distal nephron sites. Nevertheless, acetazolamide and SGLT2 inhibitors have been used as adjunctive therapy to loop diuretics in states where NHE3 is upregulated, e.g. acute heart failure. Two randomized controlled trials have been carried out with acetazolamide in acute heart failure (DIURESIS-CHF and ADVOR). In ADVOR, acetazolamide improved physical signs of fluid retention, but this finding could not be explained by the modest observed diuretic effect. Acetazolamide did not produce a natriuresis in the DIURESIS-CHF trial, and in ADVOR, immediate effects on symptoms and body weight were not reported, and the drug had no effect on morbidity or mortality after 90days. Three randomized controlled trials have been carried out with empagliflozin (EMPAG-HF, EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF and EMPULSE) in acute heart failure. The EMPULSE trial did not report effects on diuresis or in changes in physical signs of congestion during the first week of treatment, but in EMPAG-HF and EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF, empagliflozin had no effect of dyspnoea, urinary sodium excretion or body weight during the first 4days. In the EMPULSE trial, empagliflozin improved health status at 15days and reduced the risk of worsening heart failure events at 90days, but these effects are similar in magnitude and time course to the early statistical significance on the risk of heart failure hospitalizations achieved within 14-30days in the major trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure. Neurohormonal inhibitors produce this early effect in the absence of a diuresis. Additionally, in numerous randomized controlled trials, in-hospital diuretic intensification has not reduced the risk of major heart failure events, even when treatment is sustained. These findings, taken collectively, suggest that any immediate diuretic effects of acetazolamide and SGLT2 inhibitors in acute heart failure are not likely to influence the short- or long-term clinical course of patients.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)—cardiorenal effects and prioritization—are summarized, noting that SGLT2is “continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, <45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)” and “modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL).” Cardiovascular outcome trials report “Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality” and “Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs.” Regulatory indications include that “the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria” and “Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression.” Consequently, “individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions.”

### Comparison of the clinical effect of empagliflozin on glycemic and non-glycemic parameters in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease treated with or without baseline metformin [^680dd3ef]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, when considering recent positive CVOTs on SGLT2 inhibitors, the cardiovascular benefits of this class of drug are likely independent of their glucose-lowering effect. It is well known that SGLT2 inhibitors have clinically multifaceted non-glycemic actions beyond their glucose-lowering action, such as body weight (BW) loss, a BP-lowering action, and cardiorenal protection,. In the original randomized population of the EMBLEM trial, 24 weeks of empagliflozin treatment, relative to placebo, reduced BMI significantly and tended to decrease systolic and diastolic BP. However, only a small amount of data is currently available on the assessment of the non-glycemic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors according to prior use of metformin therapy. In the current study the reduction in systolic BP and resultant double product, and BMI induced by empagliflozin was greater in patients who had received baseline metformin therapy compared to that observed in metformin-naïve patients. Although the precise reason(s) for these different effects remains unclear, the higher levels of systolic BP and a lower prescription rate for diuretics at baseline in patients on metformin compared with non-users may have enhanced the results in the present study. The different effects of empagliflozin on some parameters that we observed may therefore be associated with variabilities in the relevant backgrounds of the participants.

There is evidence that the effect of chronic metformin treatment on BW and BMI is to cause a mild reduction in BW, also in Japanese patients with T2D, although the detailed mechanism of this effect of metformin on BW loss has yet to be fully understood. In addition, Apolzan et al. reported recently that chronic metformin treatment was also effective for maintaining a reduction in BW over time in subjects with a high-risk of developing diabetes. These results might indicate that the baseline use of metformin helps to enhance and retain the immediate BW-reducing effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in the present study. Furthermore, combination therapy of a SGLT2 inhibitor and metformin might have efficiently promoted BW loss through intrinsic insulin saving, selective fat mass reduction, and mitigation of compensatory overeating induced by chronic administration of SGLT2 inhibitors. Collectively, this combination therapy may provide synergistic benefits in some non-glycemic parameters, and as a consequence deliver a comprehensive therapeutic approach for diabetes-related complications, beyond that provided by lowering of glucose levels.
