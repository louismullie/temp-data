## Question

Indications for CABG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework for revascularization decisions. Then, I should verify the anatomic indications that confer survival benefit with CABG. Next, I will examine symptomatic indications and when revascularization improves quality of life. After that, I need to consider special populations such as diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and prior CABG. I will then review acute coronary syndromes and mechanical complications. Finally, I should confirm technical conduit choices and the role of the Heart Team, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes survival-improving indications from symptom-improving indications, while noting where evidence is evolving or uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the decision framework so I don't jump to conclusions: revascularization in stable ischemic heart disease is generally considered when there is either a survival benefit with CABG or a symptom benefit when angina persists despite guideline-directed medical therapy, and this should be individualized via a Heart Team that integrates anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with the ISCHEMIA trial informing that routine revascularization does not improve outcomes over optimized medical therapy in many stable patients without high-risk features [^4a3e9035] [^0d790f0f] [^96e7f3e9].

> I will now examine the anatomic indications that improve survival with CABG, starting with left main coronary artery disease. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: contemporary guidelines give CABG a Class I recommendation to improve survival in significant left main stenosis, while PCI is a reasonable alternative in selected patients with low-to-intermediate anatomic complexity, supported by randomized trials and pooled analyses showing no mortality difference in left main disease but higher repeat revascularization with PCI, and a pooled IPD analysis suggesting a modest mortality advantage for CABG in multivessel disease but not in isolated left main disease [^4df3d258] [^0dd46160] [^650aa230].

> Next, I should review multivessel coronary artery disease. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit: CABG confers a survival advantage over PCI in complex multivessel disease, particularly with diabetes and higher SYNTAX scores, with a pooled analysis showing lower 5-year mortality after CABG versus PCI and meta-analyses demonstrating fewer myocardial infarctions and less repeat revascularization with CABG, while stroke risk is higher perioperatively with CABG; guidelines emphasize using SYNTAX to stratify complexity and favor CABG in higher-complexity anatomy [^0dd46160] [^d2554471] [^a7781471] [^4a3e9035].

> Let me consider ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. I should confirm that the signal is strongest when EF is 35% or less: the STICH program showed improved long-term survival with CABG plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone in patients with EF 35% or less, and contemporary heart failure guidelines endorse surgical revascularization in selected patients with HF and suitable coronary anatomy; importantly, REVIVED-BCIS2 did not show benefit for PCI in this population, reinforcing that the survival signal is CABG-specific in reduced EF [^739e1d62] [^9ee7b497] [^0afe0c13].

> Now, I need to check symptomatic indications where revascularization improves quality of life rather than survival. Refractory angina despite guideline-directed medical therapy is a Class I indication for revascularization, and CABG provides more durable angina relief than PCI in many series, with better freedom from angina at 1 to 5 years; however, I should double-check that this applies when ischemia is documented and stenoses are significant and amenable to revascularization, aligning with chronic coronary disease guidance [^4a3e9035] [^055376a2] [^9c253073].

> But wait, what if the patient has diabetes and multivessel disease? I should confirm that diabetes amplifies the CABG benefit: FREEDOM and subsequent analyses show that in diabetics with multivessel CAD, CABG reduces mortality and major adverse cardiac events compared with PCI, and contemporary guidelines recommend CABG over PCI in this scenario when anatomy is suitable, especially with LAD involvement [^b1c71e0c] [^a7781471].

> I will now examine patients with prior CABG and recurrent ischemia. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about repeating surgery: redo CABG carries higher risk, so PCI is often favored when feasible, but I should verify that chronic total occlusion of a saphenous vein graft is a situation where PCI should be avoided; observational data suggest worse outcomes when patients eligible for CABG decline surgery and undergo PCI, underscoring the need for careful Heart Team selection and shared decision-making in this group [^120e648f] [^52868d59] [^e67ada28].

> Next, I should review acute coronary syndromes and mechanical complications. In STEMI with cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, CABG is a Class I option when PCI is not feasible or has failed, and in mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, or free wall rupture, CABG at the time of surgical repair is recommended; for NSTE-ACS with complex multivessel disease, elective CABG after culprit-vessel PCI is appropriate when indicated, again with Heart Team input [^636494da] [^7d9e834c] [^1b312761].

> Let me think about conduit strategy because it influences durability and outcomes. I should confirm that using the left internal mammary artery to the LAD is a Class I recommendation, and that a radial artery is preferred over a saphenous vein for the second most important non-LAD target; bilateral internal mammary artery grafting can be considered in appropriate patients to improve long-term outcomes, balancing sternal wound risks, and intraoperative graft flow assessment is reasonable to ensure technical success [^eb12ceb8] [^4bc5cd4d] [^c40ce89c] [^13bacb84].

> I need to ensure I address the role of the Heart Team and risk stratification. The STS risk score should be calculated for surgical candidates, and complex anatomy, diabetes, reduced EF, and patient preferences should be integrated; importantly, when patients who are good surgical candidates decline CABG and choose PCI, event rates are higher, which should be transparently discussed during shared decision-making [^dcdfd1fa] [^52868d59] [^e67ada28].

> Let me reconsider areas of uncertainty so I don't overstate. For stable ischemic heart disease without high-risk anatomic features, contemporary trials like ISCHEMIA show no mortality benefit from routine revascularization over optimized medical therapy, so I should emphasize that many stable patients will not live longer with revascularization; ongoing trials such as STICH3C will clarify CABG versus contemporary PCI in ischemic cardiomyopathy, and EXCEL versus NOBLE illustrate that left main outcomes can vary by endpoint definition and follow-up, reinforcing the need for individualized decisions [^0d790f0f] [^1197de6f] [^650aa230].

> In summary, I should confirm the following hierarchy: CABG is indicated to improve survival in significant left main disease, complex multivessel disease especially with diabetes, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced EF; CABG is indicated to improve symptoms in refractory angina despite medical therapy; special contexts include prior CABG where PCI may be preferred but vein graft CTOs should not be stented, and ACS with shock or mechanical complications where CABG is lifesaving; throughout, conduit selection and Heart Team review optimize outcomes, and patients should be counseled that survival benefits are anatomy- and risk-dependent, not universal in stable disease [^4df3d258] [^b1c71e0c] [^739e1d62] [^4a3e9035] [^eb12ceb8].

---

CABG is indicated for **left main disease** [^4df3d258], **complex multivessel CAD** (especially with diabetes) [^b1c71e0c] [^0dd46160], and **ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ≤ 35%** [^739e1d62] to improve survival. It is also indicated for **refractory angina despite optimal medical therapy** [^055376a2] and for **mechanical complications of MI** (e.g. ventricular septal defect, papillary muscle rupture) [^636494da]. CABG is preferred over PCI when anatomy is complex (SYNTAX > 22) [^a7781471], when complete revascularization is needed [^c5368454], or when long-term durability is prioritized [^c5368454]. Decisions should be made by a Heart Team [^4a3e9035] considering patient-specific factors and preferences [^4d1e5559].

## Anatomical indications

Key anatomical indications for CABG:

| **Anatomical indication** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) | Class I | Strongly recommended to improve survival [^4df3d258] |
| Complex multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD) | Class I | Strongly recommended, especially with diabetes or high SYNTAX score [^b1c71e0c] [^a7781471] |
| Triple-vessel disease with proximal LAD involvement | Class I | Strongly recommended [^b1c71e0c] |
| Two-vessel disease with significant proximal LAD stenosis | Class I | Strongly recommended [^notfound] |

---

## Physiological indications

Physiological indications include **ischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%** [^739e1d62], for which CABG improves survival and reduces cardiovascular events [^739e1d62]. It is also indicated for **refractory angina pectoris** that persists despite optimal medical therapy and significant coronary stenosis amenable to revascularization [^055376a2].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific factors

- **Diabetes mellitus**: CABG is preferred over PCI in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease due to improved long-term outcomes [^b1c71e0c] [^0dd46160].
- **Age and comorbidities**: Younger patients with low surgical risk benefit from CABG's durability; older or high-risk patients may favor PCI after Heart Team discussion [^4a3e9035] [^4d1e5559].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, especially when equipoise exists between CABG and PCI [^4d1e5559].

---

## Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)

In ACS, **STEMI with cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability** warrants CABG when PCI is not feasible or has failed [^7d9e834c]. Mechanical complications — such as ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, or free wall rupture — require **CABG at the time of surgical repair** [^636494da].

---

## Contraindications and considerations

Contraindications include **severe comorbidities** (e.g. advanced malignancy, severe liver failure) and **high surgical risk** (e.g. severe frailty, recent stroke) [^notfound]. Off-pump CABG may be considered for high-risk patients to reduce perioperative complications, though evidence is mixed [^6bd8d794].

---

## Summary of indications

- **Left main disease**: Improves survival [^4df3d258].
- **Complex multivessel disease**: Especially with diabetes or high SYNTAX score [^b1c71e0c] [^a7781471].
- **Ischemic cardiomyopathy**: LVEF ≤ 35% [^739e1d62].
- **Refractory angina**: Despite optimal medical therapy [^055376a2].
- **Mechanical complications of MI**: VSD, papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture [^636494da].

---

CABG is indicated for **anatomically complex CAD**, **ischemic cardiomyopathy**, and **refractory angina**, with decisions individualized by a Heart Team [^4a3e9035] considering patient factors and preferences [^4d1e5559].

Appropriate use criteria integrate guidelines, clinical trial evidence, and expert opinion in order to determine the most appropriate care for a range of distinct clinical scenarios. Inappropriate use estimates cannot be neglected. Approximately 12%-14% of all percutaneous coronary interventions and 1%-2% of all coronary artery bypass grafting procedures in patients with stable angina are deemed inappropriate. Several reasons for this difference are identified. Continuous improvement of the criteria, multidisciplinary discussions, and the correct financial incentives will be essential in reducing the number of inappropriate procedures, improve patient outcomes, and contain costs.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting: part 2 – optimizing outcomes and future prospects [^160f9e77]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Since first introduced in the mid-1960s, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has become the standard of care for patients with coronary artery disease. Surprisingly, the fundamental surgical technique itself did not change much over time. Nevertheless, outcomes after CABG have dramatically improved over the first 50 years. Randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to CABG have shown converging outcomes for select patient populations, providing more evidence for wider use of PCI. It is increasingly important to focus on the optimization of the short- and long-term outcomes of CABG and to reduce the level of invasiveness of this procedure. This review provides an overview on how new techniques and widespread consideration of evolving strategies have the potential to optimize outcomes after CABG. Such developments include off-pump CABG, clampless/anaortic CABG, minimally invasive CABG with or without extending to hybrid procedures, arterial revascularization, endoscopic vein harvesting, intraprocedural epiaortic scanning, graft flow assessment, and improved secondary prevention measures. In addition, this review represents a framework for future studies by summarizing the areas that need more rigorous clinical (randomized) evaluation.

### Current practice of state-of-the-art surgical coronary revascularization [^8718b71d]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting remains one of the most commonly performed major surgeries, with well-established symptomatic and prognostic benefits in patients with multivessel and left main coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current indications, contemporary practice, and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting. Despite an increasingly higher-risk profile of patients, outcomes have significantly improved over time, with significant reductions in operative mortality and perioperative complications. Five- and 10-year survival rates are ≈85% to 95% and 75%, respectively. A number of technical advances could further improve short- and long-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting. Developments in off-pump and no-touch procedures; epiaortic scanning; conduit selection, including bilateral internal mammary artery and radial artery use; intraoperative graft assessment; minimally invasive procedures, including robotic-assisted surgery; and hybrid coronary revascularization are discussed.

### The choice of conduits in coronary artery bypass surgery [^77b8dbec]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting is the most common cardiac surgery operation performed worldwide. It is the most effective revascularization method for several categories of patients affected by coronary artery disease. Although coronary artery bypass grafting has been performed for more than 40 years, no detailed guidelines on the choice of coronary artery bypass grafting conduits have been published and the choice of the revascularization strategy remains more a matter of art than of science. Moreover, there is a clear contradiction between the proven benefits of arterial grafting and its very limited use in everyday clinical practice. In the hope of encouraging wider diffusion of arterial revascularization and to provide a guide for clinicians, we discuss current evidence for the use of different conduits in coronary artery bypass surgery and propose an evidence-based algorithm for the choice of the second conduit during coronary artery bypass operations.

### Adherence of catheterization laboratory cardiologists to American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines for percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass graft surgery: what happens in actual practice? [^87651712]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have issued guidelines for the use of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for many years, but little is known about the impact of these evidence-based guidelines on referral decisions.

Methods and Results

A cardiac catheterization laboratory database used by 19 hospitals in New York State was used to identify treatment (CABG surgery, PCI, medical treatment, or nothing) recommended by the catheterization laboratory cardiologist for patients undergoing catheterization with asymptomatic/mild angina, stable angina, and unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction between January 1, 2005, and August 31, 2007. The recommended treatment was compared with indications for these patients based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Of the 16 142 patients undergoing catheterization who were found to have coronary artery disease, the catheterization laboratory cardiologist was the final source of recommendation for 10 333 patients (64%). Of these 10 333 patients, 13% had indications for CABG surgery, 59% for PCI, and 17% for both CABG surgery and PCI. Of the patients who had indications for CABG surgery, 53% were recommended for CABG and 34% for PCI. Of the patients with indications for PCI, 94% were recommended for PCI. For the patients who had indications for both CABG surgery and PCI, 93% were recommended for PCI and 5% for CABG surgery. Catheterization laboratory cardiologists in hospitals with PCI capability were more likely to recommend patients for PCI than hospitals in which only catheterization was performed.

Conclusions

Patients with coronary artery disease receive more recommendations for PCI and fewer recommendations for CABG surgery than indicated in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation versus coronary artery bypass surgery for treatment of left main coronary artery disease: is it time to change guidelines? [^cef0f627]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

On the basis of clinical trials comparing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) with medical therapy, current guideline recommend CABG as the treatment of choice for patients with asymptomatic ischemia, stable angina, or unstable angina/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction who have left main coronary artery disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention can be selectively performed in patients who are candidates for revascularization but who are ineligible for CABG. However, because of advances in periprocedural and postprocedural medical care in patients undergoing either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting, new evaluation, and a review of current indications, may be required to determine the standard of care for patients with left main coronary artery disease. Current evidences indicate that stenting results in mortality and morbidity rates that compared favorably with those seen after CABG, suggesting that a current guideline (the Class III recommendation of percutaneous coronary intervention for unprotected left main coronary artery disease) may no longer be justified. Data from several extensive registries and a large clinical trial may have prompted many interventional cardiologists to select percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting as an alternative revascularization strategy for such patients. In addition, these data may inform future guidelines and support the need for well-designed, adequately powered, prospective, randomized trials comparing the 2 revascularization strategies. The cumulative evidence from ongoing and future clinical trials will change the current clinical practice of revascularization for unprotected left main coronary artery disease, which was introduced several decades ago and which has continued to date without major revision.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3b448943]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Figure 3 — Revascularization in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) is organized under "Indications to improve symptoms" and "Anatomic indications to improve survival". Patients with "Refractory angina on medical therapy?" who meet symptomatic criteria proceed to "Revascularization (1)". For anatomic disease, the algorithm evaluates "Multivessel CAD with anatomy suitable for PCI or CABG?" and, when ventricular function is relevant, asks "Ischemic cardiomyopathy EF ≤ 50%?" and specifies "EF ≤ 50% and triple-vessel disease". Decision-making support includes "Heart Team discussion (1)" and the option of "GDMT with or without PCI". The legend clarifies terms and states that "This algorithm summarizes the recommendations in this guideline for the care of patients with stable CAD", and that clinicians are "encouraged to use a Heart Team approach when care decisions are unclear", with abbreviations defined (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], coronary artery disease [CAD], ejection fraction [EF], guideline-directed medical therapy [GDMT], and percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]).

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines on arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting [^c5368454]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Comparative outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus CABG — in candidates for either approach, older randomized trials did not show short-term mortality or myocardial infarction differences but consistently found more repeat revascularization after PCI; more recent propensity-matched registries showed improved survival with CABG, and favorable CABG outcomes were linked to more complete revascularization and long-term graft durability. Evidence states that older trials "failed to detect significant differences in short-term death and myocardial infarction (MI) rates, but they consistently observed higher rates of repeat revascularization after PCI compared with CABG", that "large registries that used propensity-matched analyses showed improved survival with CABG", and that favorable CABG results were attributed to "more complete revascularization, and improved long-term outcomes and graft patency".

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^4d1e5559]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Physician decision‐making in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is based on patient presentation, comorbidities, anatomic complexity, technical feasibility, operative risk (conditioned by local expertise), and expected survival and quality‐of‐life improvement. Complex CAD in patients with stable ischemic heart disease requiring revascularization should prompt Heart Team discussions on the pros and cons of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for each individual patient. Shared decision‐making is increasingly advocated in coronary revascularization guidelines, enabling patients to ultimately make decisions on the basis of their values, preferences, and lifestyle. Patient preferences can be readily adopted when the heart team judges that the optimal therapy is in equipoise. However, when scientific data suggest that one treatment modality is likely to result in better outcomes, patient preferences for the alternative therapy poses clinical and ethical challenges, depending on the strength of the evidence and the heart team's beliefs. A common real‐world example of this is when patients with complex multivessel CAD who have no contraindications to surgery prefer and choose the less invasive option of PCI over CABG, despite physician and heart team recommendations to the contrary.PCI may also be performed in other patients with complex CAD who are ineligible for CABG due to medical comorbidities. Registries typically do not capture all risk characteristics contributing to these decisions, including frailty, the availability of conduits, and quality of the distal coronary vessels for grafting. Both groups of patients (those who are eligible for but refuse CABG and those deemed ineligible for CABG) are not included in randomized trials comparing the safety and effectiveness of PCI and CABG.

While CABG ineligibility is known to predict poor outcomes after PCI, less is known about the prognosis of patients who are eligible and recommended for surgery but decline. Surgical ineligibility and patient preferences are not included in current appropriate use criteria (AUC) and can impact evaluation of hospital quality and procedural appropriateness, particularly in states with public reporting of outcomes. Furthermore, how these patients fare when compared with those with multivessel CAD undergoing PCI within the AUC framework is important to ascertain. As such, we sought to evaluate the outcomes of CABG‐eligible patients who refused heart team recommendations for surgical revascularization and subsequently underwent PCI. Additionally, we evaluated how these patients compared with those with surgical anatomy who were deemed ineligible for CABG and those who were appropriate for PCI.

### PCI and CABG for treating stable Coronary artery disease: JACC review topic of the week [^320cb205]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are considered revascularization procedures, but only CABG can prolong life in stable coronary artery disease. Thus, PCI and CABG mechanisms may differ. Viability and/or ischemia detection to guide revascularization have been unable to accurately predict treatment effects of CABG or PCI, questioning a revascularization mechanism for improving survival. By contrast, preventing myocardial infarction may save lives. However, the majority of infarcts are generated by non-flow-limiting stenoses, but PCI is solely focused on treating flow-limiting lesions. Thus, PCI cannot be expected to significantly limit new infarcts, but CABG may do so through providing flow distal to vessel occlusions. All comparisons of CABG to PCI or medical therapy that demonstrate survival effects with CABG also demonstrate infarct reduction. Thus, CABG may differ from PCI by providing "surgical collateralization", prolonging life by preventing myocardial infarctions. The evidence is reviewed here.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) utilization trends are summarized as follows: In the past two decades, the overall rate of CABG in North America has declined by more than 23%. In The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgical Database, isolated CABG procedures peaked in 1997 at 191,581 and declined to 146,947 by 2012. When adjusted for the growing adult US population, a nearly 38% decline from 2001 to 2008 is noted, from 1,742 to 1,081 CABG procedures per million adults per year; p < 0.001.

### Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting is the future: pro [^61faa0e4]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide. However, most CABG operations performed today are as invasive -apart from saphenous vein harvesting- as they were 50 years ago. While heart valve operations have become less invasive, CABG faces formidable challenges in doing so. Valve surgery requires a single surgical exposure to the valve intervened on, but less invasive CABG necessitates multiple surgical exposures to harvest internal thoracic artery conduits, source their inflow plus that of other grafts, and expose each coronary target to be grafted -including anterior, lateral, posterior, and inferior vessels. In this article, we rationalize why we believe that conventional CABG remains unduly invasive, associated with morbidity and prolonged recovery, and why less invasive CABG in its many forms, which we describe, represents a safe, practical, diffusible, and less invasive alternative to sternotomy CABG. Centers of excellence in coronary artery surgery should dedicate resources and expertise to developing high-quality, safe, durable, and advanced forms of lesser invasive CABG.

Regarding surgical interventions for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for CABG, ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines recommend to use an internal mammary artery, preferably the left, to bypass the left anterior descending when bypass of the left anterior descending is indicated to improve survival and reduce recurrent ischemic events in patients undergoing CABG.

### Impact of coronary angiography early after CABG for suspected postoperative myocardial ischemia [^17c59319]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Coronary bypass surgery is fundamental in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Its indication is mainly based on findings during coronary angiography and well defined by national and international guidelines. On contrast, the diagnosis of post−/perioperative myocardial ischemia is grounded on elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK), CK-MB or cardiac troponin I (cTNI) levels, and the elevation of these serum markers within the first 24 h are associated with increased intermediate- and long-term mortality. However, there are neither uniform recommendations with regard what to enzymes to analyze nor cut-off levels indicating a need for further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Likewise, discussion is controversial whether cTNI or CK-MB is more useful to identify perioperative myocardial infarction. Yet, repeat coronary angiography remains the gold standard to evaluate postoperative myocardial ischemia, its indication has been recently proposed in a algorithm of the ESC Joint Working Groups on Cardiovascular Surgery and the Cellular Biology of the Heart position paper. It allows to judge patency of bypass grafts or the presence of untreated native coronary vessels as there is a substantial overlap with patients without graft occlusion, meaning that the patency status in the individual cannot be reliably predicted from these noninvasive tests. Nevertheless, the usefulness of repeat angiography is still under debate as it not only augments costs of treatment and may prolong hospital stay, especially if no further consequences are drawn, but also exposes the patient to an additional risk. According to the German Society of Cardiology the mortality for coronary angiography is 0.4–0.7% if no coronary artery disease is present, and 3.7% in patients with acute coronary syndrome (Press release German Society of Cardiology 10/2014).

### 2021: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure [^e603d8c1]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

AATS expert consensus — definitions and scope for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and heart failure (HF) states that the focus is CABG in patients with ICM and HF, that ICM is defined as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by coronary artery disease (CAD), with or without clinical HF, and that unless otherwise specified, ICM refers to patients with a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. It notes that although some recommendations may be relevant to patients with CAD and LVEF > 35%, this document primarily focuses on patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 35%. It further specifies that the document does not address emergency surgical interventions in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, and that detailed assessment and treatment of patients who may benefit from advanced HF surgical therapies such as durable ventricular assist device (VAD) and cardiac transplantation is beyond its scope. The document's goal is to provide a practical framework for managing patients with ICM, including triggers for specialized HF care, preoperative optimization, surgical interventions, and other measures, and it provides general guidance based on available evidence and prevailing opinions regarding best practices.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery vs percutaneous interventions in coronary revascularization: a systematic review [^a7781471]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are the revascularization options for ischemic heart disease. However, the choice of the most appropriate revascularization modality is controversial in some patient subgroups.

Objective

To summarize the current evidence comparing the effectiveness of CABG surgery and PCI in patients with unprotected left main disease (ULMD, in which there is > 50% left main coronary stenosis without protective bypass grafts), multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, or left ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

Evidence Review

A search of OvidSP MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases between January 2007 and June 2013, limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis of trials and/or observational studies comparing CABG surgery with PCI was performed. Bibliographies of relevant studies were also searched. Mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE, defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization) were reported wherever possible.

Findings

Thirteen RCTs and 5 meta-analyses were included. CABG surgery should be recommended in patients with ULMD, multivessel CAD, or LVD, if the severity of coronary disease is deemed to be complex (SYNTAX > 22) due to lower cardiac events associated with CABG surgery. In cases in which coronary disease is less complex (SYNTAX ≤ 22) and/or the patient is a higher surgical risk, PCI should be considered. For patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD, CABG surgery should be recommended as standard therapy irrespective of the severity of coronary anatomy, given improved long-term survival and lower cardiac events (5-year MACCE, 18.7% for CABG surgery vs 26.6% for PCI; P = 0.005). Overall, the incidence of repeat revascularization is higher after PCI, whereas stroke is higher after CABG surgery. Current literature emphasizes the importance of a heart-team approach that should consider coronary anatomy, patient characteristics, and local expertise in revascularization options. Literature pertaining to revascularization options in LVD is scarce predominantly due to LVD being an exclusion factor in most studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Both CABG surgery and PCI are reasonable options for patients with advanced CAD. Patients with diabetes generally have better outcomes with CABG surgery than PCI. In cases of ULMD, multivessel CAD, or LVD, CABG surgery should be favored in patients with complex coronary lesions and anatomy and PCI in less complicated coronary disease or deemed a high surgical risk. A heart-team approach should evaluate coronary disease complexity, patient comorbidities, patient preferences, and local expertise.

### Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting is overutilized [^6bd8d794]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), developed to avoid the potential complications of cardiopulmonary bypass, remains a subject of debate. Studies have demonstrated that off-pump CABG is associated with higher rates of incomplete revascularization, inferior graft patency, and increased reintervention rates compared to on-pump CABG, leading to worse outcomes. The theoretical neuroprotective and renal-protective benefits associated with off-pump CABG have not been definitively proven, with stroke and renal failure rates similar to those of on-pump CABG in both short- and long-term follow-up. Off-pump CABG presents technical challenges, contributing to a steep learning curve, and its effectiveness is dependent on surgeon and center experience. Lower-volume centers and surgeons performing off-pump CABG have shown increased rates of mortality and reintervention. Despite the potential cost savings by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass, the need for repeat interventions and associated complications can lead to higher long-term healthcare costs. This paper advocates for a more selective use of off-pump CABG while maintaining on-pump CABG as the standard approach for patients with coronary artery disease.

### Invasive versus medically managed acute coronary syndromes with prior bypass (CABG-ACS): insights into the registry versus randomised trial populations [^92032421]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is standard of care for patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. However, occlusive disease of saphenous vein grafts is common within 10 years of surgery, meaning patients with prior CABG have a progressive longer-term risk of recurrent ischaemia, including angina and myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) and death. Given the large number of CABG recipients living globally, and their health complexities, including increasing age and multimorbidity, this represents an increasing healthcare challenge globally, not least because of rehospitalisation due to recurrent ischaemia. Chest pain is the most common reason for hospital admission in the UK and about 1 in 10–15 patients admitted to hospital with an acute non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) have a prior CABG.

Pivotal clinical trials comparing routine invasive management vs conservative non-invasive management in unstable coronary syndromes excluded patients with prior CABG (online supplemental table 1). Current guidelines recommend a routine early invasive strategy in higher risk NSTE-ACS patients. However, invasive management is performed less often in NSTE-ACS patients with prior CABG, probably because the risk:benefit balance is considered to be less favourable in these patients compared with those without prior CABG. Furthermore, when invasive management is performed, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is less likely in prior CABG patients, implying a lower likelihood of benefit with a routine invasive strategy. Real-world evidence implies clinical practice departs from the results of systematic reviews and guidelines, indicating physician and patient preferences for treatment options may be relevant. Overall, evidence is lacking to inform the validity of current guideline recommendations, in NSTE-ACS patients with prior CABG. This important subgroup of ACS patients remains comparatively understudied. Enrolment into randomised trials can be challenging, particularly when the intervention disrupts standard care. Enrolment of elderly patients may be challenging, sometimes leading to premature trial discontinuation.

We hypothesised that the clinical characteristics, treatment and health outcomes would differ between participants enrolled in a randomised controlled trial of routine invasive versus routine non-invasive management in NSTE-ACS patients with prior CABG, and participants enrolled in the registry due to physician and/or patient preference. We aimed to prospectively gather information on the trial and registry participants in order to gain contemporary information on the natural history and reasons for trial participation or not.

It is now half a century since the start of coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) with the first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following just over a decade later. The relative merits of PCI vs. CABG for stable coronary artery disease (stable-CAD) have continued to be debated ever since and have been the focus of around 20 randomized trials and numerous registry studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The aim of this review is to identify areas of agreement, disagreement, and uncertainties in the role of PCI and CABG in patients with stable-CAD.

### Critical appraisal of cardiology guidelines on revascularisation: clinical practice [^49c0947e]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines on revascularisation recommend selection of coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with complex and multivessel acute coronary syndrome. The recommendation of CABG as the preferred intervention is made in three of six situations where patients have multivessel disease. These include specifically patients with:
three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate to high CAD burden (multiple diffuse lesions, presence of chronic total occlusion (CTO) or high SYNTAX Score),
isolated left main stenosis,
left main stenosis and additional CAD with low CAD burden (one-vessel to two-vessel additional involvement and low SYNTAX Score).

PCI is ranked as a class IIa or class III/level B for all three of the above situations while CABG is ranked as a class I/level A or B in all three. The 2014 ESC guidelines make similar recommendations for patients with multivessel disease and intermediate to high CAD burden based on SYNTAX Score risk. These classifications suggest that CABG is a preferred intervention for these patients based on evidence defined in broad terms of the presence and number of studies available (table 1). Because research is not static and evidence is not absolute, a closer look at the recommendations cited evidence is warranted.

Evidence

The ACC and ESC Guideline rankings are based on the study findings from two major randomised controlled trials (RCTs): (1) the 5-year SYNTAX Trial and (2) the FREEDOM Trial. Other studies cited by the guidelines (Cardia, BARI, ARTS, MASS) pre-date the advancement of newer stents and/or are small and underpowered.

### Should patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting who present with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes undergo routine invasive angiography? [^5f69721c]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractPatients who have previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may present with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs). In this setting, guidelines recommend routine invasive angiography. However, patients with CABG were often excluded from key trials that informed contemporary guidelines and invasive angiography is known to be of higher risk in these patients. In this article, the authors review the evidence and propose a trial to address the question, "Should patients with prior CABG who present with NSTE-ACSs routinely undergo invasive angiography?"

### Percutaneous coronary angioplasty versus coronary artery bypass grafting in treatment of unprotected left main stenosis (NOBLE): a prospective, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^650aa230]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the standard treatment for revascularisation in patients with left main coronary artery disease, but use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for this indication is increasing. We aimed to compare PCI and CABG for treatment of left main coronary artery disease.

Methods

In this prospective, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients with left main coronary artery disease were enrolled in 36 centres in northern Europe and randomised 1:1 to treatment with PCI or CABG. Eligible patients had stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Exclusion criteria were ST-elevation myocardial infarction within 24 h, being considered too high risk for CABG or PCI, or expected survival of less than 1 year. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of all-cause mortality, non-procedural myocardial infarction, any repeat coronary revascularisation, and stroke. Non-inferiority of PCI to CABG required the lower end of the 95% CI not to exceed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·35 after up to 5 years of follow-up. The intention-to-treat principle was used in the analysis if not specified otherwise. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, number NCT01496651.

Findings

Between Dec 9, 2008, and Jan 21, 2015, 1201 patients were randomly assigned, 598 to PCI and 603 to CABG, and 592 in each group entered analysis by intention to treat. Kaplan-Meier 5 year estimates of MACCE were 29% for PCI (121 events) and 19% for CABG (81 events), HR 1·48 (95% CI 1·11–1·96), exceeding the limit for non-inferiority, and CABG was significantly better than PCI (p = 0·0066). As-treated estimates were 28% versus 19% (1·55, 1·18–2·04, p = 0·0015). Comparing PCI with CABG, 5 year estimates were 12% versus 9% (1·07, 0·67–1·72, p = 0·77) for all-cause mortality, 7% versus 2% (2·88, 1·40–5·90, p = 0·0040) for non-procedural myocardial infarction, 16% versus 10% (1·50, 1·04–2·17, p = 0·032) for any revascularisation, and 5% versus 2% (2·25, 0·93–5·48, p = 0·073) for stroke.

Interpretation

The findings of this study suggest that CABG might be better than PCI for treatment of left main stem coronary artery disease.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery remains the standard of care for patients with diabetes [^1ebeaabf]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are proven effective treatments of coronary artery disease (CAD), however, the optimal revascularization strategy remains unclear in certain patient subsets. The recently published "Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease (FREEDOM)" trial is a randomized study evaluating the use of CABG vs PCI in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease. The purpose of this editorial is to review the FREEDOM trial and the available literature guiding clinicians to make evidence-based decisions when treating diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease. The current evidence suggests that CABG should remain the standard of care for this patient population.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) performance measure PM-8 — use of the internal mammary artery (IMA) to bypass the left anterior descending (LAD) — defines the measure as the percentage of patients, age ≥ 18 y, with an indication for bypass of the LAD who receive an IMA graft, with the numerator the percentage of patients with an indication for bypass of the LAD who receive an IMA graft and the denominator patients age ≥ 18 y with an indication for bypass of the LAD. Denominator exclusions are patient refusal to have IMA graft and unusable internal mammary arteries, and denominator exceptions require documentation of a patient reason(s) (eg, patient refusal) or documentation of a medical reason(s) (eg, prior sternotomy or left thoracotomy, no LAD disease, LAD unable to accept a bypass or unable to be grafted, significant chest deformity, previous radiation to the chest, significant proximal left subclavian stenosis, upper extremity arteriovenous fistula in ipsilateral arm, previous cardiac surgery, emergency, or salvage CABG). The measurement period specifies period of care as the index procedure or hospitalization and period of observation as all cases accumulated over a 12-mo period, with sources of data including EHR data, administrative data/claims (inpatient or outpatient claims), and paper medical record. Attribution may be the individual practitioner or facility, and the care setting is inpatient. Notes specify that although the left IMA is preferable, use of the right IMA is acceptable if the left IMA is not a viable option, and the aligned guideline states, "In patients undergoing CABG, an IMA (preferably the left) should be used to bypass the LAD when bypass of the LAD is indicated to improve survival and reduce recurrent ischemic events.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines on arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting [^cb94d8d9]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons arterial conduit recommendations for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) state that internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) should be used to bypass the left anterior descending (LAD) artery when bypass of the LAD is indicated (COR I, LOE B). As an adjunct to left internal thoracic artery (LITA), a second arterial graft (right ITA or radial artery) should be considered in appropriate patients (COR IIa, LOE B), and use of bilateral ITAs (BITAs) should be considered in patients who do not have excessive risk of sternal complications (COR IIa, LOE B). To reduce the risk of sternal infection with BITA, skeletonized grafts should be considered (COR IIa, LOE B), smoking cessation is recommended (COR I, LOE C), glycemic control should be considered (COR IIa, LOE B), and enhanced sternal stabilization may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C). As an adjunct to LITA to LAD or in patients with inadequate LITA grafts, use of a radial artery (RA) graft is reasonable when grafting coronary targets with severe stenoses (COR IIa, LOE B), and when RA grafts are used, it is reasonable to use pharmacologic agents to reduce acute intraoperative and perioperative spasm (COR IIa, LOE C). The right gastroepiploic artery may be considered in patients with poor conduit options or as an adjunct to complete arterial revascularization (COR IIb, LOE B), and use of arterial grafts (specific targets, number, and type) should be a part of the discussion of the heart team in determining the optimal approach for each patient (COR I, LOE C).

### STICH3C: rationale and study protocol [^1197de6f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the recommended mode of revascularization in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction (iLVSD) and multivessel disease. However, contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes have improved with the integration of novel technologies and refinement of revascularization strategies, and PCI is often used in clinical practice in this population. There is a lack of evidence from randomized trials comparing contemporary state-of-the-art PCI versus CABG for the treatment of iLVSD and multivessel disease. This was the impetus for the STICH3C trial (Canadian CABG or PCI in Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy), described here.

Methods

The STICH3C trial is a prospective, unblinded, international, multicenter trial with an expected sample size of 754 participants from ≈45 centers. Patients with multivessel/left main coronary artery disease and iLVSD with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% considered by the local Heart Team appropriate for and amenable to revascularization by both modes of revascularization will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to state-of-the-art PCI or CABG.

Results

The primary end point is the composite of death from any cause, stroke, spontaneous myocardial infarction, urgent repeat revascularization, or heart failure readmission, summarized as a time-to-event outcome. The key hierarchical end point is time to death and frequency of hospitalizations for heart failure. The key safety outcome is a composite of major adverse events. Disease-specific quality-of-life and health economics measures will be compared between groups. Participants will be followed for a median of 5 years, with a minimum follow-up of 4 years.

Conclusions

STICH3C will directly inform patients, clinicians, and international practice guidelines about the efficacy and safety of CABG versus PCI in patients with iLVSD. The results will provide novel and broad evidence, including clinical events, health status, and economic assessments, to guide care for patients with iLVSD and severe coronary artery disease.

### Standardizing the definition and analysis methodology for complete coronary artery revascularization [^2757a509]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Guideline-based medical therapy is the foundation of treatment for individuals with coronary artery disease. However, revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting may be beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes, refractory symptoms, or in other specific scenarios (eg, left main disease and heart failure). While the goal of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting is to achieve complete revascularization, anatomical and ischemic definitions of complete revascularization and their methodology for assessment remain highly variable. Such lack of consensus invariably contributes to the absence of standardized approaches for invasive treatment of coronary artery disease. Herein, we propose a novel, comprehensive, yet pragmatic algorithm with both anatomical and ischemic parameters that aims to provide a systematic method to assess complete revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting in both clinical practice and clinical trials.

### IBU 600 MG… [^ee828682]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

IBU tablets are indicated for relief of mild to moderate pain. IBU tablets are also indicated for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of IBU tablets in children have not been conducted. CONTRAINDICATIONS IBU tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivityto ibuprofen. IBU tablets are contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. WARNINGSCARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTSCardiovascular Thrombotic Events. Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDsof up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of seriouscardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, andstroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease orrisk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk.

To minimize thepotential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with anNSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortestduration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for thedevelopment of such events, even in the absence of previous CVsymptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/orsymptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigatesthe increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associatedwith NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID doesincrease the risk of serious GI events. Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID forthe treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgeryfound an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Congestive Heart Failure and Edema Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs.

IBU tablets should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure. Gastrointestinal Effects
- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.

Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Advanced Renal Disease No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with IBU tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease.

### Standardizing the definition and analysis methodology for complete coronary artery revascularization [^b3a92e52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Guideline‐based medical therapy is the foundation of treatment for individuals with coronary artery disease. However, revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting may be beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes, refractory symptoms, or in other specific scenarios (eg, left main disease and heart failure). While the goal of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting is to achieve complete revascularization, anatomical and ischemic definitions of complete revascularization and their methodology for assessment remain highly variable. Such lack of consensus invariably contributes to the absence of standardized approaches for invasive treatment of coronary artery disease. Herein, we propose a novel, comprehensive, yet pragmatic algorithm with both anatomical and ischemic parameters that aims to provide a systematic method to assess complete revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting in both clinical practice and clinical trials.

### Percutaneous intervention versus coronary artery bypass graft surgery in left main coronary artery stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9da68276]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Left main coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with poor clinical outcomes; without revascularization, the 3-year mortality reaches 50%. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has been the standard treatment for patients with left main CAD for a long time. However, the past few decades have witnessed rapid advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including stent technology, adjunctive imaging support, and pharmacotherapy, which substantially changed the revascularization strategy for treating left main CAD. The most recent European and US guidelines made a recommendation with a Class II to I indication for PCI in left main CAD patients with low to intermediate anatomic complexity.

However, these guidelines were mainly based on midterm findings of the SYNTAX trial, the PRECOMBAT trial, and two other small trials, all of which were underpowered to determine the comparative safety and efficacy of PCI versus CABG, particularly for individual hard endpoints. In the last 3 years, long-term follow-up data of the PRECOMBAT and SYNTAX trials, the large-scale EXCEL (Evaluation of Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization; NCT01205776), the NOBLE (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting vs Drug Eluting Stent Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty in the Treatment of Unprotected Left Main Stenosis; NCT01496651) trials, and several large-scale adjusted registries were published. Notably, the EXCEL and NOBLE trials may be the last clinical trials randomizing patients with left main CAD to PCI or CABG. In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and matched observational studies to compare the long-term performance of PCI versus CABG in patients with left main CAD, and to determine whether the development of stents would affect these findings.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^9c253073]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — angina relief, return to work, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes are summarized. At 1 year, fewer patients reported angina with CABG compared with PCI across 6,528 patients in 10 randomized trials (14% versus 26%, P < 0.001). A systematic review of 23 randomized studies found angina relief at 1, 3, and 5 years was better for CABG; at 5 years, freedom from angina was 84% for CABG and 79% for PCI (P < 0.001). Return to work occurs earlier with PCI-treated patients compared with CABG, but at 3–5 months the rate is similar. Drug eluting stents (DES) compared with historic CABG controls were associated with better QoL at 1 year and similar QoL at 3 year follow-up. In the SYNTAX trial, CABG showed a small but significant reduction in angina frequency compared with DES at 6 and 12 months among those with frequent baseline angina, but not in those with less frequent symptoms. With long-term follow-up (e.g., > 5 years), differences in angina-free status between PCI and CABG tend to decrease. In left main or single vessel proximal left anterior descending artery disease, PCI (compared with CABG) produced similar QoL at 6–12 months but more frequent angina at 5 years.

### Drug-eluting stents and the use of percutaneous coronary intervention among patients with class I indications for coronary artery bypass surgery undergoing index revascularization: analysis from the NCDR (national cardiovascular data registry) [^9b9d4a35]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our purpose was to evaluate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) attempt rates in patients with class I indications for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery after the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES).

Background

In patients with severe, multivessel coronary disease, CABG has historically been recommended over PCI. Practice guidelines for CABG were last updated before the emergence of data on DES efficacy.

Methods

We analyzed 265,028 procedures from the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) meeting American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class I indications for surgical revascularization. Temporal trends in PCI attempt rates were analyzed during 3 consecutive time periods: pre-DES (before April 1, 2003), DES diffusion (April 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004), and DES (January 1, 2005 to September 30, 2006).

Results

The attempted rate of PCI in patients with class I indications for CABG increased over the 3 time periods (pre-DES: 29.4%, DES diffusion: 33.4%, and DES era: 34.7%, p < 0.001). In a hierarchical multivariable logistic model adjusting for patient and PCI site characteristics, PCI attempts were more likely in the DES compared with pre-DES era (odds ratio: 1.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.40 to 1.48) and the DES diffusion era (odds ratio: 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.23). PCI attempt rates increased in all 3 time periods, although the average rate of increase during the DES era was 0.6% per quarter compared with 0.3% per quarter for both the DES diffusion and the pre-DES eras (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

DES use in clinical practice was associated with a significant overall increase in PCI to treat patients with class I indications for CABG. Long-term follow-up of this cohort of patients is warranted.

### Revascularization in stable coronary artery disease [^96e7f3e9]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) centers on medication to prevent myocardial infarction and death. Many anti-anginal medications also have benefit for reducing symptoms, and have been proven to be effective against placebo control. Before effective preventive medications were available, patients with stable CAD often underwent revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), on the plausible assumption that these procedures would prevent adverse events and reduce symptoms. However, recent randomized controlled trials have cast doubt on these assumptions. Considering results from the recent ISCHEMIA trial, we discuss the evidence base that underpins revascularization for stable CAD in contemporary practice. We also focus on patient groups at high risk of myocardial infarction and death, for whom revascularization is often recommended. We outline the areas of uncertainty, unanswered research questions, and key areas of potential miscommunication in doctor-patient consultations.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In patients with prior CABG and recurrent myocardial ischemia undergoing PCI, compared with patients who received native artery PCI, those who received graft PCI had lower 2‐year revascularization risk, but higher 5‐year MI risk. However, 5‐year all‐cause death and MACCE were similar between graft PCI group and native artery PCI group.

Based on this findings, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines on myocardial revascularization conferred a Class I recommendation to the use of the RA for CABG. Because the evidence in support of the RA continues to grow stronger and stronger, it seems likely that when the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for myocardial revascularization will be published, the RA will have the same class of recommendation.

Background

Despite the advances in the last decades for treatment of ischemic heart disease, women continue to experience poorer prognosis than men. The cause is multifactorial, including biological factors, clinical delay in diagnosis and atypical presentation, among others. Given that currently there is a gap in knowledge regarding the optimal revascularization strategy in women, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the long-term outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the treatment of stable ischemic heart disease in women.

Primary PCI and emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) decision-making at hospitals without on-site surgery — recommendations state to avoid intervention in long, calcified or severely angulated target lesions at high-risk for PCI failure with TIMI grade 3 flow present during initial diagnostic angiography, lesions in other than the infarct artery (unless they appear to be flow-limiting in patients with hemodynamic instability or ongoing symptoms), lesions with TIMI grade 3 flow that are not amenable to stenting in patients with left main or three-vessel disease that will require coronary bypass surgery, and culprit lesions in more distal branches jeopardizing only a modest amount of myocardium where more proximal disease could be covered with stent deployment. The document also directs teams to transfer emergently for coronary bypass surgery patients with high-grade left main or three-vessel coronary disease with clinical or hemodynamic instability after successful or unsuccessful PCI of an occluded vessel and preferably with intra-aortic balloon pump support, or a failed or unstable PCI result and ongoing ischemia, with intra-aortic balloon pump support during transfer.

### Stable coronary artery disease: revascularisation and invasive strategies [^29d41317]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease is the most common clinical manifestation of ischaemic heart disease and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Myocardial revascularisation is a mainstay in the treatment of symptomatic patients or those with ischaemia-producing coronary lesions, and reduces ischaemia to a greater extent than medical treatment. Documentation of ischaemia and plaque burden is fundamental in the risk stratification of patients with stable coronary artery disease, and several invasive and non-invasive techniques are available (eg, fractional flow reserve or intravascular ultrasound) or being validated (eg, instantaneous wave-free ratio and optical coherence tomography). The use of new-generation drug-eluting stents and arterial conduits greatly improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). PCI is feasible, safe, and effective in many patients with stable coronary artery disease who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment. In patients with multivessel and left main coronary artery disease, the decision between PCI or CABG is guided by the local Heart Team (team of different cardiovascular specialists, including non-invasive and invasive cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons), who carefully judge the possible benefits and risks inherent to PCI and CABG. In specific subsets, such as patients with diabetes and advanced, multivessel coronary artery disease, CABG remains the standard of care in view of improved protection against recurrent ischaemic adverse events.

### Trends in characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing coronary revascularization in the United States, 2003–2016 [^2072ed79]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Data on the contemporary changes in risk profile and outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary bypass grafting (CABG) are limited.

Objective

To assess the contemporary trends in the characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing PCI or CABG in the United States.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used a national inpatient claims-based database to identify patients undergoing PCI or CABG from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from July 15 to October 4, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic characteristics, prevalence of risk factors, and clinical presentation divided into 3 eras (2003–2007, 2008–2012, and 2013–2016) and in-hospital mortality of PCI and CABG stratified by clinical indication.

Results

A total of 12 062 081 revascularization hospitalizations were identified: 8 687 338 PCIs (72.0%; mean [SD] patient age, 66.0 [10.8] years; 66.2% male) and 3 374 743 CABGs (28.0%; mean [SD] patient age, 64.5 [12.4] years; 72.1% male). The annual PCI volume decreased from 366 to 180 per 100 000 US adults and the annual CABG volume from 159 to 82 per 100 000 US adults. A temporal increase in the proportions of older, male, nonwhite, and lower-income patients and in the prevalence of atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic risk factors was found in both groups. The percentage of revascularization for myocardial infarction (MI) increased in the PCI group (22.8% to 53.1%) and in the CABG group (19.5% to 28.2%). Risk-adjusted mortality increased slightly after PCI for ST-segment elevation MI (4.9% to 5.3%; P < .001 for trend) and unstable angina or stable ischemic heart disease (0.8% to 1.0%; P < .001 for trend) but remained stable after PCI for non-ST-segment elevation MI (1.6% to 1.6%; P = 0.18 for trend). Risk-adjusted CABG morality markedly decreased in patients with MI (5.6% to 3.4% for all CABG and 4.8% to 3.0% for isolated CABG) and in those without MI (2.8% to 1.7% for all CABG and 2.1% to 1.2% for isolated CABG) (P < .001 for all).

Conclusions and Relevance

Significant changes were found in the characteristics of patients undergoing PCI and CABG in the United States between 2003 and 2016. Risk-adjusted mortality decreased significantly after CABG but not after PCI across all clinical indications.

### Revascularization strategy for left main coronary artery disease comparing percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting [^67c43104]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While evidence supporting CABG in LMCAD has not been consistent across individual outcomes and separate studies, several trends have been demonstrated in the literature. In both randomized control trials and observational studies, rates of MI and repeat revascularization following treatment for LMCAD commonly favor CABG compared to both PCI and medical therapy, especially over the mid to long term. Rates of mid to long-term mortality have either favored CABG or have been not significantly different. Despite strong evidence supporting CABG over PCI, PCI continues to be supported as a suitable alternative to CABG. For example, the EXCEL Trial is often cited as presenting non-inferior outcomes for PCI compared to CABG given that non-inferiority was identified for the primary outcome, even with the previously mentioned limitations. The secondary outcomes are often disregarded as differences in rates of death, ischemia-driven revascularization, and secondary composite were significantly in favor of CABG. Despite the evidence in support of CABG, whether for composite or individual outcomes, PCI is still commonly used in patients with LMCAD even in contemporary cohorts, as highlighted by this study. While CABG confers long-term benefits over PCI in patients with LMCAD, patients with increased surgical risk or limited life expectancy such as those with advanced age, significant comorbidities, or frailty may be at an elevated surgical risk or may not have a life expectancy that would allow for patients to benefit from the long-term superiority of CABG. These factors should be considered in the evaluation of patients with LMCAD as not all patients with this disease may be appropriate for surgical revascularization.

In addition to the described limitations of the literature, previous studies have also been limited due to either sample size or duration of follow-up. This investigation provides long-term follow-up with 14-year data from a real-world cohort and adjusted statistics demonstrating reduced rates of mortality, myocardial infarction, and required repeat revascularization with CABG compared to PCI. An additional strength of this study is the collection of data from a provincial database reducing the risk of readmissions or outcomes not being collected from peripheral sites, as is a potential risk in other locations where adverse outcomes may not be recorded if patients present to a hospital outside of their health maintenance organization. With these findings in mind, selection of revascularization strategies must be individualized to the patient taking into consideration their anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preference. A multidisciplinary Heart Team review is widely advocated for and ensures that the optimal intervention is pursued for each patient with LMCAD.

### Mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for coronary artery disease: a pooled analysis of individual patient data [^0dd46160]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Numerous randomised trials have compared coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with coronary artery disease. However, no studies have been powered to detect a difference in mortality between the revascularisation strategies.

Methods

We did a systematic review up to July 19, 2017, to identify randomised clinical trials comparing CABG with PCI using stents. Eligible studies included patients with multivessel or left main coronary artery disease who did not present with acute myocardial infarction, did PCI with stents (bare-metal or drug-eluting), and had more than 1 year of follow-up for all-cause mortality. In a collaborative, pooled analysis of individual patient data from the identified trials, we estimated all-cause mortality up to 5 years using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared PCI with CABG using a random-effects Cox proportional-hazards model stratified by trial. Consistency of treatment effect was explored in subgroup analyses, with subgroups defined according to baseline clinical and anatomical characteristics.

Findings

We included 11 randomised trials involving 11518 patients selected by heart teams who were assigned to PCI (n = 5753) or to CABG (n = 5765). 976 patients died over a mean follow-up of 3·8 years (SD 1·4). Mean Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score was 26·0 (SD 9·5), with 1798 (22·1%) of 8138 patients having a SYNTAX score of 33 or higher. 5 year all-cause mortality was 11·2% after PCI and 9·2% after CABG (hazard ratio [HR] 1·20, 95% CI 1·06–1·37; p = 0·0038). 5 year all-cause mortality was significantly different between the interventions in patients with multivessel disease (11·5% after PCI vs 8·9% after CABG; HR 1·28, 95% CI 1·09–1·49; p = 0·0019), including in those with diabetes (15·5% vs 10·0%; 1·48, 1·19–1·84; p = 0·0004), but not in those without diabetes (8·7% vs 8·0%; 1·08, 0·86–1·36; p = 0·49). SYNTAX score had a significant effect on the difference between the interventions in multivessel disease. 5 year all-cause mortality was similar between the interventions in patients with left main disease (10·7% after PCI vs 10·5% after CABG; 1·07, 0·87–1·33; p = 0·52), regardless of diabetes status and SYNTAX score.

Interpretation

CABG had a mortality benefit over PCI in patients with multivessel disease, particularly those with diabetes and higher coronary complexity. No benefit for CABG over PCI was seen in patients with left main disease. Longer follow-up is needed to better define mortality differences between the revascularisation strategies.

Funding

### Percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary-artery bypass grafting for severe coronary artery disease [^2ba0e836]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involving drug-eluting stents is increasingly used to treat complex coronary artery disease, although coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been the treatment of choice historically. Our trial compared PCI and CABG for treating patients with previously untreated three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (or both).

Methods

We randomly assigned 1800 patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease to undergo CABG or PCI (in a 1:1 ratio). For all these patients, the local cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist determined that equivalent anatomical revascularization could be achieved with either treatment. A noninferiority comparison of the two groups was performed for the primary end point — a major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (i.e., death from any cause, stroke, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization) during the 12-month period after randomization. Patients for whom only one of the two treatment options would be beneficial, because of anatomical features or clinical conditions, were entered into a parallel, nested CABG or PCI registry.

Results

Most of the preoperative characteristics were similar in the two groups. Rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 12 months were significantly higher in the PCI group (17.8%, vs. 12.4% for CABG; P = 0.002), in large part because of an increased rate of repeat revascularization (13.5% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001); as a result, the criterion for noninferiority was not met. At 12 months, the rates of death and myocardial infarction were similar between the two groups; stroke was significantly more likely to occur with CABG (2.2%, vs. 0.6% with PCI; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

CABG remains the standard of care for patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, since the use of CABG, as compared with PCI, resulted in lower rates of the combined end point of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 1 year.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with acute coronary syndromes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a current report from the north-rhine westphalia surgical myocardial infarction registry [^53702719]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although surgical revascularization for reperfusion therapy in ACS has been largely superseded by primary PCI, and the indication for coronary bypass surgery in ACS, especially in STEMIs, has also been pushed far into the background in the current ACS guidelines, not at least this surgical infarction registry shows that acute coronary artery bypass surgery remains an important treatment option in these different scenarios of ACS (1) with ongoing ischemia and large areas of jeopardized myocardium, if PCI cannot be performed; or (2) following successful PCI of the culprit lesion with a further indication for CABG surgery; or (3) where PCI was incomplete, not sufficient, or has even failed.

We and others clearly demonstrated that in elective CABG surgery, the patient outcome in terms of mortality and MACCE rate can be compromised by prior PCI procedures regarding short‐ but also long‐term prognosis. In this current era of PCI treatment and because 15% to 30% of PCI‐treated patients with coronary artery disease will furthermore require "post‐PCI" coronary revascularization, and nearly 20% of those will be referred to CABG surgery at some time after stenting, the number of "stent‐loaded" patients is likewise increasing and will probably further increase. The situation in patients with ACS is on the one hand different compared with the elective coronary artery disease treatment, but on the other hand, patients with severe or even end‐stage coronary artery disease with acute myocardial infarction primarily treated with PCI may still have a further indication for CABG surgery.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^52868d59]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients may prefer percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, despite heart team recommendations. The outcomes in such patients have not been examined. We sought to examine the results of PCI in patients who were recommended for but declined CABG.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients with stable ischemic heart disease and unprotected left main or 3‐vessel disease or Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score > 22 who underwent PCI after heart team review between 2013 and 2020 were included. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to heart team recommendations on the basis of appropriate use criteria: (1) PCI‐recommended; (2) CABG‐eligible but refused CABG (CABG‐refusal); and (3) CABG‐ineligible. The primary end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year. The study included 3687 patients undergoing PCI (PCI‐recommended, n = 1718 [46.6%]), CABG‐refusal (n = 1595 [43.3%]), and CABG‐ineligible (n = 374 [10.1%]). Clinical and procedural risk increased across the 3 groups, with the highest comorbidity burden in CABG‐ineligible patients. Composite events within 1 year after PCI occurred in 55 (4.1%), 91 (7.0%), and 41 (14.8%) of patients in the PCI‐recommended, CABG‐refusal, and CABG‐ineligible groups, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, the risk of the primary composite outcome was significantly higher in the CABG‐refusal (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67 [95% CI, 1.08–3.56]; P = 0.02) and CABG‐ineligible patients (HR, 3.26 [95% CI, 1.28–3.65]; P = 0.004) groups compared with the reference PCI‐recommended group, driven by increased death and stroke.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular event rates after PCI were significantly higher in patients with multivessel disease who declined or were ineligible for CABG. Our findings provide real‐world data to inform shared decision‐making discussions.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^a1ae50dd]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

PCI improves quality of life — patient selection and comparative outcomes: Quality of life (QoL) improvement after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is proportional to the severity of angina before PCI and adequacy of revascularization, and some co-morbidities limit QoL before and after PCI and may minimize any improvement in QoL resulting from PCI. QoL benefits of PCI over medical therapy decrease over time due to cross-over from medical therapy to PCI, the efficacy of optimal medical therapy, and restenosis or progression of atherosclerosis. QoL after PCI compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is better in the short-term (months), worse in the intermediate term (1–5 years), and probably similar in the long-term (> 5 years) due to bypass graft failure, progression of atherosclerosis in native vessels, and cross-over from PCI to CABG. Many stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) patients and physicians tend to overestimate the benefits of revascularization procedures and underestimate the safety and effectiveness of medical therapy, and when there is equipoise in the risks/benefits of medical therapy compared with PCI, the preferences of the fully informed patient should play a major role in treatment decisions.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^0a53944d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who underwent PCI were categorized into 3 distinct groups: (a) patients with multivessel disease recommended for PCI as per American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2012 appropriate use criteria recommendations (PCI‐recommended); (b) patients eligible and recommended for CABG who refused surgery despite Heart Team recommendation (CABG‐refusal); and (c) patients deemed ineligible for CABG by the heart team (CABG‐ineligible).

In general, patients without disqualifying clinical comorbidities or frailty were recommended for CABG if "surgical anatomy" was present, defined as 2‐vessel or 3‐vessel CAD with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, 3‐vessel CAD with SYNTAX‐I score > 22, or unprotected left main disease with SYNTAX‐I score > 32. PCI‐recommended criteria reflected societal guidelines criteria class I, IIa, and IIb recommendations in patients with multivessel or left main CAD as summarized in Table S1. These generally correlate with 2012 AUC criteria "appropriate" (generally acceptable and reasonable) or "uncertain" (may be acceptable and reasonable). Patients with prior CABG were included in the PCI‐recommended cohort given the equipoise in guidelines with regard to outcomes with PCI or repeat CABG in these patients. Patients in the PCI‐recommended cohort usually underwent ad hoc PCI following diagnostic catheterization if previous patient consent was achieved after general discussion of revascularization alternatives with the heart team. The CABG‐refusal group consisted of patients who declined surgical revascularization despite heart team recommendation and instead elected for multivessel PCI. Patient refusal of CABG was expressly documented in the hospital chart before PCI in all cases. The CABG‐ineligible group was composed of patients who underwent surgical consultation and were not considered suitable for CABG. Documented reasons for CABG ineligibility were further categorized according to a previously published taxonomy.

Data Collection

Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic findings were prospectively entered into standardized forms during the index hospitalization for the PCI. The SYNTAX‐I score was also calculated in all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization by the interventional cardiologist. PCI was performed according to standard techniques, and stent choice was per operator preference. Likewise, dual antiplatelet therapy choice and duration were based on treating physician preference. Patients were followed by clinic visit or telephone interviews by experienced research personnel including medical records review of recurrent hospitalizations up to 1 year after PCI. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for anonymized data collection.

### Stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention: incidence, pathogenesis, and outcomes [^1445cf71]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is a devastating complication of both coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In a recent survey of 3112 cardiac patients by Sun and colleagues, death or prolonged hospitalization and long‐term disability due to stroke was identified as the main concerns of patients undergoing invasive procedures. 1 Better understanding of the prevalence of stroke and its acute and long‐term sequelae by both physicians and patients may have important implications for the choice of a particular revascularization strategy.

Surgical revascularization carries a higher procedural risk of stroke than PCI. 2 However, CABG may offer better long‐term survival in certain subsets of patients. Advancements in surgical techniques, medical therapy optimization, and neurologic risk stratification as well as in stent technology and pharmacological treatment continue to improve outcomes, so comparisons are often generally outdated soon after guideline recommendations are made. This speed adds to the challenges that patients, who are likely to prefer a less invasive approach, and physicians need to deal with in their decision process.

In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the incidence, pathogenesis, and outcomes of stroke after CABG and PCI. Moreover, we provide strategies on how to reduce the risk of stroke with both types of revascularization and relevant potentially preventative measures for use in daily practice.

### For patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting and recurrent myocardial ischemia, percutaneous coronary intervention on bypass graft or native coronary artery? – A 5-year follow-up cohort study [^20248abc]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In patients with prior CABG, their native coronary arteries are probably not able to achieve complete revascularization by PCI, due to multi‐vessel lesions, diffuse severe stenosis coexisted calcification or CTO, and that is the reason they have to undergo CABG. When they suffer recurrent myocardial ischemia, most of them were recommended to optimize drug therapy first, mainly due to unfeasible re‐CABG or PCI technology. The technical challenges of secondary CABG surgery mainly include the origin of bypass graft, internal tissue adhesion, and anatomical structure changes. It was reported that the incidence of death, MI, perioperative complications were significantly increased, and clinical benefit was decreased in the re‐CABG patients, compared with the first‐time CABG patients. Very few patients receive secondary CABG. However, when optimal medication cannot able to control the symptoms of myocardial ischemia well, patients are re‐admitted and resorted to revascularization. And as a compromise, they receive partial revascularization by PCI to achieve some improvement in quality of life, even cardiac function. The progress of PCI technology and equipment plays a key role. It was reported that patients undergoing redo CABG were more complex and associated with worse clinical outcomes than those receiving PCI. The absolute survival benefit of successful CTO procedures was more pronounced in patients with previous CABG than in non‐CABG patients. Therefore, PCI gradually become the first choice on the basis of "technical" feasibility in patients with prior CABG and recurrent myocardial ischemia.

In this study, 87.4% of the patients had LAD lesions, and most of the lesions were type B2 or C. Only 7.5% of the patients had LM involved or TVD, lower than expected. Since the population we analyzed in this study was all patients with recurrent myocardial ischemia after CABG undergoing PCI, it is conceivable that they were patients who still had the opportunity for intervention. Patients who did not have the opportunity for intervention and chose to take medicine were not included in the analysis. Diabetes was present in 35.6% of patients with prior CABG in this study. These real‐world data reflected that treatment situation was reasonable and guideline‐followed. CABG was found superior to PCI in patients with multivessel disease and diabetes.CABG (with a LIMA to the LAD) is recommended in preference to PCI to reduce mortality and repeat revascularization, in patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD with the involvement of LAD, who are appropriate candidates for CABG.

### Invasive therapy versus conservative therapy for patients with stable coronary artery disease: an updated meta-analysis [^f8613205]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Benefits of revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been clearly established. Multiple trials 1, 2 have shown improved overall survival and reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with ACS. PCI leads to effective restoration of vessel patency, reduced re‐occlusion, and improved residual left ventricular function. This evidence culminated in revascularization for ACS becoming a class I indication as per 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guidelines on PCI 3 and 2018 ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularization. 4 On the contrary, benefits of revascularization in stable ischemic heart disease have remained a topic of debate and controversy. Several large clinical trials 5, 6, 7, 8 have not shown any clear difference in mortality between revascularization and conservative therapy arms. New evidence from long term outcomes of FAME‐2 9 trial has reported lower incidence of MI with PCI. 9 With publication of the results of the ISCHEMIA 10 trial and the 5 years follow‐up results of FAME‐2 9 trial, we sought to provide in this meta‐analysis a comprehensive and updated assessment of the role of coronary revascularization coupled with medical therapy compared to conservative medical therapy alone (conservative therapy from here‐on) in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting vs percutaneous coronary intervention and long-term mortality and morbidity in multivessel disease: meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of the arterial grafting and stenting era [^d2554471]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent trials of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for multivessel disease were not designed to detect a difference in mortality and therefore were underpowered for this outcome. Consequently, the comparative effects of these 2 revascularization methods on long-term mortality are still unclear. In the absence of solid evidence for mortality difference, PCI is oftentimes preferred over CABG in these patients, given its less invasive nature.

Objectives

To determine the comparative effects of CABG vs PCI on long-term mortality and morbidity by performing a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials of the current era that compared the 2 treatment techniques in patients with multivessel disease.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted for all randomized clinical trials directly comparing CABG with PCI.

Study Selection

To reflect current practice, we included randomized trials with 1 or more arterial grafts used in at least 90%, and 1 or more stents used in at least 70% of the cases that reported outcomes in patients with multivessel disease.

Data Extraction

Numbers of events at the longest possible follow-up and sample sizes were extracted.

Data Synthesis

A total of 6 randomized trials enrolling a total of 6055 patients were included, with a weighted average follow-up of 4.1 years. There was a significant reduction in total mortality with CABG compared with PCI (I2 = 0%; risk ratio [RR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62–0.86]) (P < .001). There were also significant reductions in myocardial infarction (I2 = 8.02%; RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.48–0.72]) (P < .001) and repeat revascularization (I2 = 75.6%; RR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.21–0.41]) (P < .001) with CABG. There was a trend toward excess strokes with CABG (I2 = 24.9%; RR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.99–1.86]), but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). For reduction in total mortality, there was no heterogeneity between trials that were limited to and not limited to patients with diabetes or whether stents were drug eluting or not. Owing to lack of individual patient-level data, additional subgroup analyses could not be performed.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with multivessel coronary disease, compared with PCI, CABG leads to an unequivocal reduction in long-term mortality and myocardial infarctions and to reductions in repeat revascularizations, regardless of whether patients are diabetic or not. These findings have implications for management of such patients.

7.2. Revascularization to reduce cardiovascular events in SIHD — In patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) appropriate for either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), revascularization is reasonable to lower the risk of cardiovascular events such as spontaneous MI, unplanned urgent revascularizations, or cardiac death, with category of recommendation 2a and level of evidence B-R.

The ISCHEMIA trial randomized patients with SIHD and moderate-to-severe ischemia to an initial invasive versus conservative strategy, excluded left main disease and ejection fraction < 35%, and found the invasive strategy including revascularization with PCI or CABG was not associated with improved outcomes compared with medical therapy alone.

Discussion

AUC were developed to inform and guide the rational and judicious use of revascularization procedures and are widely used to evaluate overall clinical practice patterns. However, patient as well as physician preferences affect decision‐making with regard to the choice of revascularization, contributing to wide variation in PCI versus CABG use across centers and countries. Prior studies have demonstrated that patients deemed ineligible for CABG have high‐risk comorbidity and anatomic profiles that contribute to increased death and reduced event‐free survival after PCI. However, to our knowledge, no prior study has examined the risk profile and outcomes in CABG‐eligible patients in whom patient preferences dictated PCI. The present study thus examined the 1‐year outcomes following PCI in patients eligible and ineligible for CABG. Compared with a patient population with at least moderately complex CAD undergoing PCI as considered appropriate for PCI per the AUC and local heart team evaluation, there was an increased risk of cardiovascular events, in particular all‐cause death and stroke, in the CABG‐refusal and CABG‐ineligible patient populations at 1 year following PCI, even after accounting for the increased burden of comorbidities and extent and complexity of CAD. In general, the prognosis was worst in the CABG‐ineligible cohort, intermediate in the CABG‐refusal cohort, and best in the PCI‐recommended cohort. There were no differences between groups in the adjusted risks of MI, TVR, or bleeding. These data may be useful for the heart team to inform patients as to the prognostic risks of PCI in these settings. Based on these findings, future studies are warranted as to how to best integrate patient preferences and surgical ineligibility in AUC guidelines and risk calculators for more accurate risk appraisal and guidance of procedural appropriateness, risk, and comparative effectiveness.

### Mortality after drug-eluting stents vs. coronary artery bypass grafting for left main coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cd9ba2a9]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The optimal method of revascularization for patients with left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is controversial. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has traditionally been considered the gold standard therapy, although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being increasingly performed. Based on the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing CABG and PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), the 2018 European Guidelines and 2017 US appropriate use criteria recommended PCI as an appropriate alternative to CABG in patients with LMCAD and low-to-intermediate anatomical complexity. However, given sample size considerations, all prior trials have relied on composite outcomes as their primary endpoints and were under-powered for important low-frequency endpoints, such as death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, long-term follow-up (5–10 years) has now been performed for most of these trials. We, therefore, performed a systematic review and up-to-date meta-analysis comparing CABG vs. PCI with DES for the treatment of LMCAD, including for the first time the long-term follow-up from EXCEL, NOBLE, and SYNTAX, and focusing on individual clinical endpoints.

### Treatment of left main disease: let the patient choose [^754f7d66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The choice between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for the treatment of left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease has been debated for over a decade. When tackling the controversy, we need to take into account the heterogeneity of the disease, that is, location (ostial, body, or bifurcation), with or without involvement of the coronary tree, with or without diabetes mellitus, young versus elderly, and men versus women. Further, the lack of uniformity of end points across trials makes it difficult to pool studies together for meta‐analyses. The 2 largest published randomized trials with 5‐year follow‐up data showed conflicting results. The EXCEL(Evaluation of XIENCE Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial (N = 1905) demonstrated that at 5 years, both PCI and CABG had similar incidence of the primary composite end point (all‐cause death, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke). In contrast, the NOBLE (Nordic–Baltic–British Left Main Revascularisation) trial(N = 1201) demonstrated superiority of CABG over PCI for the primary composite end point of all‐cause death, nonprocedural MI, repeated revascularization, and stroke at 5 years. These results are mainly driven by the differences in MI and repeat revascularization rates in both groups. Importantly, all‐cause mortality was higher in the PCI group versus the CABG group in the EXCEL trial (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03–1.85), with no differences noted in cardiovascular mortality (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.85–1.85).

Recommendation-specific supportive text — mortality effects and subgroup signals: Although earlier studies suggested benefit, the text states that many recent studies and meta-analyses show an overall null effect of revascularization on all-cause death for CCD; contemporary medical-therapy mortality is lower (annualized 4.0% in CAME-2, 1.0% in FAME-2, and 1.6% in ISCHEMIA), and many trials had high crossover and low angiographic complexity. It specifies subgroups with mortality benefit of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) over guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) alone — multivessel disease with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 35%) and left main disease — and reports that STICH showed improved survival at 10 years for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (≤ 35%) treated with CABG plus optimal medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. In contrast, REVIVED-BCIS 2 found that PCI among patients with ejection fraction ≤ 35% did not improve major adverse cardiovascular events (including survival) at a median follow-up of 3.4 years. For left main disease, no recent trials compare revascularization to GDMT alone and most contemporary CCD trials excluded left main disease, so supporting evidence derives mainly from older randomized controlled trials.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) recommends the following: in patients who develop clinical ISR for whom repeat PCI is planned, a drug-eluting stent (DES) should be used to improve outcomes if anatomic factors are appropriate and the patient is able to comply with DAPT (Class 1, Level A); in patients with symptomatic recurrent diffuse ISR with an indication for revascularization, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be useful over repeat PCI to reduce recurrent events (Class 2a, Level C-EO); and in patients who develop recurrent ISR, brachytherapy may be considered to improve symptoms (Class 2b, Level B-NR). Context notes that newer-generation DES have reduced the risk of ISR compared with bare-metal stents and first-generation DES, yet ISR is still reported in 5% to 10% of patients undergoing PCI, and compared with other therapies, DES appears to provide the most benefit.
