## Question

A 24-year-old man, an information technology professional, gets himself tested for serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels because he wants to know more about his immunity. He knows that IgM levels reflect the status of his immunity, based on the internet. Although the laboratory report is normal, he consults a physician. The physician discusses human immunity and its important components. He also tells him that most circulating IgM antibodies in the blood of normal persons are produced by a specific type of B cell, which is present mostly in the peritoneal cavity and in mucosal tissues. He also mentions that these cells are components of innate immunity. Which of the following types of B cells is the physician referring to?
A. B-1 B cells
B. Follicular B cells
C. Memory B cells
D. Naïve B cells

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which B-cell subset is responsible for producing most of the circulating IgM in healthy individuals, is mainly found in the peritoneal cavity and mucosal tissues, and acts as a component of innate immunity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key phenotypic clues in the vignette. Then, I should verify which B-cell subsets map to those anatomical niches and functional properties. Next, I will compare the candidate options against the canonical B-cell subsets. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies between mouse and human data and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the core clues from the physician's description: the cells are enriched in the peritoneal cavity and mucosal tissues, they are innate-like, and they are the principal source of baseline circulating IgM in normal persons. I need to ensure I keep these three anchors in mind as I evaluate each option.

> Now, I will examine Option A, B-1 B cells. Wait, let me verify their anatomy and function before concluding. Multiple sources describe B-1 cells as innate-like B cells enriched in peritoneal and pleural cavities and mucosal sites, with a developmental origin distinct from conventional B-2 cells, and they are the main producers of natural IgM that circulates at baseline in mice; in humans, a CD19+CD27+CD43+ population has been proposed as a functional counterpart, though the human main source of natural IgM is often cited as marginal zone B cells, which I should reconcile shortly [^116CKdWR] [^111xWUZA] [^113Dtax1].

> Next, I should review Option B, follicular B cells. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Follicular B cells are classic adaptive B-2 cells that mature in bone marrow and spleen, localize to lymphoid follicles near T-cell zones, and typically require T-cell help for germinal center responses and class switching. They are not described as enriched in peritoneal or mucosal cavities nor as innate-like, so they do not fit the physician's description of the niche or innate function [^116CKdWR] [^111xWUZA].

> I will now examine Option C, memory B cells. Let me think about this carefully. Memory B cells are antigen-experienced adaptive cells that arise after immune priming, circulate widely, and can rapidly differentiate into plasma cells upon re-exposure. They are not characterized as a peritoneal- or mucosa-enriched innate subset, nor are they the primary source of baseline circulating IgM in unimmunized individuals, so this option conflicts with the innate, niche-specific clues provided [^116CKdWR] [^111xWUZA].

> Next, I should review Option D, naïve B cells. Hmm, wait a minute, naïve B cells are unprimed adaptive B-2 cells that circulate through secondary lymphoid organs and require antigen encounter and T-cell help for full activation. They are not described as an innate-like population enriched in peritoneal or mucosal tissues, nor as the main source of baseline circulating IgM, so this option also mismatches the vignette's descriptors [^116CKdWR] [^111xWUZA].

> Hold on, I should verify the apparent discrepancy about the human source of natural IgM. Initially, I almost concluded that marginal zone B cells are the main human source of natural IgM, which would seem to undermine B-1 as the answer; but wait, the question is anchored to the physician's description of a peritoneal/mucosal, innate-like subset, and that anatomical and functional profile aligns uniquely with B-1 cells even though human MZ B cells also contribute to natural IgM; importantly, the physician's teaching moment emphasizes the peritoneal/mucosal innate B-cell compartment, which best matches B-1 biology in both mice and the proposed human counterpart, so the most faithful answer here remains B-1 B cells despite the human MZ contribution caveat [^113Dtax1] [^116CKdWR] [^111xWUZA].

> Let me reconsider the full match to ensure nothing is missing. The physician's description of a B-cell subset enriched in peritoneal and mucosal sites, functioning as innate immunity, and producing most of the baseline circulating IgM maps directly to B-1 cells; follicular, memory, and naïve B cells are all conventional adaptive B-2 subsets that do not occupy that niche or innate role, reinforcing that the correct choice is B-1 B cells [^111xWUZA] [^113Ziokj].

> Final answer: A. B-1 B cells.

---

The correct answer is **B-1 B cells** [^116CKdWR]. These innate-like B cells are enriched in the peritoneal and pleural cavities and mucosal tissues [^111xWUZA], where they produce **natural IgM antibodies** that circulate in healthy individuals [^113Dtax1]. B-1 B cells are part of the innate immune system [^116CKdWR], providing rapid, T-independent responses and early defense against pathogens [^115z7DtW].

---

## Anatomical location and characteristics of B-1 B cells

B-1 B cells are **primarily located in the peritoneal and pleural cavities** [^113Ziokj] and mucosal tissues, including the gut and respiratory tract [^111xWUZA]. They are **innate-like B cells** [^116CKdWR] that produce natural antibodies — predominantly IgM — that circulate in healthy individuals [^113Dtax1]. These antibodies are polyreactive, binding multiple antigens with low affinity, and provide early defense against pathogens [^113Dtax1].

---

## Functional role of B-1 B cells in immunity

B-1 B cells are integral to the innate immune system, providing **rapid, T-independent responses** to pathogens [^116CKdWR]. Their natural IgM antibodies are critical for early defense, complement activation, and clearance of apoptotic cells [^113Dtax1]. B-1 B cells also contribute to mucosal immunity by producing IgM and IgA that help maintain barrier integrity and prevent pathogen invasion [^113Ziokj].

---

## Comparison with other B cell subsets

| **B cell subset** | **Location** | **Function** | **Antibody production** |
|-|-|-|-|
| B-1 B cells | Peritoneal and pleural cavities, mucosal tissues | Innate-like, T-independent responses | Natural IgM antibodies |
| Follicular B cells | Secondary lymphoid organs | Adaptive immune responses, germinal center formation | High-affinity IgG, IgA, IgE |
| Memory B cells | Circulation, secondary lymphoid organs | Long-term immunity, rapid recall responses | High-affinity IgG, IgA, IgM |
| Naïve B cells | Circulation, secondary lymphoid organs | Ready to respond to new antigens | None until activated |

---

B-1 B cells are **distinct from other B cell subsets** in their anatomical location, functional role, and antibody production [^116CKdWR]. Unlike follicular, memory, and naïve B cells, B-1 B cells are part of the innate immune system and produce natural IgM antibodies without prior antigen exposure [^113Dtax1].

---

## Clinical significance of B-1 B cells

B-1 B cells are **clinically significant** because they produce natural antibodies that provide early defense against infections [^113Dtax1]. Their dysfunction or depletion can impair innate immunity and increase susceptibility to infections, particularly at mucosal surfaces [^1146e4Uz]. Understanding B-1 B cells is essential for comprehending early immune responses and developing strategies to enhance innate immunity [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The physician is referring to **B-1 B cells**, which are innate-like B cells enriched in the peritoneal and pleural cavities and mucosal tissues [^113Ziokj]. They produce natural IgM antibodies that circulate in healthy individuals, providing early defense against pathogens and contributing to mucosal immunity [^113Dtax1].

## References

### The mucosal immune system and its integration with the mammary glands [^11223eg1]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Mucosal immunity reduces the need for elimination of penetrating exogenous antigens by proinflammatory systemic immunity. The adult gut mucosa contains some 80% of the body's activated B cells-differentiated to plasmablasts and plasma cells (PCs). Most mucosal PCs produce dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA), which, along with pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM), can be exported by secretory epithelia expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. Immune exclusion of antigens is performed mainly by secretory IgA in cooperation with innate defenses, but, in newborns and in IgA deficiency, secretory IgM is important. In the gut, induction and regulation of mucosal immunity occurs primarily in gut-associated lymphoid tissue-particularly the Peyer's patches-and also in mesenteric lymph nodes. Terminal differentiation to PCs is accomplished in the lamina propria to which the activated memory/effector T and B cells home. Lactating mammary glands are part of the secretory immune system, and IgA antibodies in breast milk reflect antigenic stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue such as the tonsils. Breast-milk antibodies are thus highly targeted against infectious agents and other exogenous antigens in the mother's environment, which are those likely to be encountered by the infant. Therefore breast-feeding represents an ingenious immunologic integration of mother and child.

### Designing screens: how to make your hits a hit [^113gf1JU]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

The basic goal of small-molecule screening is the identification of chemically 'interesting' starting points for elaboration towards a drug. A number of innovative approaches for pursuing this goal have evolved, and the right approach is dictated by the target class being pursued and the capabilities of the organization involved. A recent trend in high-throughput screening has been to place less emphasis on the number of data points that can be produced, and to focus instead on the quality of the data obtained. Several computational and technological advances have aided in the selection of compounds for screening and widened the variety of assay formats available for screening. The effect on the efficiency of the screening process is discussed.

### B cell contribution to immunometabolic dysfunction and impaired immune responses in obesity [^111xWUZA]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Box 2. B cell development and differentiation pathways

The stage of B cell development and mode of activation shaped by the immune context impacts the magnitude and quality of the overall B cell response. B cells egress from the bone marrow as transitional B cells, which migrate to the spleen to give rise to naïve mature B cells, which participate in immune responses. In canonical immune responses following antigen encounter, naïve B cell activation progresses through both the germinal centre (GC) and the EF pathways — each with a different output. Plasma cells produce antibodies maintaining baseline protection, while memory B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting cells after repeated pathogen exposure. In EF responses, double-negative (DN) (IgD - CD27 -) B cells are the proposed intermediate between naïve B cells and the EF plasmablasts, and as such they can be viewed as 'EF memory' B cells.

The GC reaction leads to delayed high-affinity, long-lived antibody production and the EF response gives rise to early, low-affinity antibodies. While somatically hypermutated, affinity matured immunoglobulins and memory B cells can be generated through both pathways, the EF response is considered largely T-independent (TI) and not to sustain long-term immune memory. Of note, in T-dependent (TD) responses B cells require CD4 + T cell help for antibody production, while in TI responses B cells can generate an antibody response without CD4 + T cell help.

In mice, B cells are divided into two main ontogenically different populations: B-1 and B-2 cells. In contrast to B-2 cells, which are enriched in secondary lymphoid organs, B-1 are enriched at mucosal sites, the omentum, peritoneal and pleural cavities, but are also found in the spleen. They are polyreactive with restricted specificity, predominantly IgM-expressing (low rates of class-switching to other antibody isotypes) and produce 'natural' immunoglobulins, which arise without immune exposure or vaccination. Epitopes often recognized by B-1 cells are conserved patterns expressed on invading pathogens and dying cells. In the absence of infection, they are considered protective due to their involvement in the clearance of host antigens. In humans, CD19 + CD27 + CD43 + B cells have been suggested to represent the functional counterparts to murine B-1 B cells, however, this remains contentious; others have proposed that these CD19 + CD27 + CD43 + cells represent an early antibody-secreting cell population rather than a B-1 cell functional equivalent.

### The function of immunoglobulin A in immunity [^113WS48A]. The Journal of Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

The vast surfaces of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts represent major sites of potential attack by invading micro-organisms. Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the principal antibody class in the secretions that bathe these mucosal surfaces, acts as an important first line of defence. IgA, also an important serum immunoglobulin, mediates a variety of protective functions through interaction with specific receptors and immune mediators. The importance of such protection is underlined by the fact that certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to compromise IgA-mediated defence, providing an opportunity for more effective invasion. IgA function may also be perturbed in certain disease states, some of which are characterized by deposition of IgA in specific tissues. This review details current understanding of the roles played by IgA in both health and disease.

### The current status and future direction of percutaneous coronary intervention without on-site surgical backup: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^113HKb3V]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Medium credibility.

Program structure and patient selection for PCI without on-site surgery include access expectations and volume timelines. A program without on-site surgery to perform only elective procedures or not provide availability to primary PCI 24 hr/day may exist in other countries and be appropriate. New programs should have 2 years to reach the absolute minimum volume, but after that programs failing to reach this volume for 2 consecutive years should not remain open under any circumstance. Rigorous clinical and angiographic selection criteria are essential for programs performing PCI without on-site surgery, and since the clinical situation and risk-to-benefit ratio are different for primary versus elective PCI, different criteria and standards should apply.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer continuous glucose monitoring to pregnant patients with T1DM. Consider obtaining real-time continuous glucose monitoring to reduce the risk for large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnancy complicated by T1DM, in conjunction with aims to achieve traditional pre- and postprandial glycemic goals.

### Eosinophils: important players in humoral immunity [^1164dQgh]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Eosinophils perform numerous tasks. They are involved in inflammatory reactions associated with innate immune defence against parasitic infections and are also involved in pathological processes in response to allergens. Recently, however, it has become clear that eosinophils also play crucial non-inflammatory roles in the generation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. Eosinophils, being a major source of the plasma cell survival factor APRIL (activation and proliferation-induced ligand), are essential not only for the long-term survival of plasma cells in the bone marrow, but also for the maintenance of these cells in the lamina propria which underlies the gut epithelium. At steady state under non-inflammatory conditions eosinophils are resident cells of the gastrointestinal tract, although only few are present in the major organized lymphoid tissue of the gut - the Peyer's patches (PP). Surprisingly, however, lack of eosinophils abolishes efficient class-switching of B cells to immunoglobulin (Ig)A in the germinal centres of PP. Thus, eosinophils are required to generate and to maintain mucosal IgA plasma cells, and as a consequence their absence leads to a marked reduction of IgA both in serum and in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Eosinophils thus have an essential part in long-term humoral immune protection, as they are crucial for the longevity of antibody-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow and, in addition, for gut immune homeostasis.

### Regulation of humoral and cellular gut immunity by lamina propria dendritic cells expressing toll-like receptor 5 [^113ToYGP]. Nature Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

The intestinal cell types responsible for defense against pathogenic organisms remain incompletely characterized. Here we identify a subset of CD11c(hi)CD11b(hi) lamina propria dendritic cells (LPDCs) that expressed Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in the small intestine. When stimulated by the TLR5 ligand flagellin, TLR5(+) LPDCs induced the differentiation of naive B cells into immunoglobulin A-producing plasma cells by a mechanism independent of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In addition, by a mechanism dependent on TLR5 stimulation, these LPDCs promoted the differentiation of antigen-specific interleukin 17-producing T helper cells and type 1 T helper cells. Unlike spleen DCs, the LPDCs specifically produced retinoic acid, which, in a dose-dependent way, supported the generation and retention of immunoglobulin A-producing cells in the lamina propria and positively regulated the differentiation interleukin 17-producing T helper cells. Our findings demonstrate unique properties of LPDCs and the importance of TLR5 for adaptive immunity in the intestine.

### The peritoneal micromilieu commits B cells to home to body cavities and the small intestine [^11231yva]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The distinct combination of homing receptors such as selectins, chemokine receptors, and integrins directs the migration of lymphocytes throughout the body. Upon activation lymphocytes irreversibly switch their set of homing receptors, now guiding them to entirely different destinations. Here we report that exposure of naive B cells to the microenvironment of the peritoneal cavity modulates their migration propensities in the absence of antigenic stimulation. B1 and B2 cells isolated from the peritoneal cavity reenter this compartment more efficiently compared with splenic follicular B cells. Moreover, when kept in the peritoneal cavity splenic follicular B cells gain such increased capability to reenter this compartment. These altered migratory capacities are reflected by an up-regulation of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5 and beta7 integrin by the peritoneum-experienced splenic B cells, among which CXCR5 is instrumental in directing B cells into the peritoneal cavity. Moreover, intraperitoneal transfer of plasma blasts favors their migration into the small intestine presumably before class switch recombination occurs, demonstrating that a reconfigured transient migration pattern is not restricted to naive cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized role for tissue-specific cues, altering the migratory capacity of B1, naive B2, as well as antigen-experienced B2 cells.

### MAIT cells are enriched and highly functional in ascites of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis [^112wCSX4]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Patients with advanced liver cirrhosis have an increased susceptibility to infections. As part of the cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which have the capacity to respond to bacteria, are severely diminished in circulation and liver tissue. However, MAIT cell presence and function in the peritoneal cavity, a common anatomical site for infections in cirrhosis, remain elusive. In this study, we deliver a comprehensive investigation of the immune compartment present in ascites of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and focus especially on MAIT cells.

Approach and Results

To study this, matched peripheral blood and ascites fluid were collected from 35 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, with or without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). MAIT cell phenotype and function were analyzed using high-dimensional flow cytometry, and the obtained data were compared with the blood samples of healthy controls (n = 24) and patients with compensated cirrhosis (n = 11). We found circulating MAIT cells to be severely decreased in patients with cirrhosis as compared with controls. In contrast, in ascites fluid, MAIT cells were significantly increased together with CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells. This was paralleled by elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ascites fluid as compared with plasma. Peritoneal MAIT cells displayed an activated tissue-resident phenotype, and this was corroborated by increased functional responses following stimulation with E. coli or interleukin (lL)-12 + IL-18 as compared with circulating MAIT cells. During SBP, peritoneal MAIT cell frequencies increased most among all major immune cell subsets, suggestive of active homing of MAIT cells to the site of infection.

Conclusions

Despite severely diminished MAIT cell numbers and impaired phenotype in circulation, peritoneal MAIT cells remain abundant, activated, and highly functional in decompensated cirrhosis and are further enriched in SBP. This suggests that peritoneal MAIT cells could be of interest for immune-intervention strategies in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and SBP.

### Cell barrier function of resident peritoneal macrophages in post-operative adhesions [^114PnjaN]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Peritoneal macrophages are classified into two major distinct subsets, the large peritoneal macrophage (LPM) and small peritoneal macrophage (SPM), basically according to their size. LPMs are the resident macrophages, which are dominant at the steady-state and maintained in the peritoneal cavity through self-renewal, and have an F4/80 High, CD11b High, MHCII Low, GATA6 High, and CD206 − phenotype. By contrast, SPMs are the recruited macrophages, which are derived from circulating monocytes and increase in number in response to an inflammatory stimulus in a CCR2 dependent manner. These cells exhibit an F4/80 Low, CD11b Low, MHCII High, GATA6 Low, and CD206 + phenotype. Sexually dimorphic replenishment of LPM by bone marrow-derived cells, which is high in males and very low in females, has also been reported. In addition, there is information available regarding the functional diversity of these subsets. For instance, LPMs regulate the peritoneal B-1 cell-mediated gut IgA production through TGFβ2 under the normal condition. SPMs have an ability to present antigens to naive CD4 + T cells, suggesting that SPMs induce local T-cell priming during peritoneal infection or inflammation. In our study, F4/80 High CD206 − and F4/80 Low CD206 + macrophage subsets exhibited comparable characters to LPMs and SPMs, respectively, in terms of morphology and gene/protein expression. However, further investigation is needed to define these macrophages as LPMs and SPMs.

### Blood dendritic cells interact with splenic marginal zone B cells to initiate T-independent immune responses [^115z7DtW]. Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

Marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B lymphocytes participate jointly in the early immune response against T-independent (TI) particulate antigens. Here we show that blood-derived neutrophil granulocytes and CD11c(lo) immature dendritic cells (DC) are the primary cells that efficiently capture and transport particulate bacteria to the spleen. In a systemic infection, CD11c(lo) DC, but not neutrophils, provide critical survival signals, which can be inhibited by TACI-Fc, to antigen-specific MZ B cells and promote their differentiation into IgM-secreting plasmablasts. In a local TI response, peritoneal cavity macrophages provide similar support to B1 B-derived Ag-specific blasts. In the absence of soluble TACI ligands, Ag-activated MZ- and B1-derived blasts lack survival signals and undergo apoptosis, resulting in severely impaired antibody responses.

### Omental milky spots develop in the absence of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells and support B and T cell responses to peritoneal antigens [^111U5fgJ]. Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

The omentum is a site of B1 cell lymphopoiesis and immune responsiveness to T cell-independent antigens. However, it is unknown whether it supports immune responses independently of conventional lymphoid organs. We showed that the omentum collected antigens and cells from the peritoneal cavity and supported T cell-dependent B cell responses, including isotype switching, somatic hypermutation, and limited affinity maturation, despite the lack of identifiable follicular dendritic cells. The omentum also supported CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to peritoneal antigens and recruited effector T cells primed in other locations. Unlike conventional lymphoid organs, milky spots in the omentum developed in the absence of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells, but required the chemokine CXCL13. Although the lymphoid architecture of milky spots was disrupted in lymphotoxin-deficient mice, normal architecture was restored by reconstitution with lymphotoxin-sufficient hematopoietic cells. These results indicate that the milky spots of the omentum function as unique secondary lymphoid organs that promote immunity to peritoneal antigens.

### Don't order immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody… [^111Kgiod]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

As the prevalence of a disease decreases, so does the positive predictive value for testing for acute infection with that disease. Although documentation of IgG antibodies to rare infectious agents is useful, assessing acute infection by evaluation of IgM antibody status to these agents is fraught with false positives and low predictive value. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rubella is no longer endemic in the United States. As such, nearly all positive rubella IgM antibody tests are false positives, resulting in unnecessary follow-up testing and unnecessary anxiety. Even for diseases not yet eradicated and for which low level outbreaks still occur, if overall prevalence remains low, then the predictive value of positive IgM serology will still be low.

False-positive measles IgM serology, for example, has been documented due to cross-reactivity to parvovirus and human herpes virus 6, among others. If clinical evaluation yields legitimate pretest suspicion for a rare infectious disease, then practitioners should report to and engage the help of their state public health department and/or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in further evaluating for potential acute infection. In common viral infections, it is also most effective to limit IgM serology to those cases in which clinical assessment yields relatively high suspicion for acute infection, since there are well-known causes for potential IgM antibody cross-reactivity. The potential for false-positive results will decrease with increasing pretest probability for true acute infection.

### Local and systemic innate immune response to secondary human peritonitis [^113ZFZpK]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Secondary peritonitis is responsible for an acute local and systemic innate immune response involving a simultaneous release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. The most severely affected patients had higher plasma levels of all cytokines but this difference was not observed with peritoneal fluid cytokines. A large gradient in cytokine concentration was noted between the peritoneal cavity and plasma, highlighting the importance of compartmentalization of innate immune response during peritonitis.

### Implications for induction of autoimmunity via activation of B-1 cells by Helicobacter pylori urease [^114dDnTF]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Besides various gastroduodenal diseases, Helicobacter pylori infection may be involved in autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Such autoimmune disorders are often associated with autoreactive antibodies produced by B-1 cells, a subpopulation of B lymphocytes. These B-1 cells are mainly located in the pleural cavity or mucosal compartment. The existence of H. pylori urease-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing B cells in the mucosal compartment and of their specific IgM in the sera of acutely infected volunteers suggests the possibility that urease stimulates mucosal innate immune responses. Here, we show for the first time that purified H. pylori urease predominantly stimulates the B-1-cell population rather than B-2 cells, which produce antigen-specific conventional antibodies among splenic B220(+) B cells. The fact that such stimulation of B-1 cells was not affected by the addition of polymyxin B indicates that the effect of purified H. pylori urease was not due to the contamination with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, the production of various B-1-cell-related autoreactive antibodies such as IgM-type rheumatoid factor, anti-single-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-phosphatidyl choline antibody was observed when the splenic B cells were stimulated with purified H. pylori urease in vitro. These findings suggest that H. pylori components, urease in particular, may be among the environmental triggers that initiate various autoimmune diseases via producing autoreactive antibodies through the activation of B-1 cells. The findings shown here offer important new insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders related to H. pylori infection.

### Recent progress in mucosal immunology and vaccine development [^115xusog]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

DCs are professional antigen-presenting cells that are found at various body sites, where they survey and process microorganisms. At mucosal interfaces, they are found in the lamina propria, subepithelium, T-cell zones of lymphoid tissue associated with the mucosa and draining lymph nodes. Mucosal DCs can control the suppressive regulation of commensal bacteria and innocuous antigens and protect the host against pathogens by generating various helper T cells (for example, Th1/Th2/Th17 cells), CD8 + T cells and SIgA antibodies. Among the mucosal DC subsets, CD103 + DCs play an indispensable role in T-cell differentiation, whereas CX3CR1 + DCs can sample and process both circulatory and gut luminal antigens. Gut CD103 + CD11b + DCs, TNF-α/iNOS-producing DCs (TipDCs) and TLR5 + DCs express retinaldehyde dehydrogenase and thus can be used for IgA class switching. It seems likely that the specific targeting of antigens in a vaccine to specified mucosal DC subsets could result in effective stimulation of T- and B-cell responses.

Because cutaneous and mucosal tissues are constantly exposed to exogenous antigens, each tissue has adopted various types of innate immune cells to facilitate immune surveillance. Mast cells in mucosal compartments (mucosal-type mast cells) are key players in the control of inflammatory, allergic and infectious diseases. In fact, treatment with activators that are specific for mast cells results in protective immunity against pathogens in mucosal compartments. Mucosal-type mast cells mainly produce histamine, proteases (for example, tryptase and chymase) and TNF-α, all of which may play crucial roles in protection, similar to the effect of an adjuvant. In addition, mucosal-type mast cells are involved in induction of SIgA by IL-6 and in physical interactions via CD40-CD40L. Conversely, downregulation of mast cell activation ameliorates symptoms related to gut allergies, pathogenic infection and inflammation.

### Serology in the 21st century: the molecular-level analysis of the serum antibody repertoire [^117LqJkV]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The ensemble of antibodies found in serum and secretions represents the key adaptive component of B-cell mediated humoral immunity. The antibody repertoire is shaped by the historical record of exposure to exogenous factors such as pathogens and vaccines, as well as by endogenous host-intrinsic factors such as genetics, self-antigens, and age. Thanks to very recent technology advancements it is now becoming possible to identify and quantify the individual antibodies comprising the serological repertoire. In parallel, the advent of high throughput methods for antigen and immunosignature discovery opens up unprecedented opportunities to transform our understanding of numerous key questions in adaptive humoral immunity, including the nature and dynamics of serological memory, the role of polyspecific antibodies in health and disease and how protective responses to infections or vaccine challenge arise. Additionally, these technologies also hold great promise for therapeutic antibody and biomarker discovery in a variety of settings.

### Recruited macrophages that colonize the post-inflammatory peritoneal niche convert into functionally divergent resident cells [^112VGvGp]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Our data also predict that inflammation-elicited LPM fail to express Cxcl13 due to inflammation-induced loss of requisite niche signals. Notably, Cxcl13 expression by LPM is sustained in vitro without addition of niche factors, potentially explaining why CXCL13 expression remains intact in incumbent LPM following mild inflammation. Hence, unlike the reversible program of gene expression controlled by GATA6 that is lost in the absence of RA, niche signals required to induce expression of CXCL13 in newly recruited macrophages may not be needed to maintain expression in resident cells.

Cxcl13 -deficient mice are profoundly deficient in peritoneal B1 cellsyet CXCL13 is not required for retention of B1 cells in the cavity. We found the extent of inflammation and consequently the ratio of CXCL13-producing resident macrophages to monocyte-derived CXCL13 - LPM in the cavity correlates with a failure to accumulate peritoneal B1 cell with age. As no other peritoneal lavage cells produce CXCL13, our data suggest CXCL13 production by peritoneal macrophages is required for continued recruitment of B1 cells from the circulation. Notably, replacement of peritoneal LPM by monocytes and concurrent failure to expand peritoneal B1 cells also occurs following abdominal surgery. Hence, long-term dysregulation of B1 cells is likely a general feature of peritoneal inflammation. Sterile peritoneal inflammation also led to elevated circulating natural antibody. Whereas splenic and bone marrow B1 cells spontaneously secrete high levels of natural IgM, those in the cavities do not. Furthermore, levels of serum anti-PC IgM gradually drop with age. Hence, we speculate that the failure to accumulate B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity may allow their re-entry into tissues permissive for antibody secretion such as fat associated lymphoid clusters.

### Innate signals in mucosal immunoglobulin class switching [^1153LLtq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The intestinal mucosa contains large communities of commensal bacteria that process otherwise indigestible food components, synthesize essential vitamins, stimulate the maturation of the immune system, and form an ecologic niche that prevents the growth of pathogenic species. Conversely, the intestine provides the commensals with a stable habitat rich in energy derived from the ingested food. A delicate homeostatic balance maintains this mutualistic relationship without triggering a destructive inflammatory response. Commensals orchestrate intestinal homeostasis by entertaining an intimate dialogue with epithelial cells and immune cells lodged in the mucosa. Such a dialogue generates finely tuned signaling programs that ensure a state of hyporesponsiveness against noninvasive commensals and a state of active readiness against invasive pathogens. In this dialogue epithelial cells function as "interpreters" that continuously translate microbial messages to "instruct" immune cells as to the antigenic composition of the intestinal lumen. This education process initiates sophisticated defensive strategies that comprise massive production of IgA, a noninflammatory mucosal antibody class that generates immunity while preserving homeostasis.

### Realising the potential of correlates of protection for vaccine development, licensure and use: short summary [^115Yg9gh]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Essential background

A correlate of protection is broadly defined as an immune marker predictive of protection against a specified clinical disease endpoint. Multiple immune mechanisms can be responsible for clinical protection including serum and mucosal B-cell-mediated responses (e.g. neutralising and binding antibodies, functional antibody responses, B-cell subsets, across different Ig classes – IgA, IgG, IgM), T-cell-mediated responses including memory responses (across multiple T-cell subsets), cytokines and other mediators (including those associated with T-cell or B-cell responses), and innate immune responses. The relevance and contribution of these mechanisms varies by pathogen. For some pathogens, such as poliovirus, antibodies are the main mediators of protection; less commonly, for example for varicella-zoster virus and shingles, cell-mediated immunity is the key protective mechanism. In many cases, multiple and potentially interdependent immune mechanisms likely contribute to protection. A further point to consider is that protective mechanisms, even if effective, can be overcome by high doses of infectious agent.

For each pathogen, mechanisms of protection may be different at different stages of infection and for different indications or endpoints. COVID-19 provides an example: Whilst there is no validated CoP for prevention from infection at mucosal surfaces, neutralising antibodies and T cells may provide protection in the upper airway, whereas protection in the lungs includes the role of binding antibodies through Fc, anamnestic antibodies and T cells, with the most severe outcomes of COVID-19 likely to require multiple branches of adaptive immunity acting synergistically. Correlates of protection may also differ between populations, for example because of past exposure to infections, or by age (e.g. efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in LMIC settings. Finally, for most pathogens, the concept of a protective threshold gives a misleading picture of the relationship between a biomarker and absence of illness. In reality, there is a continuous relationship between biomarker levels and degrees of clinical protection, rather than a 'cliff-edge'. New statistical approaches could enable regulators to move away from a threshold model towards one that better reflects this relationship.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody types and kinetics — diagnostic considerations note that there are 2 general types of antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and nonneutralizing (binding) antibodies, and commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests can measure single immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, or IgA) or total antibody and differentiate nAbs from binding antibodies. IgM antibodies are typically produced first after infection and are used as a measure of recent infection, whereas IgG antibodies generally develop later than IgM antibodies and remain elevated for months to years after infection. Although IgM antibodies can be detected within the first 2 weeks of symptoms in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unusual in that IgM and IgG more commonly rise together, more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

### Invasive fungal infections in patients with liver disease: immunological and clinical considerations for the intensive care unit [^114iCNJP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A component of the innate immune response that is also crucial for adaptive immunity to fungal infection is the dendritic cell (DC). DCs are among the professional phagocytes capable of neutralizing fungi on initial contact, but they ensure preservation of fungal peptides for their primary role as antigen presenting cells in lymphoid tissues. Importantly, DCs potentiate the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. Considered a type of innate lymphoid cell (ILC), this small lymphocyte subset (15% of the total population) has been increasingly appreciated as central to frontline fungal surveillance and elimination. In general, ILCs are local responders to mucosal damage found in abundance at sites such as the lung and intestine, the two most important portals of entry for IFIs. In murine models, ILCs that secrete IL-17 have been demonstrated to play a role in fungal control not only in mucosal but also in systemic candidiasis. Finally, the complement system — previously thought to be strictly an antibacterial arm of innate immunity — has recently been shown to contribute to protection against systemic Candida infection.

Adaptive immunity

The adaptive immune system consists of two parts: humoral and cellular. The central cell of the former is the B lymphocyte responsible for producing antibodies, which coat extracellular pathogens and thereby facilitate their clearance. The latter is mediated by CD4 + T lymphocytes (i.e. helper T cells) following antigen presentation by phagocytes, such as macrophages and DCs. The helper T cell population consists of multiple subtypes that vary according to their cytokine profile and thus the eventual effector cells they stimulate. Cell-mediated immunity is the more important adaptive arm for antifungal defenses. Specifically, the Th1 helper T cell response is characterized by the elaboration of, among other cytokines, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and TNF-α. This leads to activation of macrophages and CD8 + T lymphocytes (i.e. cytotoxic T cells), enabling them to eliminate infected cells more effectively. The Th1 pathway is also viewed as a form of protection against disseminated infection by fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus notable among them, that are capable of survival and proliferation within the macrophages they encounter as part of the innate immune response. The Th17 pathway, acting via IL-17A and IL-17F, plays a vital role in antifungal defense at the mucosal interface by recruiting neutrophils and by stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides that directly inhibit Candida. The importance of this pathway is supported by the clinical observation that inherited IL-17 receptor defects result in chronic mucocutaneous fungal syndromes.

### New insights into immune mechanisms of antiperlecan / LG3 antibody production: importance of T cells and innate B1 cells [^114Nxov2]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the present work, we show that exposure to the perlecan fragment LG3, even in the absence of adjuvant, leads to the production of anti‐LG3 antibodies. This relative ease in inducing immune response to LG3 is likely because of the presence of memory B cells, even prior to immunization, in the spleen, bone marrow but most strikingly in the peritoneal cavity of normal mice. We also found that B1 subsets within the peritoneal cavity are the main source of LG3‐specific memory B cells. Mouse B1 cells are the predominant constituents of peritoneal B cells and are also found in the pleural cavity, the spleen, and the bone marrow. 32, 33, 34, 35 In contrast to B2 cells, B1 cell development occurs primarily during fetal and perinatal life. B1 cells are effectors of the innate immune system and the main producers of polyreactive antibodies that bind to both microbial antigens and self‐antigens, including neo‐self epitopes expressed by apoptotic cells such as annexin IV and phosphorylcholine. 36, 37, 38 It has been suggested that natural autoantibodies produced by B1 cells favor the clearance of senescent and apoptotic cells and therefore have protective effector functions. 34, 39 We previously showed that LG3 is produced by apoptotic endothelial cells downstream of caspase‐3 activation and released through the production of exosome‐like apoptotic membrane vesicles. 40, 41, 42 The presence of a predominant B1 cell memory‐response to LG3 in naïve mice suggests that memory to LG3 is likely a normal and innate response to components of membrane vesicles released by apoptotic cells. Interactions between anti‐LG3 antibodies and LG3 present on apoptotic membrane vesicles could potentially help the organism clear remnants of apoptotic cells.

Giving your Injection:

Inject your NovoLog exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting.
NovoLog can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper arms, infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump), or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider.
If you inject NovoLog, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin.
If you use NovoLog in an insulin pump, you should change your infusion set and insertion site according to the manufacturer's user manual. NovoLog should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites. Do not insert into the exact same spot for each insertion. Do not insert where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not insert where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. The insulin in the reservoir should be changed at least every 7 days or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter, even if you have not used all of the insulin.
If you use NovoLog in an insulin pump, see your insulin pump manual for instructions or talk to your healthcare provider.
NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with NovoLog. Do not mix NovoLog with any other type of insulin.
NovoLog should only be mixed with NPH insulin if it is going to be injected right away under your skin (subcutaneously).
NovoLog should be drawn up into the syringe before you draw up your NPH insulin.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you are not sure about the right way to mix NovoLog and NPH insulin.

### Principles and strategies for step-by-step AVM excision [^117FxKca]. Neurosurgical Focus (2022). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are some of the most challenging surgical entities. Like any challenging surgical procedure, AVM surgery is a series of basic but fundamental steps, each with its own nuances. Despite a myriad of published material regarding AVMs, there are few succinct illustrated summaries of these steps with an accompanying elucidation of the most common pitfalls. This paper provides a step-by-step description and illustration of the basic surgical principles of AVM microsurgical resection, focusing on the main key points and addressing the critical issues that surround this surgery. Deep anatomical knowledge and presurgical planning of these basic steps, combined with good contingency management skills, are paramount for an effective and safe AVM surgery.

### B cells defined by immunoglobulin isotypes [^114WJAns]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2:
Fc-dependent antibody functions. Antibodies mediate a variety of effector functions via Fc-dependent interaction with receptors and proteins localised at different sites throughout the body. The most common functions are illustrated here, including (a) degranulation of innate myeloid cells, (b) complement-dependent activation resulting in direct pathogen lysis or enhanced phagocytosis, (c) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by NK cells, (d) opsonisation of pathogens to facilitate phagocytosis, (e) facilitated antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells, (f) receptor-mediated transport of antibody across mucosal barriers, and (g) capture of antigen for regulation of germinal centre responses. * C1q is not a receptor but can bind to antibody Fc and cross-link complement receptors on the surface of macrophages, thereby promoting complement-mediated phagocytosis.

IgD

IgD is the second least abundant antibody class in human serum after IgE and has a relatively short half-life. Despite being scarce in circulation, IgD plays an underappreciated role in mucosal immunity. IgD-producing plasma cells are derived from nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue and have restricted dissemination in the aerodigestive tract. IgD derived from these cells displays extensive somatic hypermutation and recognizes important respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae but also targets commensals and soluble dietary proteins. IgD does not interact with C1q or Fc receptors but instead binds to innate cells such as basophils and mast cells via galectin-9 and CD44. Receptor cross-linking triggers the release of IL-4 which promotes T follicular helper type 2-dependent responses, leading to the production of IgG and IgE. Despite promoting IgE production, IgD also attenuates IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation, pointing to a role for IgD in maintaining homeostasis at mucosal barriers.

### Intestinal permeability – a new target for disease prevention and therapy [^1116vF8i]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Other structures such as blood vessels, smooth muscle cell layers and components of the enteric nervous system (ENS) contribute to the intestinal barrier by regulating the mucosa and by their capacity to initiate specific defense programs in case of danger.

Mammals produce larger amounts of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the mucosa reflecting its central role in immunity and protection against pathogens. B cell activation and proliferation leading to antigen-specific sIgA production occurs in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) via T cell dependent pathways. In addition to the T cell-dependent pathway for IgA production, there is a faster mechanism for generating IgA responses to highly conserved antigenic determinants on commensal bacteria and pathogens. In mice, this involves a specialized subset of B-1 cells that can rapidly produce secretory IgA in the absence of help from CD4+ T cells. This sIgA commonly known as 'natural' antibody and appears to be bind several antigens. The repertoire of 'natural IgA' is restricted and affinity maturation is limited, although the heavy-chain variable region genes used by IgA-producing plasma cells in the gut are somatically hyper-mutated, to diversify antibody specificity. Equivalent B-1 cells have not been identified in humans but they may have functionally equivalent cells that can colonize the lymphoid tissues and generate natural antibody.

Much of the IgA produced in the gut appears not to be reactive to the commensal microbiota. Nevertheless, in germ-free mice sIgA is present at very low levels in the gut and increases substantially soon after colonization with bacteria. sIgA can mediate protection at mucosal surfaces by binding to viruses and bacteria to prevent or inhibit their attachment to and/or invasion of epithelial cells, a process known as immune exclusion. Additionally, sIgA can also interact with antigens presented by intracellular pathogens in endosomes during the pIgR–mediated transport through epithelial cells. Recently we have begun to appreciate its homeostatic roles of sIgA in shaping the intestinal microbiota, preventing mucosal inflammation by immune exclusion, removal of antigen-antibody complexes in the LP and the neutralization of inflammatory mediators.

### Entry route of Salmonella typhimurium directs the type of induced immune response [^116Qc3u1]. Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) represents a first line of defense against mucosal pathogens by limiting their entrance. By using different strains of Salmonella typhimurium that target the two mechanisms of bacterial entry (microfold cell [M cell]- or dendritic cell-mediated), we demonstrated here that the distribution of bacteria after oral infection directed the type of induced immune response. M cell-penetrating invasive, but not noninvasive, S. typhimurium was found in large numbers in Peyer's patches (PPs), leading to the activation of immune cells and the release of fecal IgA. In contrast, both strains of bacteria were equally capable of reaching the mesenteric lymph node and the spleen and inducing IgG responses. These data suggest that PPs are absolutely required for the initiation of an IgA response to Salmonella, whereas they are dispensable for a systemic response. This compartmentalization could allow the fast generation of both mucosal and systemic acquired immunity to pathogens.

### Free and complexed-secretory immunoglobulin A triggers distinct intestinal epithelial cell responses [^111Tc13k]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Understanding of the homeostatic function of SIgA in the gut is critical to elucidate its role in health and disease. Mucosal SIgA comprises the bulk of antibodies in the human gut. An average of 3 g of SIgA is secreted daily into the intestinal tract 22. SIgA is capable of recognizing bacteria by different modes: 'natural' polyreactive (or cross‐reactive) and specific IgA 11. The SIgAs are also able to bind microbiota and promote a controlled antigen sampling of microbial antigens by M cells within the epithelial layer 12. Indeed, in the human gut, 24–74% of the microbiota is coated with SIgA 8, 9. SIgA also helps to reduce pathogen‐mediated proinflammatory responses by the epithelium 14. Despite the importance of these phenomena, little is known regarding how free and microbiota‐complexed SIgA regulate these epithelial cell responses.

### Mucosal vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: scientific gaps and opportunities-workshop report [^116sAUPG]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Several presenters across workshop sessions noted there is uncertainty about which mucosal immune markers are clinically meaningful. Neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies through the Fc, anamnestic antibody responses, and T cells may contribute to protection in the lungs. Neutralizing antibodies and T cells may also play a role in protection in the upper airway. However, the low frequency of T cells induced though parenteral vaccination in the nose may limit that protection. Induction of sIgA and sIgG antibodies in the airway, as well as the presence of airway CD4 + and CD8 + T cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein play a role in mediating mucosal immunity. The role of resident memory B cells producing IgG antibodies in maintaining mucosal immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae was also highlighted, though their role in SARS-CoV-2 mucosal immunity remains to be elucidated. It was noted that the serological threshold of circulating antibodies for protection against mucosal infection may be higher than that required to prevent severe clinical outcomes. Beyond systemic immunity of circulating antibodies, and B and T cells in the blood, other speakers reported that tissue-resident memory B and T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid provide immunity in the lower respiratory mucosa and are part of the protection mechanism. Other presenters noted that vaccinated individuals had substantially fewer spike-specific BAL tissue-resident memory CD4 + T, CD8 + T, and RBD-specific memory B cells compared with a convalescent group who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. These observations are an important addition to other studies that have reported superior mucosal (saliva) antibodies in those with prior COVID-19 compared with vaccinated individualsand the establishment of tissue-resident T cells for up to 6 months after infection. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies conducted at Imperial College London in unvaccinated, uninfected participants suggest that a combination of immune factors, including cross-reactive antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses, the presence and number of cross-reactive non-structural protein (NSP)-specific T cells, and rapid induction of the innate immune response are also associated with either a lack of detectable virus replication on mucosal surfaces or the presence of infection that is only transient in nature –. It was cautioned, however, that these responses do not necessarily constitute sterilizing immunity. Persistent neutralizing antibodies in the upper airway may be required to prevent infection. Speakers also noted that IgA antibodies have short persistence, which may limit the transmission-blocking effectiveness of mucosal vaccines, or require boosting to maintain transmission-blocking efficacy. Determining longevity of IgA antibodies induced from mucosally delivered SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and their role in transmission blocking is a significant research need.

### Blood-borne human plasma cells in steady state are derived from mucosal immune responses [^117J4JW3]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Providing humoral immunity, antibody-secreting plasma cells and their immediate precursors, the plasmablasts, are generated in systemic and mucosal immune reactions. Despite their key role in maintaining immunity and immunopathology, little is known about their homeostasis. Here we show that plasmablasts and plasma cells are always detectable in human blood at low frequency in any unimmunized donor. In this steady state, 80% of plasmablasts and plasma cells express immunoglobulin A (IgA). Expression of a functional mucosal chemokine receptor, C-C motif receptor 10 (CCR10) and the adhesion molecule beta(7) integrin suggests that these cells come from mucosal immune reactions and can return to mucosal tissue. These blood-borne, CCR10(+) plasmablasts also are attracted by CXCL12. Approximately 40% of plasma cells in human bone marrow are IgA(+), nonmigratory, and express beta(7) integrin and CCR10, suggesting a substantial contribution of mucosal plasma cells to bone marrow resident, long-lived plasma cells. Six to 8 days after parenteral tetanus/diphtheria vaccination, intracellular IgG(+) cells appear in blood, both CD62L(+), beta(7) integrin(-), dividing, vaccine-specific, migratory plasmablasts and nondividing, nonmigratory, CD62L(-) plasma cells of different specificities. Systemic vaccination does not impact on peripheral IgA(+) plasmablast numbers, indicating that mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses are regulated independent of each other.

### Immune memory in aging: a wide perspective covering microbiota, brain, metabolism, and epigenetics [^116CKdWR]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

B Cell Development

B cells continuously arise from the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and develop in the bone marrow (BM). HSCs generate multipotent progenitors that eventually diverge to common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Certain environmental cues, transcription factors (TFs), cytokines, and chemokines lead CLPs to differentiate into B-cell lineage. Following differentiation, cells undergo a rearrangement in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and start to express B-cell receptors (BCRs) and IL-7 receptor (IL-7R). Each B cell has a unique BCR with a different specificity to antigens.

B cells that finish their developmental process in the bone marrow are called transitional (TR) B cells. They make 4% of all B lymphocytes in healthy individuals and are found in several places, including the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and secondary lymphoid tissues. Transitional B cells become either marginal zone (MZ) or mature follicular (FO) cells partly based on the strength of their BCR signaling. Cells with more robust signaling tend to develop into follicular type, while weaker signaling drives them to be MZ cells. FO B cells have a broad immunoglobulin repertoire and are located in the follicles close to T cell zones. Therefore, they are suited for getting T-cell help and becoming short-lived plasma cells. On the other hand, MZ B cells can get activated easier than FO B cells, which quickly allow them to produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) or induce class switching without T-cell help.

The third naïve B cell subset is B-1 cells, which are considered part of the innate immune system. Apart from the other B cell subsets developed in the bone marrow, B-1 B cells originate from a distinct progenitor in the fetal bone marrow. They are mainly found in peritoneal and pleural cavities; however, low numbers can also be located in secondary lymphoid organs. During an infection, they act by producing non-specific antibodies that are crucial for early defense.

Advancing age alters the entire course of B cell development, the abundance of distinct B cell subsets, and their function. Furthermore, a B cell subset emerging with increasing age influences immune responses in the elderly.

### Steps dominate gas evasion from a mountain headwater stream [^116LvbEZ]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The ratios between f s and f c in the three target reaches analyzed in this study (the reaches A and B, and the virtual reach A *, see "Methods"), were in the range [0.9−4.3], depending on the underlying discharge level and the specific reach analyzed. These values were calculated taking into account the number and heights of the steps within each reach, and using a linear empirical function to linkto Δ h i as suggested by our experimental data (dashed line in Fig. 3 a). Interestingly, most of the gas evasion induced by the steps was associated with the smallest drop heights. In fact, about 60% of f s was contributed by steps with heights smaller than 35 cm (Supplementary Table 8). Provided that f s turned out to be independent on Q while f c peaked for intermediate discharge levels, r had a non monotonic dependence on Q, with higher values observed for low and high streamflow conditions. While only few experimental points were used to estimate the dependence of the dominance ratio on the discharge, in all the settings analyzed r was systematically larger than (or close to) unity, thereby indicating that the contribution provided by the steps to the total gas evasion from the Valfredda creek was at least 50%, with even higher percentages in correspondence of low-flow and high-flow conditions.

### Human secretory IgM emerges from plasma cells clonally related to gut memory B cells and targets highly diverse commensals [^116KiMX1]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Complex commensal communities generally referred to as microbiota colonize the gut mucosa soon after birth and have a broad impact on host metabolism, immune system development, and gut homeostasis. A central element of gut homeostasis is secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), an antibody that promotes symbiotic host-microbiota interactions by binding commensals inhabiting the small intestine and, to a lesser extent, the large intestine.

SIgA responses to commensals mostly initiate at gut follicular sites of antigen entry, including Peyer's patches. At these sites, sampling of commensals by microfold cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells promotes a sustained germinal center (GC) reaction involving cognate interaction of B cells with T cells, followed by B cell induction of IgM-to-IgA class switching and affinity maturation through class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), respectively. High-affinity and IgA-expressing B cells emerging from GCs upregulate gut-homing receptors and progressively differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma cells (PC-As), which home to the gut lamina propria (LP). These PC-As release polymeric IgA, which translocates across epithelial cells to generate intraluminal SIgA that coats mucus-embedded commensals.

### Effect of end-stage renal disease on B-lymphocyte subpopulations, IL-7, BAFF and BAFF receptor expression [^1143D7m9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The ESRD patients included in the present study exhibited a marked reduction of all B-cell subpopulations except transitional cells that were less severely affected. No difference was observed in the magnitude of B-cell deficiency among diabetic and non-diabetic ESRD subgroups, pointing to the dominant role of ESRD in this process. These findings point to the impact of uraemia on B-cell differentiation and survival as a major cause of B-cell lymphopenia and impaired humoral immunity in ESRD.

B lymphocytes are generated from haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow throughout life. They contribute to the immune system by producing antigen-specific antibodies. IL-7, is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a major part in B lymphopoiesis by promoting the maturation of pre-B cells to B cells in the bone marrow. After differentiation and selection in the bone marrow, newly emerging B lymphocytes (termed transitional B cells, CD19+ CD10+) migrate to the spleen. In humans, CD10 is highly expressed on B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow and progressively disappears with maturation. A majority of CD10+ B cells in the peripheral blood represent immature transitional B cells. Further differentiation of transitional B cells into mature long-lived lymphocytes is critically dependent on BAFF.

The diversity of the B-lymphocyte pool determines the individual's capacity to mount a protective immune response. In adults, innate B1 cells (CD5+ B cells) account for 25–27% of peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Innate B1 cells produce mainly IgM antibodies that have low-affinity and high cross-reactivity properties. These antibodies constitute a readily available pool of immunoglobulins that fight a variety of infections prior to the production of high-affinity-specific antibodies. On the other hand, conventional B cells, otherwise known as B2 cells (CD5− B cells), produce a more diverse array of antibodies with high-affinity interactions, and account for 75–80% of peripheral blood B lymphocytes. When the naive mature B lymphocytes recognize antigen with their specific Ig receptors, they undergo clonal expansion and differentiation into long-lived memory B cells (CD27+) and plasma cells that produce and secrete antigen-specific antibodies. Memory cells that can survive decades actively circulate from blood to lymph nodes and populate mucosal tissues. Upon a subsequent encounter with the antigen, memory B cells respond rapidly by producing Ig isotypes with a high affinity for the given antigen. In adult humans, ∼40% of all circulating B cells are memory B cells.

### Measuring what matters: CPR quality and resuscitation outcomes [^111z8mLz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, this paper raises important points that are well developed in the discussion. The key finding of the study was that CPR duration is highly variable and the variability was only partially explained by patient and hospital factors. This variability in CPR duration is likely a sign of wide variability in CPR knowledge and practice. Such variability will only be reduced when every system that provides resuscitation establishes a process of continuous quality improvement that ensures provision of high‐quality CPR for every victim of every cardiac arrest. Hospitals that participate in registries such as GWTG‐R have taken that first step by collecting data and using it to benchmark their resuscitation performance.

With the 2013 publication of the AHA CPR Quality statement, resuscitation providers now have very specific metrics of CPR performance to monitor and they have specific methods, such as debriefing to improve team performance. Evidence is now accruing that resuscitation consistent with these recommendations does result in improved survival from in‐hospital cardiac arrest. – It is clear that training providers to perform high‐quality CPR with frequent refresher training, measuring and analyzing CPR performance, identifying and correcting errors, and debriefing following resuscitation are all necessary to improve survival from cardiac arrest. Once high‐quality CPR and excellent post‐resuscitation care are standard, identification of reliable prognostic indicators during and after resuscitation will be much less challenging.

### Osteoprotegerin-dependent M cell self-regulation balances gut infection and immunity [^112TQPET]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

SIgA is the most abundant class of antibodies found on the mucosal surface; these antibodies play important roles in protection against pathogens and in the regulation of the gut microbial community. We previously reported that the IgA response is gradually enhanced during the development of DSS-induced colitis. Here, we found that commensal bacteria-specific high-affinity SIgA was abundantly produced in the cLP of Opg −/− mice under inflammatory conditions. Cecal patches are responsible for the generation of IgA + B cells that eventually migrate to the colonic lamina propria. Considering that IgA + B cells were significantly increased in cecal patches of Opg −/− mice in conjunction with the expanded steady-state M-cell population, it is conceivable that these IgA + B cells migrate to the colonic lamina propria to reinforce commensal-specific IgA production under inflammatory conditions. These findings are consistent with the conventional view that M cells serve as entry sites for luminal antigens to facilitate mucosal SIgA responses in GALT. However, recent reports have revealed that IgG responses to commensal bacteria are constitutively induced under physiological conditions. In addition to SIgA, commensal-specific IgG circulating in the blood confronts the occasional intrusion of gut microbes into the internal milieu due to epithelial barrier dysfunction. Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes have been recognized as the major inductive sites for the commensal-specific IgG response. However, our data suggested an important role for cecal patches, rather Peyer's patches, in the production of commensal-specific IgG3. A recent study revealed that colonic IgA-secreting cells were mainly generated in cecal patches. In addition to IgA + B cells, we detected IgG + B cells in cecal patches. Because OPG deficiency increased the numbers of IgG + B cells in cecal patches, we presume that they are maintained by M-cell-dependent uptake of luminal antigens (i.e. commensal microbes). Consistent with this finding, Opg −/− mice displayed higher levels of commensal-specific IgG3 antibodies in the serum. Additionally, commensal-specific IgG1, which is only slightly induced in WT mice, was significantly elevated in Opg −/− mice. Our results support a potential contribution of M-cell-dependent antigen uptake to the production of commensal-specific IgG3.

### Advances and prospects of respiratory mucosal vaccines: mechanisms, technologies, and clinical applications [^113bYN9f]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Innate immune components and antigen uptake

The respiratory mucosa hosts abundant innate immune cells, including alveolar macrophages, unconventional T cells, and particularly, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs are now recognized as key regulators of mucosal immunity and are categorized into ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 subsets. ILC1s secrete IFN-γ and participate in antiviral responses; ILC2s produce IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, mediating anti-parasitic and allergic responses; ILC3s secrete IL-17 and IL-22, enhancing antibacterial defenses and tissue repair. Through cytokine crosstalk, ILCs modulate dendritic cell (DC) activity and T cell priming, shaping the local immune landscape and vaccine responsiveness.

Antigen uptake is coordinated through three main routes: (1) via microfold (M) cells that transport antigens to immune cells, such as mucosal DCs located beneath the epithelium; (2) via epithelial cells that recycle antigens and deliver antibodies to the mucosal surface; and (3) through direct sampling by DCs that extend dendrites across the epithelium to capture antigens and migrate to draining lymph nodes. There, DCs present antigens via MHC molecules, activate naïve T cells, and promote T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation, which supports B cell maturation and high-affinity antibody production in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), such as inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT).

### Identification and characterization of the trypanosoma cruzi B-cell superantigen Tc24 [^111xiGwL]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Data presented in this report demonstrated that Tc24 is a BC-SAg based on the observations that: 1) Tc24 was hydrolyzed by IgM purified from mice and humans not previously exposed to Tc24 by either injection or T. cruzi infection and 2) after exposure to Tc24, the subset of IgM antibodies mediating Tc24 hydrolysis is absent similar to what has been described for other BC-SAgs. Responses to BC-SAgs (i.e. reduction in catalytic activity) are opposite to responses generated after exposure to conventional antigens, which are recognized by complementarity determining regions leading to class-switching and affinity maturation. Antibodies with catalytic potential are an innate immune defense mechanism not associated with adaptive immunity that likely evolved as a means of hydrolyzing antigenic targets. BC-SAgs represent a microbial response to this host defense mechanism that is important to pathogens such as T. cruzi that spend a period of time in the blood stream.

We observed significant hydrolysis of Tc24 at concentrations of IgM approximately 40 times less than the 2 mg/mL present in serum. These data suggested that the presence of catalytic IgM in the preimmune serum may provide some degree of protection against acute forms of disease if the catalytic activity were to remain present long enough to prevent T. cruzi replication and dissemination. On the basis of the observation that catalytic activity was significantly reduced by day-4 postinfection, it is likely that protective catalytic responses would be marginal at best, which may explain why catalytic responses are not protective in the context of acute T. cruzi infections. That IgM plays an important role during the early stages of infection and provides some level of innate protection is supported by the observation that rats deficient in IgM had an increased susceptibility to acute infection. What level of protection would be achieved if catalytic activity were not abolished remains unknown at this time. Therefore, developing vaccine formulations that stimulate rather than reduce catalytic activity against Tc24 may potentially result in a robust immune response with the potential of controlling the initial infection.

### Immunological memory: lessons from the past and a look to the future [^112osKb3]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Immunological memory is considered to be one of the cardinal features of the adaptive immune system. Despite being a recognized phenomenon since the time of the ancient Greeks, immunologists are yet to fully appreciate the mechanisms that control memory responses in the immune system. Furthermore, our definition of immunological memory itself continues to evolve, with recent suggestions that innate immune cells also show memory-like behaviour. In this Viewpoint article, Nature Reviews Immunology invites five leading immunologists to share their thoughts on our current understanding of the nature of immunological memory. Our experts highlight some of the seminal studies that have shaped the immune memory field and offer contrasting views on the key questions that remain to be addressed.

### Gut-associated igAimmune cells regulate obesity-related insulin resistance [^116z4hxa]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a global concern that is associated with many chronic complications such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance (IR), cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Growing evidence has implicated the digestive system, including its microbiota, gut-derived incretin hormones, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue in obesity and IR. During high fat diet (HFD) feeding and obesity, a significant shift occurs in the microbial populations within the gut, known as dysbiosis, which interacts with the intestinal immune system. Similar to other metabolic organs, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver –, altered immune homeostasis has also been observed in the small and large intestines during obesity –.

During diet-induced obesity (DIO), many subsets of adaptive immune cells within the gut adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype, primarily demonstrated by T cells producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ (IFNγ). This shift is accompanied by a reduction in proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other immune cells, including interleukin-22 (IL-22) producing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and T-helper type 17 (Th17) T cells, which help to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In addition to microbial dysbiosis, HFD feeding is associated with aberrant mucosal barrier function, subsequent bacterial product leakage, and metabolic endotoxemia. Despite these findings, changes in additional gut immune populations, including B and plasma cells, during DIO and mechanisms behind intestinal immune regulation of glucose homeostasis remain unclear.

A link between the gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system is the immune-derived molecule immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA is a B cell antibody primarily produced in dimeric form by plasma cells residing in the gut lamina propria (LP). The production of IgA is influenced by innate immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs) and pathogen sensing pathways, such as Toll-like receptor 2 –. IgA can also be produced by B1 cells, and these cells may modulate IR. In conjunction with antimicrobial peptides, mucus and host defense molecules, IgA is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis through protection of the mucosal surface from pathogens while tolerating commensal bacteria using mechanisms such as immune exclusion. IgA directly binds to commensal bacteria together with the mucous layer to prevent bacteria from breaching the intestinal epithelial barrier, and also assists in the expulsion of bacterial components that have intruded the epithelial barrier.

### Mucosal immune network in the gut for the control of infectious diseases [^113oNMDg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

The common mucosal immune system (CMIS) consists of an integrated cross-communication pathway of lymphoid tissues made up of inductive and effector sites for host protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Major effector molecules of the CMIS include IgA antibodies and cytokines, chemokines and their corresponding receptors. Secretory IgA (S-IgA), the major immunoglobulin, is induced by gut-associated lymphoreticular tissue (GALT)-derived B cells with the help of Th1- and Th2-type CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the mucosal epithelium, a subpopulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), also help maintain the mucosal barrier. The CMIS is unique in that it can provide both positive and negative signals for the induction and regulation of immune responses in both the mucosal and systemic compartments after oral or nasal antigen exposure. Prevention of infection through mucosal surfaces can be achieved by the CMIS through connections between inductive (e.g. GALT) and effector tissues. When vaccine antigens are enterically administered together with mucosal adjuvants [e.g. cholera toxin (CT), heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli (LT) and IL-12], antigen-specific Th1/Th2 and IgA B cell responses are induced simultaneously in the mucosal effector compartment. Since these antigen-specific immune responses are not generated by oral vaccine without mucosal adjuvant, safe and effective adjuvants for the induction of antigen-specific S-IgA and CTL responses are essential for the development of mucosal vaccines for protection against infectious diseases. Finally, recent findings suggest the presence of a CMIS-independent IgA induction pathway, which also must be considered in the development of mucosal vaccines.

### Human peritoneal mesothelial cells respond to bacterial ligands through a specific subset of toll-like receptors [^114ZNZML]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Repeated peritonitis is a feature of PD treatment and predominantly caused by Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus species. However, Gram-negative bacterial infections also represent a significant problem and overall have a worse prognosis in terms of patient outcomes. It is a generally thought that host defenses are compromised in PD patients as a result of dialysis solution exposure, dilution of humoral factors and alteration in resident and recruited leucocytes function. The initial peritoneal immune response involves contributions not only from resident peritoneal leucocytes but also from the peritoneal mesothelial cells, lining the parietal and visceral peritoneum. Mesothelial cells express adhesion molecules, synthesize cytokines and chemokines and present antigen via major histocompatibility complex Class II, promoting CD4 + T-cell responses. Therefore, we examined TLR expression by HPMC and characterized their responses to bacterial agonists. To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive characterization of TLR expression and responsiveness to bacterial ligands in primary HPMC to date.

### CXCL13 is required for B1 cell homing, natural antibody production, and body cavity immunity [^1146e4Uz]. Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

B1 cells are a predominant cell type in body cavities and an important source of natural antibody. Here we report that in mice lacking the chemokine, CXCL13, B1 cells are deficient in peritoneal and pleural cavities but not in spleen. CXCL13 is produced by cells in the omentum and by peritoneal macrophages, and in adoptive transfers, B1 cells home to the omentum and the peritoneal cavity in a CXCL13-dependent manner. CXCL13(-/-) mice are deficient in preexisting phosphorylcholine (PC)-specific antibodies and in their ability to mount an anti-PC response to peritoneal streptococcal antigen. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of B1 cell homing and establish a critical role for B1 cell compartmentalization in the production of natural antibodies and for body cavity immunity.

### The omentum is a site of protective IgM production during intracellular bacterial infection [^114DgZsX]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Infection of mice with the bacterium Ehrlichia muris elicits a protective T cell-independent (TI) IgM response mediated primarily by a population of CD11c-expressing plasmablasts in the spleen. Although splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells are considered to be important for TI responses to blood-borne pathogens, MZ B cells were not responsible for generating plasmablasts in response to Ehrlichia muris. Moreover, antigen-specific serum IgM was decreased only modestly in splenectomized mice and in mice that lacked spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches (SLP mice). Both splenectomized and SLP mice were protected against lethal ehrlichial challenge infection. Moreover, we found a high frequency of Ehrlichia-specific plasmablasts in the omentum of both conventional and SLP mice. Omental plasmablasts elicited during Ehrlichia infection lacked expression of CD138 but expressed CD11c in a manner similar to that of their splenic counterparts. Selective ablation of CD11c-expressing B cells nearly eliminated the omental Ehrlichia-specific plasmablasts and reduced antigen-specific serum IgM, identifying the omental B cells as a source of IgM production in the SLP mice. Generation of the omental plasmablasts was route dependent, as they were detected following peritoneal infection but not following intravenous infection. Our data identify the omentum as an important auxiliary site of IgM production during intracellular bacterial infection.

### Mucosal or systemic microbiota exposures shape the B cell repertoire [^1142gzeq]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Colonization by the microbiota causes a marked stimulation of B cells and induction of immunoglobulin, but mammals colonized with many taxa have highly complex and individualized immunoglobulin repertoires 1,2. Here we use a simplified model of defined transient exposures to different microbial taxa in germ-free mice 3 to deconstruct how the microbiota shapes the B cell pool and its functional responsiveness. We followed the development of the immunoglobulin repertoire in B cell populations, as well as single cells by deep sequencing. Microbial exposures at the intestinal mucosa generated oligoclonal responses that differed from those of germ-free mice, and from the diverse repertoire that was generated after intravenous systemic exposure to microbiota. The IgA repertoire-predominantly to cell-surface antigens-did not expand after dose escalation, whereas increased systemic exposure broadened the IgG repertoire to both microbial cytoplasmic and cell-surface antigens. These microbial exposures induced characteristic immunoglobulin heavy-chain repertoires in B cells, mainly at memory and plasma cell stages. Whereas sequential systemic exposure to different microbial taxa diversified the IgG repertoire and facilitated alternative specific responses, sequential mucosal exposure produced limited overlapping repertoires and the attrition of initial IgA binding specificities. This shows a contrast between a flexible response to systemic exposure with the need to avoid fatal sepsis, and a restricted response to mucosal exposure that reflects the generic nature of host-microbial mutualism in the mucosa.

However, a posteriori deciphering of the biological bases for the efficacy of successful vaccines should be an essential component of research efforts directed at the development of new vaccines for the most challenging infectious diseases.

### Human secretory IgM emerges from plasma cells clonally related to gut memory B cells and targets highly diverse commensals [^115q4jT7]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

The T cell-dependent (TD) pathway is complemented by a T cell-independent (TI) pathway entailing activation of follicular and possibly extrafollicular B cells by various cells of the innate immune system. Complementary TD and TI responses generate circulating IgA class-switched memory (ME-A) B cells and cooperatively shape the architecture of the microbiota during the development of an individual. However, the TD pathway may become predominant over time due to continuous accumulation of ME-A B cells.

ME-A B cells emerge from gut inductive sites along with PC-As and continuously diversify their B cell receptor repertoire via a microbiota-stimulated adaptation process involving induction of SHM and PC-A differentiation in pre-existing GCs.

In addition to PC-As, the gut mucosa contains IgM-secreting PCs (PC-Ms) that release SIgM into the lumen through the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). In mice, SIgM production increases upon induction of colonic damage to prevent lethal dissemination of commensals. However, little else is known about the ontogeny, regulation, and function of SIgM, particularly in humans. A better understanding of this mucosal antibody may further elucidate host-microbiota interactions in health and disease states. Indeed, primary antibody deficiency patients selectively lacking SIgA rarely develop inflammatory bowel disease, which is instead more common and very severe in patients lacking both SIgM and SIgA.

We found that human PC-Ms coexisted with a large but previously unrecognized repertoire of gut-specific memory IgM + (ME-M) B cells that were clonally related to PC-Ms as well as some ME-A B cells and PC-As. In addition to inducing IgM-to-IgA CSR, ME-M cells exposed to TD or TI signals secreted copious IgM that targeted mucus-embedded commensals, similar to SIgM from PC-Ms. Unlike its murine counterpart, human SIgM recognized bacteria dually coated by SIgA that were characterized by increased diversity compared to SIgA-only-coated or uncoated bacteria. Thus, SIgM may emerge from pre-existing ME-M B cells rather than newly activated naive B cells and could help SIgA to anchor highly diverse microbial communities to gut mucus.

### Protection from septic peritonitis by rapid neutrophil recruitment through omental high endothelial venules [^111CjNJH]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Multiple clinical conditions such as trauma, surgery, liver cirrhosis, peritoneal dialysis catheters or disruption of the gastrointestinal tract can cause peritonitis. Subsequent systemic spread of intra-abdominal pathogens results in sepsis with high mortality and medical treatment is challenging.

Leucocyte influx into the peritoneal cavity is a hallmark of abdominal inflammation but the routes of neutrophil emigration remain enigmatic. Here we studied the greater omentum, an intraperitoneal organ deriving from the greater curvature of the stomach and the spleen. It consists of a double layer of mesothelial cells that encapsulates a highly vascularized parenchyma of fatty tissue and multiple immune cell aggregates called milky spots. These are considered unconventional secondary lymphoid organsand consist mostly of B1-cells, macrophages, T cells and mast cells, and lack follicular dendritic cells and germinal centres. Milky spots dynamically increase in number and size in chronic inflammation or irritationand a role in natural antibody production and adaptive peritoneal immunity is well established. A key feature is the presence of a specialized type of postcapillary venule called high endothelial venule (HEV) that is essential for lymphocyte trafficking. Similar innate B1-cell-rich clusters in adipose tissues have been observed in the mouse mesentery, the pleural cavity and the pericardium, and are termed fat-associated lymphoid clusters.

To date, little is known about the regulatory functions of the greater omentum in innate immunity. Therefore, we studied its impact on leucocyte recruitment to and bacterial spread from the abdominal cavity in murine models of acute peritonitis. We can show that the first wave of neutrophils recruited to the inflamed peritoneum uses milky spot HEVs as exit site with unique molecular properties and that specific inhibition of this pathway leads to systemic bacterial spread and clinical exacerbation of septic peritonitis.

### Is the oral microbiome a source to enhance mucosal immunity against infectious diseases? [^117Q1HkA]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

Mucosal IL-17-producing T-cells

Mucosal tissue is characterized by epithelial cells, connective tissue and resident myeloid and lymphoid cell types. Within these tissues reside IL-17-producing lymphocytes, which can further be divided into ɑβ and ɣδ T-cells (ɑβTc and ɣδTc). The ɣδTc have been described as an innate-type of T-cell that are unrestricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class molecules, that appear required for macrophage recruitment and differentiation upon bacterial challenge –, and can, upon direct stimulation, produce the antibacterial products granulysin and defensin to provide barrier protection. The IL-17+ɑβTc, more commonly known as Th17 mediate a heterologous mucosal immunity that is independent of antibody response. The ɣδTc have been shown to shape the T-cell repertoire in the mucosal tissues and contribute to induction of Th17 memory subsets. Although both Th17 and ɣδTccan develop memory subsets that respond rapidly to challenges specific to mucosal protection, Th17 immunity is linked to the production of a protective IgA responsemaking the Th17 cells attractive targets for vaccine design.

### Immunoprofiles associated with controlled human malaria infection and naturally acquired immunity identify a shared IgA pre-erythrocytic immunoproteome [^111ZAQR5]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

One possible explanation for the observation of IgA following malaria infection is that mucosal immunity may be a significant but until recently under-recognized component of the immune response to P. falciparum malaria. In studies of a radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine) in Tanzanian adultsand non-human primate hepatocytes, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells were observed following immunization. MAIT cells, a component of the innate immune response, are enriched at mucosal sites and have been observed to stimulate IgA, IgG, and IgM production in an ex vivo model. Another study demonstrated that altered signal transduction and inflammation in host hepatocytes during the pre-erythrocytic phase of malaria infection results in upregulation of a human transmembrane mucin, MUC13. The presence of MAIT cells and upregulation of a mucin both suggest a role of mucosal immunity in the response to P. falciparum infection, perhaps induced when pre-erythrocytic antigens traverse through the hepatic mucosal surface and elicit mucosal immune responses, including IgA. Alternatively, during malaria blood stage infection, γδ T cells migrate through colonic mucosa and subsequently induce an IgA response. On the other hand, studies conducted in germ-free mice with no mucosal microbiota stimulus and in mice with defective intestinal homing signals demonstrate serum IgA production separate from mucosal IgA production –.

Our data are consistent with a recent report of experimental infection in naive mice with Babesia, a red blood cell pathogen that causes erythrocyte deformation and lysis, splenic enlargement, increase in number of splenocytes, and transient increases in IgA and IgG antibody titers within weeks. In humans, malaria is associated with splenomegaly that may be provoked by the spleen's main function of recycling aged and damaged red blood cells, including those that contain parasites. Despite parasite-mediated changes in splenic architecture and resulting immunomodulation, the spleen mounts an immune response that includes production of antibodies from splenic plasma cells. In humans, newly class-switched IgA circle transcripts were as abundant in the spleen as in gut mucosal sites and lymphoid follicles, indicating that the spleen is likely a major source of the predominating monomeric IgA1 in serum. In mice, a recent review concludes that both peritoneal "innate-like" B1 B cells and splenic marginal zone B cells can contribute to IgA production. Thus, our data suggest that a transient rise in newly generated IgA positive plasmablasts and plasma cells, possibly induced in the spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and/or peritoneum of infected patients, may have given rise to the transient IgA titers seen in our study population.

### Fat-associated lymphoid clusters control local IgM secretion during pleural infection and lung inflammation [^113Ziokj]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The serous membranes covering the viscera and the wall of the body cavities define three fluid-filled cavities: the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities. These serous cavities constitute important reservoirs of innate-like B-cell subsets, also called B1 cells, the major innate function of which is to ensure early immune protection from infection by rapid secretion of natural IgM. How and where natural IgM are secreted is not fully understood. Natural IgM antibodies do not undergo affinity maturation and thus bind antigens with overall low affinity. Although pentameric structures highly increase the avidity of IgM, such arrangements also limit diffusion into tissues, meaning that secretion into the circulation does not guarantee efficacy at the site of infection. Paradoxically, many studies have reported that peritoneal cavity B1 cells do not secrete antibodies either at steady state or upon peritoneal cavity challenge. Upon activation, peritoneal B1 cells can relocate to the red pulp of the spleen, where they start producing IgM enabling secretion into the circulation, or to the intestine for secretion of IgM and IgA at the mucosal barrier. Immune protection of the peritoneal cavity is orchestrated by inducible lymphoid structures found within certain visceral adipose tissue deposits: the milky spots of the omentum and fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALC) of the mesenteries. Upon immune challenge, these structures support rapid activation of serous B cells and germinal center formation. The existence of similar lymphoid structures has been reported in the adipose deposits of the pleural cavity, the mediastinumand the pericardium. Although the density of FALCs in pericardium and mediastinum is high, the functional role of these clusters has not been investigated. Critically, the pleural cavity is an immune site of medical importance for the understanding of airway associated diseases, but little is known about the role of pleural B cells or the mechanisms controlling their function.

### Role of group 3 innate lymphoid cells in antibody production [^11717wxY]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) constitute a heterogeneous family of effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that mediate lymphoid organogenesis, tissue repair, immunity and inflammation. The initial view that ILCs exert their protective functions solely during the innate phase of an immune response has been recently challenged by evidence indicating that ILCs shape adaptive immunity by establishing both contact-dependent and contact-independent interactions with multiple hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, including B cells. Some of these interactions enhance antibody responses both systemically and at mucosal sites of entry.

### NOD-like receptors mediate homeostatic intestinal epithelial barrier function: promising therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease [^114UGrq2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunological barrier

The intestinal mucosal immune barrier is mainly composed of gut-associated lymphocyte tissue (GALT) and diffuse immune cells [innate immune cells (neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells) and adaptive immune cells (B and T cells)]. Moreover, epithelial cells are increasingly viewed as an integral part of the immune barrier. The GALT secretes immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, and IgA forms IgA – antigen complexes with antigenic substances. The IgA antigen complexes bind to the receptors on M cells. The antigens are then transferred to the lamina propria and subsequently presented to dendritic cells. Antigen-presenting cells in the lamina propria receive immune-stimulating antigens from the cavity, process those antigens, and present them to T cells. The IL-12 secreted by antigen-presenting cells can promote the production of Th1 by T cells, but the simultaneous production of IL-10 limits Th1 immune responses. Additionally, IgA promotes the renewal of intestinal epithelial cells, and repairs damage over time, stabilizing the intestinal mucosal barrier. In summary, the main function of the intestinal mucosal immune barrier is to recognize antigens in the body, generate humoral and cellular immunity, and effectively remove antigens.

In conclusion, the intestinal mucosal barrier is an important protective mechanism and defense system for maintaining body health. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the interaction between each barrier forms a complex regulatory network, which fully plays the role of preventing the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms, regulating antigen import, and inhibiting inflammation (Figure 1).

### Mucosal immunoglobulins at respiratory surfaces mark an ancient association that predates the emergence of tetrapods [^115oBVYd]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Three B-cell subsets have been identified in catfish: IgM + IgD −, IgM + IgD +, IgM − IgD +, while generally two B-cell subsets can be identified in all other species that contain IgT/IgZ, including the IgM + IgD + IgT − and the IgM − IgD − IgT +. Moreover, one study has recently described a new population of trout IgD + B cells devoid of surface IgM expression (IgD + IgM − B cells), which was shown to represent a major B-cell subset in gill. Since the same antibodies used in the aforementioned study had failed to detect these IgD + IgM − B cells in a previous study, it was suggested that this B-cell subset might only be present in an European trout line.

Gills are considered a mucosal surface, and through convergent evolution they have evolved structures and components similar to those of the mammalian respiratory mucosa. In this regard, the epithelia of gill primary and secondary lamella is covered by one to four layers of cuboidal or squamous cell epithelia, similar to what it is found in the upper respiratory tract of mammals. Another similarity between these surfaces is the existence of local mucus-secreting cells (that is, goblet cells), which are characteristic of type I mucosal epithelia, and represent the first line of defense and cell protection. In the lungs, which represent a type I mammalian mucosal surface, secretory IgA (sIgA) is produced locally and is a key immunoglobulin involved in mucosal respiratory immunological responses. A number of reports have described the induction of gill pathogen-specific IgM titres on pathogenic challenge or vaccination, while antigen-specific responses mediated by other teleost immunoglobulins are thus far unknown. Since IgT in fish plays a key role in mucosal immunity in the gut and skin, it is conceivable that IgT plays a pivotal role in gill immunity. However, it has recently been suggested that trout IgD may play an important function in gill immune responses. Thus, the role of the different teleost immunoglobulins in the gill remains to be clearly delineated.

### The variability of the serological response to SARS-corona virus-2: potential resolution of ambiguity through determination of avidity (functional affinity) [^115ewLAX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Variability of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) response: delayed and missing IgM responses. A, Delayed IgM response. A delayed differentiation of IgM‐presenting B cells to plasma cells (#1‐5), in combination with a fast immunoglobulin class switch (#8) and generation of IgG‐producing plasma cells (#9) explains the frequently observed phenomenon of delayed appearance of IgM in the serum, though IgM‐presenting B cells are always generated first. B, Missing IgM response in the serum. A low degree of replication of IgM‐presenting B cells and their early cell death (#3) prevents differentiation to IgM‐producing plasma cells and does not lead to detectable IgM in the serum, whereas IgG is produced and matures with respect to avidity. This scenario explains how IgG production depends on IgM‐presenting B cells, without IgM being detectable in the serum [Color figure can be viewed at]

1.3 How was the problem of variable IgM responses satisfactorily resolved to reach a rational and unambiguous diagnostics?

Especially, the pioneering work of Hedman and coworkers led to the establishment of quantitative measurements of IgG avidity and thus allowed for a clear distinction between acute infection with IgG of low avidity and past infection with high avidity of IgG. The discussion of this useful method requires a quick reflection about the underlying biological mechanisms: During an immune response, clonal selection of B cells that generate IgG with higher affinity leads to the gradual increase in affinity of serum IgG. Affinity of IgG toward an antigen represents a complex biophysical process, determined by the binding and the release reaction of antibody from its target. As this process cannot be easily measured in routine applications, applied research restricted the analysis on determining the strength of the binding between antigen and IgG. This was measured by allowing first an undisturbed antibody‐antigen reaction, and then testing the degree of release of antibody through the application of chaotropic agents like urea. This approach has been termed "avidity" determination (derived from latin aviditas, meaning desire, greed) or determination of "functional affinity". (It is noteworthy that the term "avidity" as used in modern serology is defining a different biochemical setting than the same word previously used to describe the complexity of multivalent antibody and target structure populations. The use of one term for two different aspects frequently leads to confusion.)

### Innate production of T (H) 2 cytokines by adipose tissue-associated C-kit (+) sca-1 (+) lymphoid cells [^115xVBZp]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Innate immune responses are important in combating various microbes during the early phases of infection. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that, unlike T and B lymphocytes, do not express antigen receptors but rapidly exhibit cytotoxic activities against virus-infected cells and produce various cytokines. Here we report a new type of innate lymphocyte present in a novel lymphoid structure associated with adipose tissues in the peritoneal cavity. These cells do not express lineage (Lin) markers but do express c-Kit, Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a), IL7R and IL33R. Similar lymphoid clusters were found in both human and mouse mesentery and we term this tissue 'FALC' (fat-associated lymphoid cluster). FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells are distinct from lymphoid progenitors and lymphoid tissue inducer cells. These cells proliferate in response to IL2 and produce large amounts of T(H)2 cytokines such as IL5, IL6 and IL13. IL5 and IL6 regulate B-cell antibody production and self-renewal of B1 cells. Indeed, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells support the self-renewal of B1 cells and enhance IgA production. IL5 and IL13 mediate allergic inflammation and protection against helminth infection. After helminth infection and in response to IL33, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells produce large amounts of IL13, which leads to goblet cell hyperplasia-a critical step for helminth expulsion. In mice devoid of FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells, such goblet cell hyperplasia was not induced. Thus, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells are T(H)2-type innate lymphocytes, and we propose that these cells be called 'natural helper cells'.

### Recruited macrophages that colonize the post-inflammatory peritoneal niche convert into functionally divergent resident cells [^115bum1F]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In addition to perturbed homeostasis of B1-cells, high-dose zymosan treatment led to a significant long-term elevation in number of peritoneal neutrophils and decrease in number of naïve CD62L + peritoneal T cells, suggesting persistent low-grade peritoneal inflammation. Whether this represents a permanent alteration in tissue homeostasis and if so whether this arises from innate or adaptive immune memoryor dysregulation of normal feedback loops between tissue T cells and macrophagesremains unclear, but notably, loss of peritoneal CD62L + T-cells has been implicated in low-grade peritoneal inflammation and induction of MHCII-expression on peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, we cannot at present exclude the possibility that these alterations in immune cell homeostasis are driven by the continued presence of an undetected reservoir of zymosan.

Our study highlights how varying degrees of inflammation alter the peritoneal macrophage compartment long-term and consequently reshape peritoneal homeostasis, and implicates competition for niche signals, time-of-residency and alterations in niche as principal determinants of these phenomena. These findings have broad importance for our understanding of plasticity within the mononuclear phagocyte compartment. Furthermore, understanding the consequences of inflammation in the serous cavities has major implications for pathologies in which serous cavity macrophages play key roles, including endometriosis, adhesions, and repair and scarring of visceral organs, and the myriad of diseases influenced by natural antibody.

### Activation of B-1 cells promotes tumor cell killing in the peritoneal cavity [^115zVP9t]. Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Metastatic cancer involving spread to the peritoneal cavity is referred to as peritoneal carcinomatosis and has a very poor prognosis. Activating the antitumor immune response in the characteristically immune-suppressive peritoneal environment presents a potential strategy to treat this disease. In this study, we show that a toll-like receptor (TLR) and C-type lectin receptor (CLR) agonist pairing of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and trehalose-6,6'-dicorynomycolate (TDCM) effectively inhibits tumor growth and ascites development in a mouse model of aggressive mammary cancer-induced peritoneal carcinomatosis. MPL/TDCM treatment similarly inhibited peritoneal EL4 tumor growth and ascites development. These effects were not observed in mice lacking B cells or mice lacking CD19, which are deficient in B-1a cells, an innate-like B-cell population enriched in the peritoneal cavity. Remarkably, adoptive transfer of B-1a cells, but not splenic B cells from WT mice, restored MPL/TDCM-induced protection in mice with B-cell defects. Treatment induced B-1 cells to rapidly produce high levels of natural IgM reactive against tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens. Consistent with this, we found significant deposition of IgM and C3 on peritoneal tumor cells as early as 5 days post-treatment. Mice unable to secrete IgM or complement component C4 were not protected by MPL/TDCM treatment, indicating tumor killing was mediated by activation of the classical complement pathway. Collectively, our findings reveal an unsuspected role for B-1 cell-produced natural IgM in providing protection against tumor growth in the peritoneal cavity, thereby highlighting potential opportunities to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of peritoneal metastases. SIGNIFICANCE: This work identifies a critical antitumor role for innate-like B cells localized within the peritoneal cavity and demonstrates a novel strategy to activate their tumor-killing potential.

### B cells defined by immunoglobulin isotypes [^113Dtax1]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

IgM

IgM plays a significant role in initiating immune responses and pathogen clearance. This isotype is produced early after antigen encounter by short-lived extrafollicular plasma cells, but can also be generated by affinity-matured long-lived plasma cells. The pentameric structure of IgM (Fig. 1) provides high avidity for antigen binding, which offsets the typically lower affinity of IgM relative to other subclasses. Antigen binding results in a conformational change in IgM structure, exposing a C1q-binding site that promotes highly efficient activation of complement. The unique structure of IgM also permits effective agglutination of intestinal microbiota which promotes microbe clearance and limits antigen penetration into the epithelium. In addition, natural IgM is produced spontaneously by distinct subsets of B cells in the absence of antigen stimulation or T cell help. Natural IgM is germline encoded, usually polyreactive, and recognizes a broad range of antigens including self-molecules. This isotype also provides immediate early protection against infection, for example through effective virus neutralization. In humans, a population of CD20 + CD27 + CD43 + CD70 − cells that are functionally equivalent to murine B1 cells produce natural antibodies. However, unlike mice the main source of human natural antibodies is marginal zone B cells. IgM comprises around 10% of serum antibodies but also has a key role in mucosal immunity, making up 10–20% of the plasma cell population in the human terminal ileum. Polymeric IgM binds to pIgR via its J-chain to enable transport across the epithelium as secretory IgM. Secretory IgM, which is mostly derived from natural IgM, plays a role in maintaining tolerance of commensal bacteria (reviewed in). The subject of IgM B cells is covered elsewhere in this issue. Selective IgM deficiency is a rare disorder that can result in the recurrent upper respiratory tract and systemic infections, as well as less common allergic and autoimmune conditions. IgM-containing immune complexes can bind to Fcα/μR, which in humans is primarily expressed on follicular dendritic cells. Pentameric IgM associates with the protein apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM) to facilitate retention of immune complexes in germinal centres. These complexes provide a key source of antigen for B cell maturation in germinal centre responses, thus highlighting an additional role for IgM in regulating adaptive immunity.

### Filters: when, why, and how (not) to use them [^116A6yDq]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Filters are commonly used to reduce noise and improve data quality. Filter theory is part of a scientist's training, yet the impact of filters on interpreting data is not always fully appreciated. This paper reviews the issue and explains what a filter is, what problems are to be expected when using them, how to choose the right filter, and how to avoid filtering by using alternative tools. Time-frequency analysis shares some of the same problems that filters have, particularly in the case of wavelet transforms. We recommend reporting filter characteristics with sufficient details, including a plot of the impulse or step response as an inset.
