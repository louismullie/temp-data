## Question

Hospital delirium treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hospital delirium treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical question and define the population, intervention, comparators, and outcomes. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will examine non-pharmacologic strategies, followed by pharmacologic options by setting, and finally synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with monitoring and safety considerations, while noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and scope. Hospital delirium spans ICU, general medical/surgical wards, and palliative care, so I need to distinguish prevention from treatment and consider setting-specific evidence. The highest-yield sources are systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and contemporary guidelines, with attention to ICU versus non-ICU populations and to core outcomes like delirium duration, severity, mortality, and functional recovery [^2ad427ca] [^d80d95ff].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and identify anchor sources. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to prioritize high-quality syntheses and guidelines. The 2019 Annals systematic review on antipsychotics for treating delirium in hospitalized adults, the 2018 Cochrane review on antipsychotics in non-ICU patients, the 2019 Cochrane review on pharmacologic interventions in critically ill adults, and the 2025 APA Practice Guideline provide the most authoritative, setting-specific guidance, while HELP and related multicomponent programs anchor non-pharmacologic prevention and treatment frameworks [^a370aeb8] [^23bd09e2] [^873ffd57] [^fdd80f81] [^88b4f4af].

> I will now examine non-pharmacologic strategies, because these are consistently recommended as first-line for prevention and as foundational for treatment. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. Multicomponent non-pharmacologic interventions such as HELP reduce incident delirium by roughly 30–50% across hospital settings, with moderate-certainty evidence, and are endorsed by major guidelines; components include reorientation, sleep optimization, early mobilization, vision/hearing aids, hydration, and medication review, often delivered by interdisciplinary teams [^88b4f4af] [^3b7a7b4f] [^2ad427ca] [^fdd80f81]. I should double-check that these benefits extend to treatment of established delirium; while prevention data are stronger, implementation studies suggest reduced delirium duration and improved process measures when these bundles are applied to active delirium, though higher-quality RCTs are needed for treatment endpoints [^88b4f4af].

> Now, for ICU delirium treatment, I need to check the status of antipsychotics. The 2019 Cochrane review found no consistent benefit of antipsychotics on delirium duration or other patient-centered outcomes, and the 2025 focused update concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against antipsychotics for ICU delirium treatment, noting a possible small increase in delirium-free days and a possible mortality signal that did not reach statistical significance, with arrhythmia risk that warrants caution [^873ffd57] [^773fdd66]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal; pooled analyses suggest haloperidol may reduce mortality versus placebo, but confidence intervals overlap and trial sequential analysis has not reached firm conclusions, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^09c0a583] [^896c1996].

> For non-ICU hospitalized adults with established delirium, I should confirm the stance on antipsychotics. The Annals review and the Cochrane non-ICU review converge: there is no consistent benefit of haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotics on delirium duration, severity, resolution, or mortality, and routine use is not supported; antipsychotics may be considered only for severe agitation threatening safety or essential care, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration, with close monitoring [^a370aeb8] [^23bd09e2]. But wait, what if the patient has distressing psychotic features? Even then, evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized, with explicit reassessment of ongoing need [^2ad427ca].

> In palliative care, I should review the limited RCT data carefully. Trials in terminally ill adults show no clear benefit of haloperidol or risperidone over placebo for delirium symptoms and suggest possible worsening of delirium severity in some comparisons, alongside increased extrapyramidal symptoms; thus, pharmacologic therapy should be reserved for distressing symptoms or safety concerns, and non-pharmacologic comfort measures prioritized [^dd28ecd0]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought haloperidol might consistently improve agitation in this group, but the data are mixed and often not statistically significant, reinforcing a conservative approach [^dd28ecd0].

> Let me consider alternatives when antipsychotics are contraindicated or ineffective. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine delirium treatment outside alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, given limited efficacy and risk of oversedation; evidence in non-ICU settings is sparse and low quality, so they should be avoided as first-line for agitation [^066335da] [^273c9d15]. Cholinesterase inhibitors have not shown benefit for treating established delirium and should not be started for this indication, although prophylactic use in surgical populations may reduce incidence, which is a different question than treatment [^fca83f1c] [^33671b59]. Dexmedetomidine shows promise for reducing delirium duration in ICU settings, but evidence is heterogeneous and not directly applicable to non-ICU treatment; it remains a sedative alternative rather than a general delirium treatment [^873ffd57].

> I should confirm safety monitoring if antipsychotics are used off-label. Key risks include QT prolongation, torsades, extrapyramidal symptoms, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome; baseline and serial ECGs are prudent in patients with cardiac risk, and drug–drug interactions should be screened, especially with other QT-prolonging agents; in older adults, start low and go slow, for example haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV/PO with cautious titration, and reassess frequently for ongoing need [^b2c15aeb] [^2ad427ca]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this cautious stance; yes, major guidelines emphasize minimal effective dosing, time-limited use, and continuous non-pharmacologic care in parallel [^2ad427ca] [^fdd80f81].

> Next, I should review implementation and systems issues, because effectiveness depends on how care is delivered. Multicomponent bundles require protocolized workflows, education, and leadership support; the Australian Delirium Clinical Care Standard and the ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle operationalize these elements, and adherence to delirium monitoring correlates with improved outcomes, underscoring the need for reliable detection and consistent intervention delivery [^8b78e253] [^372de200] [^4f96abe2]. I need to ensure we also address modifiable risk factors such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, sleep disruption, immobility, and sensory deficits, as these materially influence delirium trajectory and recovery [^2ad427ca] [^d80d95ff].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For all hospitalized patients with delirium, immediately identify and treat precipitating causes, implement multicomponent non-pharmacologic interventions, and monitor severity with validated tools such as CAM-ICU or 4AT; reserve antipsychotics for severe agitation or psychosis that threatens safety or essential care, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and reassess daily for de-escalation or discontinuation; in the ICU, recognize that antipsychotics are not routinely recommended and dexmedetomidine may be considered as a sedative alternative within a bundle; in palliative care, prioritize comfort, family support, and non-pharmacologic measures, using medications sparingly for distressing symptoms [^2ad427ca] [^fdd80f81] [^773fdd66] [^dd28ecd0]. I should double-check that this aligns with major guidelines; yes, this reflects the consensus across high-quality reviews and professional society guidance [^2ad427ca] [^fdd80f81] [^773fdd66].

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and research directions. Evidence gaps persist regarding treatment of established delirium, optimal dosing and duration of antipsychotics when needed, and the role of etiologic phenotyping to personalize therapy; core outcome sets and adaptive trial designs are being advanced to harmonize endpoints and accelerate discovery, and long-term cognitive and functional outcomes remain underreported and should be prioritized in future trials [^0f3ebe6d] [^421c0675] [^cf59b978]. Hold on, I should verify that current practice remains dynamic; indeed, as new RCTs emerge, especially in ICU and palliative populations, recommendations may evolve, so clinicians should periodically revisit the evidence base and local protocols [^773fdd66] [^09c0a583].

---

Hospital delirium treatment centers on **multicomponent nonpharmacologic care** [^2ad427ca] as first-line therapy, including reorientation, sleep optimization, early mobilization, hydration, vision/hearing aids, and medication review [^88b4f4af] [^3b7a7b4f]. Antipsychotics are **not routinely recommended** [^a370aeb8]; reserve haloperidol or second-generation agents for severe agitation or psychosis that threatens safety or care, using the lowest effective dose and close monitoring for adverse effects [^2ad427ca] [^b2c15aeb]. Benzodiazepines are avoided except for alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal [^066335da] [^273c9d15]. Address underlying causes, monitor vitals and mental status, and reassess daily to taper medications promptly [^d80d95ff] [^2ad427ca].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

Multicomponent nonpharmacologic interventions are the cornerstone of delirium management and are **strongly recommended** by guidelines [^2ad427ca] [^fdd80f81]. These interventions target modifiable risk factors and have been shown to reduce delirium incidence, duration, and severity [^88b4f4af] [^3b7a7b4f].

Key components include:

- **Reorientation and environmental modifications**: Frequent reorientation, familiar objects, clocks, calendars, and adequate lighting [^88b4f4af].

- **Sleep optimization**: Noise reduction, minimizing nighttime interruptions, and nonpharmacologic sleep aids [^88b4f4af].

- **Early mobilization**: Daily ambulation or physical therapy to prevent functional decline [^notfound].

- **Hydration and nutrition**: Ensure adequate intake and address deficiencies [^88b4f4af].

- **Sensory aids**: Provide glasses and hearing aids to reduce sensory deprivation [^88b4f4af].

- **Medication review**: Discontinue or reduce deliriogenic drugs (e.g. anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids) [^273c9d15].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions (reserved for specific indications)

Pharmacologic therapy is **not routinely recommended** and should be reserved for patients with severe agitation, psychosis, or when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^2ad427ca] [^a370aeb8]. The choice of medication depends on patient-specific factors, including age, comorbidities, and delirium subtype [^b2c15aeb].

---

### Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are the **most studied pharmacologic agents** for delirium, but evidence for their efficacy is limited and mixed [^a370aeb8] [^23bd09e2]. They may reduce agitation and psychotic symptoms but do not consistently shorten delirium duration or improve long-term outcomes [^a370aeb8] [^23bd09e2].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Haloperidol | Severe agitation, psychosis | 0.5–2 mg IV/PO q4–6h PRN | - Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - And neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^b2c15aeb] |
| Risperidone | Severe agitation, psychosis | 0.5–1 mg PO BID PRN | Lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to haloperidol [^09bca99e] |
| Olanzapine | Severe agitation, psychosis | 2.5–5 mg PO/IM daily PRN | Lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms; monitor for metabolic effects [^35b47c54] |
| Quetiapine | Severe agitation, psychosis | 25–50 mg PO BID PRN | Sedating; useful for hypoactive delirium [^notfound] |

---

Antipsychotics should be used at the **lowest effective dose**, for the shortest duration, with daily reassessment and prompt tapering once symptoms resolve [^2ad427ca] [^b2c15aeb].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are **generally avoided** due to their sedative properties and potential to worsen delirium, except in cases of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal [^066335da] [^273c9d15]. If used, short-acting agents such as lorazepam may be administered cautiously with close monitoring [^066335da].

---

### Other pharmacologic agents

- **Cholinesterase inhibitors**: Not recommended for treatment of established delirium due to lack of efficacy [^fca83f1c] [^273c9d15].
- **Dexmedetomidine**: An alpha-2 agonist primarily used in ICU settings for agitated delirium, particularly in mechanically ventilated patients. Evidence suggests it may reduce delirium duration and mechanical ventilation days, but its use is limited to ICU settings [^873ffd57] [^773fdd66].
- **Melatonin**: May be considered for prevention of delirium in high-risk patients, but evidence for treatment of established delirium is limited [^adadc8d6] [^6595f18e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring and regular reassessment are essential in managing hospital delirium. Key aspects include:

- **Vital signs and neurologic checks**: Monitor for fluctuations in mental status, autonomic instability, and adverse effects of medications [^notfound].
- **Daily reassessment**: Evaluate the need for continued pharmacologic therapy and taper or discontinue as soon as clinically feasible [^notfound].
- **Family and caregiver involvement**: Educate and engage family members in care strategies, including reorientation and environmental modifications [^372de200].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Greater susceptibility to medication side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms and falls. Use lower doses and monitor closely [^b2c15aeb].
- **Patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment**: Require individualized care plans and careful monitoring due to increased risk of persistent delirium and cognitive decline [^5e8713c1].
- **Palliative care settings**: Emphasis on comfort, symptom control, and family support. Pharmacologic therapy may be used judiciously for distressing symptoms [^dd28ecd0].

---

Hospital delirium treatment relies on **multicomponent nonpharmacologic care** as the foundation, with pharmacologic therapy reserved for severe cases. Address underlying causes, monitor closely, and reassess daily to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects [^2ad427ca] [^d80d95ff].

### Antipsychotics for treating delirium in hospitalized adults: a systematic review [^a370aeb8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with worse outcomes. Antipsychotics are commonly used; however, the associated benefits and harms are unclear.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review evaluating the benefits and harms of antipsychotics to treat delirium in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019 without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antipsychotic versus placebo or another antipsychotic, and prospective observational studies reporting harms.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data and assessed strength of evidence (SOE) for critical outcomes, with confirmation by another reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed independently by 2 reviewers.

Data Synthesis

Across 16 RCTs and 10 observational studies of hospitalized adults, there was no difference in sedation status (low and moderate SOE), delirium duration, hospital length of stay (moderate SOE), or mortality between haloperidol and second-generation antipsychotics versus placebo. There was no difference in delirium severity (moderate SOE) and cognitive functioning (low SOE) for haloperidol versus second-generation antipsychotics, with insufficient or no evidence for antipsychotics versus placebo. For direct comparisons of different second-generation antipsychotics, there was no difference in mortality and insufficient or no evidence for multiple other outcomes. There was little evidence demonstrating neurologic harms associated with short-term use of antipsychotics for treating delirium in adult inpatients, but potentially harmful cardiac effects tended to occur more frequently.

Limitations

Heterogeneity was present in terms of dose and administration route of antipsychotics, outcomes, and measurement instruments. There was insufficient or no evidence regarding multiple clinically important outcomes.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support routine use of haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotics to treat delirium in adult inpatients.

### Delirium: where do we stand? [^d9f54959]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians are likely to encounter delirium frequently, particularly in inpatient and intensive care settings. However, delirium is underrecognized and undertreated because of its heterogeneous and fluctuating presentation and due to the limitations in resources and training in contemporary clinical settings. Translation of current knowledge about delirium into clinical practice may improve patient care and benefit public health economics. Hence, this review comprehensively discusses the phenomenology and pathophysiology of delirium and its presenting features, risk factors, differential diagnoses, assessment, prognosis, and treatment with antipsychotics; the goal is to facilitate better prevention, recognition, and treatment of delirium. Available research is reviewed, limitations of the research are discussed, and future directions for further delirium research are identified.

### Antipsychotics for treatment of delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients [^23bd09e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest limited and cautious use of antipsychotics for treatment of delirium where nonpharmacological interventions have failed and symptoms remain distressing or dangerous, or both. It is unclear how well these recommendations are supported by current evidence.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to assess the efficacy of antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on the duration of delirium in hospitalised adults. Our secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of: 1) antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on delirium severity and resolution, mortality, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects; and 2) atypical vs. typical antipsychotics for reducing delirium duration, severity, and resolution, hospital mortality and length of stay, discharge disposition, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane EBM Reviews, CINAHL, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from their respective inception dates until July 2017. We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database, Web of Science ISI Proceedings, and other grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing 1) antipsychotics to nonantipsychotics or placebo and 2) typical to atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in adult hospitalised (but not critically ill) patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We examined titles and abstracts of identified studies to determine eligibility. We extracted data independently in duplicate. Disagreements were settled by further discussion and consensus. We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as a measure of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, and between-group standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine trials that recruited 727 participants. Four of the nine trials included a comparison of an antipsychotic to a nonantipsychotic drug or placebo and seven included a comparison of a typical to an atypical antipsychotic. The study populations included hospitalised medical, surgical, and palliative patients. No trial reported on duration of delirium. Antipsychotic treatment did not reduce delirium severity compared to nonantipsychotic drugs (standard mean difference (SMD) -1.08, 95% CI -2.55 to 0.39; four studies; 494 participants; very low-quality evidence); nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.02; seven studies; 542 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence antipsychotics resolved delirium symptoms compared to nonantipsychotic drug regimens (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.98; three studies; 247 participants; very low-quality evidence); nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.52; five studies; 349 participants; low-quality evidence). The pooled results indicated that antipsychotics did not alter mortality compared to nonantipsychotic regimens (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.27; three studies; 319 participants; low-quality evidence) nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.35; four studies; 342 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial reported on hospital length of stay, hospital discharge disposition, or health-related quality of life. Adverse event reporting was limited and measured with inconsistent methods; in those reporting events, the number of events were low. No trial reported on physical restraint use, long-term cognitive outcomes, cerebrovascular events, or QTc prolongation (i.e. increased time in the heart's electrical cycle). Only one trial reported on arrhythmias and seizures, with no difference between typical or atypical antipsychotics. We found antipsychotics did not have a higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) compared to nonantipsychotic drugs (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.04 to 65.57; three studies; 247 participants; very-low quality evidence); pooled results showed no increased risk of EPS with typical antipsychotics compared to atypical antipsychotics (RR 12.16, 95% CI 0.55 to 269.52; two studies; 198 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There were no reported data to determine whether antipsychotics altered the duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, discharge disposition, or health-related quality of life as studies did not report on these outcomes. From the poor quality data available, we found antipsychotics did not reduce delirium severity, resolve symptoms, or alter mortality. Adverse effects were poorly or rarely reported in the trials. Extrapyramidal symptoms were not more frequent with antipsychotics compared to nonantipsychotic drug regimens, and no different for typical compared to atypical antipsychotics.

### Delirium in hospitalized patients: implications of current evidence on clinical practice and future avenues for research – a systematic evidence review [^9df9f601]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the significant burden of delirium among hospitalized adults, critical appraisal of systematic data on delirium diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, prevention, and outcomes is lacking.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations for delirium care to practitioners, and identify gaps in delirium research.

Data Sources

Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) information systems from January 1966 to April 2011.

Study Selection

All published systematic evidence reviews (SERs) on delirium were evaluated.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently extracted the data regarding delirium risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes, and critically appraised each SER as good, fair, or poor using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-two SERs graded as good or fair provided the data. Age, cognitive impairment, depression, anticholinergic drugs, and lorazepam use were associated with an increased risk for developing delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is reliable for delirium diagnosis outside of the intensive care unit. Multicomponent nonpharmacological interventions are effective in reducing delirium incidence in elderly medical patients. Low-dose haloperidol has similar efficacy as atypical antipsychotics for treating delirium. Delirium is associated with poor outcomes independent of age, severity of illness, or dementia.

Conclusion

Delirium is an acute, preventable medical condition with short- and long-term negative effects on a patient's cognitive and functional states.

### Antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium in older hospitalized adults: a systematic review [^e78b4ce2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine evidence of the efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium in older hospitalized adults.

Design

Systematic literature review.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

Older adults with delirium.

Measurements

The MEDLINE (January 1980-December 2010) and Cochrane Databases were searched using the keywords "delirium" and "antipsychotics". References of review articles were reviewed to identify additional studies. Study selection criteria included prospective design, more than 10 participants (in treatment arms), mean age 60 and older, standardized criteria for diagnosing delirium, and validated delirium rating scales for reporting outcomes.

Results

Thirteen articles met selection criteria: six single-agent and seven comparison studies. Of these, eight (62%) had fewer than 25 participants in treatment arms, 10 (77%) recruited participants from psychiatry referrals, and eight (62%) did not clearly describe their screening methods. All single-agent studies were open-label studies. Of the comparison studies, five (71%) used randomization, but only one of these (a placebo-controlled study) used adequate allocation concealment methods, and only one other study (comparing two antipsychotics) described a double-blind method in detail. In the only placebo-controlled study (which was stopped early), no statistically significant differences in mean delirium severity scores were found at individual time points (Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10). The other 12 studies reported improvements in delirium severity or resolution of delirium based on cutoff scores of the scales, but it is not clear from any of these studies what the natural course of delirium would have been without use of antipsychotics.

Conclusion

Because of severe methodological limitations, the studies in this review do not support the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium in older hospitalized adults. Additional well-designed randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed.

### Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in critically ill adults [^873ffd57]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short-term and long-term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population.

Objectives

Primary objective1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of deliriumSecondary objectivesTo assess the following:1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium-free and coma-free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and long-term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health-related quality of life); and2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or high-dependency unit.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high.

Main Results

We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo-controlled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha 2 agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non-pharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate-quality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderate-quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; very-low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high-quality evidence). The NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderate-quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pair-wise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha 2 agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of delirium-free and coma-free days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, long-term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review.

METHODS

Protocol and registration

The study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42020169654).

Eligibility criteria

Study characteristics

To capture a broad scope of studies in the literature, we included studies where assessment started in the ED. We considered studies that evaluated interventions for the prevention or treatment of delirium in older adults admitted from the ED. We excluded studies that did not include ED or focused entirely on delirium tremens or emergence delirium, as these conditions are pathophysiologically distinct from the geriatric syndrome of delirium.

Types of studies

This review included randomized controlled trials (RCT), before and after studies, observational studies with statistical adjustment, and quality improvement studies. We did not exclude any study based on language.

Types of participants

For treatment studies, we included studies with participants 65 years of age or older who screened positive for delirium. For prevention studies, we included studies with participants 65 years of age or older who screened negative or did not get a diagnosis for delirium on ED presentation. We chose 65 as the relative cutoff as the risk of delirium is the highest in this age group.

Types of interventions

Any interventions that were quantitatively evaluated as delirium prevention or treatment were eligible. "Prevention" included any approach to reduce incident delirium during the ED episode of care or subsequent hospitalization for those admitted. "Treatment" included any method used to reduce the severity and/or duration of those diagnosed with delirium. The comparator group was the placebo, usual care, or pre‐ implementation baseline.

Types of outcome measures

For prevention studies, the primary outcome was delirium incidence or inpatient delirium prevalence, and delirium severity was the primary outcome for treatment studies. Secondary outcomes include delirium duration and mortality rates. Delirium identification required the use of valid delirium assessment tools or clinical diagnosis. This included brief screening tools and diagnosis codes. Delirium duration was typically reported in consecutive days that a patient had a positive screen for delirium or met diagnostic criteria for delirium. The timing parameters spanned the initial arrival in the ED and the entire hospital stay.

### Antipsychotic medication for prevention and treatment of delirium in hospitalized adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^22519555]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of antipsychotic medications in preventing and treating delirium.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from January 1, 1988, to November 26, 2013.

Participants

Adult surgical and medical inpatients.

Intervention

Antipsychotic administration for delirium prevention or treatment in randomized controlled trials or cohort studies.

Measurements

Two authors independently reviewed all citations, extracted relevant data, and assessed studies for potential bias. Heterogeneity was considered as chi-square P < .1 or I² > 50%. Using a random-effects model (I² > 50%) or a fixed-effects model (I² < 50%), odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes (delirium incidence and mortality), and mean or standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes (delirium duration, severity, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS)). Sensitivity analyses included postoperative prevention studies only, exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, and typical versus atypical antipsychotics.

Results

Screening of 10,877 eligible records identified 19 studies. In seven studies comparing antipsychotics with placebo or no treatment for delirium prevention after surgery, there was no significant effect on delirium incidence (OR = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23–1.34, I(2) = 93%). Using data reported from all 19 studies, antipsychotic use was not associated with change in delirium duration, severity, or hospital or ICU LOS, with high heterogeneity among studies. No association with mortality was detected (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.62–1.29, I(2) = 0%).

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support the use of antipsychotics for prevention or treatment of delirium. Additional methodologically rigorous studies using standardized outcome measures are needed.

### A core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent and / or treat delirium for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission: an international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^421c0675]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Adults requiring admission to an acute care hospital who are at risk of delirium comprise a heterogeneous group including those undergoing major surgery, older adults with non-surgical indications for acute hospital admission such as pneumonia and urosepsis, and in recent times the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Delirium is a syndrome characterized by fluctuating mental status with marked inattention and other cognitive disturbance that is attributable to one or more etiologies. Post-operative delirium is a common complication, with prevalence as high as 50% depending on surgery type and patient risk. Among older adults admitted to an acute care hospital ward, 1 in 5 experience delirium.

The consequences of delirium are serious and include neurocognitive disturbance and cognitive decline, prolonged hospitalization, discharge to post-acute care facilities, increased caregiver burden, decreased functional status, adverse events such as falls, and mortality. As delirium persists, the risk of mortality at 6 months increases. Many patients whose hospitalization is complicated by delirium never return to baseline functional status. Delirium poses substantial additional costs to healthcare systems; with US healthcare costs attributable to delirium estimated to exceed $182 billion annually.

While strong evidence indicates delirium is partially preventable through multi-component nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacological prevention or treatment strategies have yet to be proven effective. Disparate outcome selection in trials evaluating the same intervention is an important barrier to effectively synthesizing study results, precluding the ability to developing evidence-based practices and policies. Core outcomes sets (COS) are an agreed-upon minimum set of outcomes to be measured and reported in all studies relating to a specific health condition. COS offer a solution to reducing heterogeneity of trial outcome selection. Therefore, our objective was to undertake a rigorous international consensus process for a COS for trials of interventions, designed to prevent and/or treat delirium, for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission, but who do not require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We elected to develop a single COS for prevention and treatment trials as many evaluate an intervention as a continuum of prevention to treatment, particularly in participant groups (those receiving anesthesia or sedation, or those with concomitant cognitive issues) in whom early confirmation of delirium is challenging. We excluded trials conducted in the ICU in this COS as we hypothesized outcomes specific to critically ill patients such as ventilation duration might be considered important.

### A core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent and / or treat delirium for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission: an international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^b39f6158]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With development of this COS, we seek to promote standardized outcome selection and reporting in future trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in adults experiencing an acute care hospital admission and without an ICU admission. We anticipate widespread dissemination and adoption of this COS will facilitate faster detection of effective interventions to prevent or treat delirium due to enhanced ability to pool trial data, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Further work is now needed to operationally define the six core outcomes that will include consensus in selecting validated measurement instruments, the time horizon for measurement, analysis metrics, and method of aggregation.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients [^88b4f4af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non-pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non-pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full-text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre-specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between-group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta-analysis fixed-effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non-pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain. Pooled data showed that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I² = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias). There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I² = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision). No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) -0.93, 95% CI -2.01 to 0.14 days, I² = 65%; 351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.14, I² = 64%; 147 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD -1.30 days, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.04 days, I² = 91%; 3351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited. Our exploratory component network meta-analysis found that re-orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm. Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial. Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I² = 9%; 294 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias). Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.

### Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients [^6595f18e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common mental disorder, which is distressing and has serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. Prevention of delirium is desirable from the perspective of patients and carers, and healthcare providers. It is currently unclear, however, whether interventions for preventing delirium are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 4 December 2015 for all randomised studies on preventing delirium. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Central (The Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science core collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO meta register of trials, ICTRP.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multi- component non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data independently, with any disagreements settled by consensus. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration and severity of delirium, institutional care at discharge, quality of life and healthcare costs. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and standard deviations for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We included 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants, assessing 22 different interventions or comparisons. Fourteen trials were placebo-controlled, 15 evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care, and 10 compared two different interventions. Thirty-two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery, the majority in orthopaedic settings. Seven studies were conducted in general medical or geriatric medicine settings. We found multi-component interventions reduced the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; seven studies; 1950 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Effect sizes were similar in medical (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92; four studies; 1365 participants) and surgical settings (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; three studies; 585 participants). In the subgroup of patients with pre-existing dementia, the effect of multi-component interventions remains uncertain (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36; one study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence). There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in preventing delirium compared to placebo (RR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.17 to 2.62; two studies, 113 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three trials provide no clear evidence of an effect of antipsychotic medications as a group on the incidence of delirium (RR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.59; 916 participants; very low-quality evidence). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis there was no evidence for effectiveness of a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.60; two studies; 516 participants, low-quality evidence). However, delirium incidence was lower (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52; one study; 400 participants, moderate-quality evidence) for patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence). There is no clear evidence that melatonin or melatonin agonists reduce delirium incidence compared to placebo (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.89; three studies, 529 participants; low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia reduces the incidence of delirium compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia or clinical judgement (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; two studies; 2057 participants). It is not possible to generate robust evidence statements for a range of additional pharmacological and anaesthetic interventions due to small numbers of trials, of variable methodological quality.

Authors' Conclusions

There is strong evidence supporting multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic medication or melatonin reduce the incidence of delirium. Using the Bispectral Index to monitor and control depth of anaesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. The role of drugs and other anaesthetic techniques to prevent delirium remains uncertain.

### Multidisciplinary team interventions for delirium in patients with chronic cognitive impairment [^4d1938a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is common in hospitalized elderly people. Delirium may affect 60% of frail elderly people in hospital. Among the cognitively impaired, 45% have been found to develop delirium and these patients have longer lengths of hospital stay and a higher rate of complications which, with other factors, increase costs of care. The management of delirium has commonly been multifaceted, the primary emphasis has to be on the diagnosis and therapy of precipitating factors, but as these may not be immediately resolved, symptomatic and supportive care are also of major importance.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess the available evidence for the effectiveness, if any, of multidisciplinary team interventions in the coordinated care of elderly patients with delirium superimposed on an underlying chronic cognitive impairment in comparison with usual care.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 3 July 2003 using the terms delirium and confus*. The Register is regularly updated and contains records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Selection for possible inclusion in this review was made on the basis of the research methodology - controlled trials whose participants are reported as having chronic cognitive impairment, and who then developed incident delirium and were randomly assigned to either coordinated multidisciplinary care or usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine controlled trials were identified for possible inclusion in the review, only one of which met the inclusion criteria. At present the data from that study cannot be analysed. We have requested additional data from the authors and are awaiting their reply.

Main Results

No studies focused on patients with prior cognitive impairment, so management of delirium in this group could not be assessed. There is very little information on the management of delirium in the literature despite an increasing body of information about the incidence, risks and prognosis of the disorder in the elderly population.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The management of delirium needs to be studied in a more clearly defined way before evidence-based guidelines can be developed. Insufficient data are available for the development of evidence-based guidelines on diagnosis or management. There is scope for research in all areas - from basic pathophysiology and epidemiology to prevention and management. Though much recent research has focused on the problem of delirium, the evidence is still difficult to utilize in management programmes. Research needs to be undertaken targeting specific groups known to be at high risk of developing delirium, for example the cognitively impaired and the frail elderly. As has been highlighted by Inouye 1999, delirium has very important economic and health policy implications and is a clinical problem that can affect all aspects of care of an ill older person. Delirium, though a frequent problem in hospitalized elderly patients, is still managed empirically and there is no evidence in the literature to support change to current practice at this time.

### Predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium: a systematic review [^5e8713c1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute and often fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness that is extremely common among hospitalized older adults, with an incidence of 29% to 64% in general medical wards, 50% after high-risk surgical procedures, and up to 75% in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Delirium is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased risk of falls, functional decline, dementia, prolonged hospitalization, institutionalization, and death, at an annual cost of $38 billion to $152 billion in the US.

Heterogeneous delirium phenotypes and the many predisposing factors, precipitants, and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with delirium make this condition challenging to identify, manage, and study. Despite its heterogeneous etiologies, delirium remains a blanket diagnosis, so it is unsurprising that treatment trials to address delirium of all causes have largely been ineffective. The understanding of delirium etiology is a major unmet need. Currently, there is no consistently used comprehensive framework for categorizing delirium etiologies, although multiple models have been proposed.,

While the heterogeneity of the literature on risk factors associated with delirium precludes a meta-analysis, this systematic review aimed to identify potential predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium across all clinical settings and patient populations to provide the basis for a framework for standardizing delirium classification into major pathophysiological categories. We believe this foundation may be necessary to develop a precision medicine approach to delirium in which etiology and pathophysiology inform research and therapeutic strategies.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^9ead1170]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common, acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness, attention and cognition. Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable, with estimates suggesting that 30–50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) may experience delirium. Delirium is a serious condition with deleterious effects on patient-important outcomes. Studies have associated delirium with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU stay, increased cognitive impairment and disability 1-year after hospital discharge. Delirium has also been associated with increased mortality with longer episodes of delirium translating into higher mortality risk.

Currently, no evidence-based pharmacological treatment exists for delirium, and guidelines do not support the routine use of any pharmacological agent for its prevention or treatment. However, in clinical settings, patients with delirium are often treated with various agents, including antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, benzodiazepines, opioids, sedatives and others. Among these agents, haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic compound, is the most frequently used agent to treat delirium in the ICU. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted that the evidence for the use of haloperidol in critically ill patients with delirium was sparse and inconclusive. Since then, new randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have been published, necessitating an updated systematic review, summarising the available evidence on the effects of haloperidol in critically ill patients with delirium.

The aim of this study was to assess patient-important benefits and harms of haloperidol versus placebo or any comparator in critically ill patients with delirium. The primary comparison was haloperidol versus placebo.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adults [^dd28ecd0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute disturbance of attention and awareness which develops over a short time period and fluctuates in severity over the course of the day. It is commonly experienced during inpatient admission in the terminal phase of illness. It can cause symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations and is distressing for terminally ill people, their families and staff. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should aim to address these causes. When this is not possible, or treatment is unsuccessful, drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is the second update of the review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies to manage delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019, reference lists of retrieved papers, and online trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of drug therapies in any dose by any route, compared to another drug therapy, a non-pharmacological approach, placebo, standard care or wait-list control, for the management of delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults (18 years or older).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were delirium symptoms; agitation score; adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: use of rescue medication; cognitive status; survival. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome and we include eight 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four studies (three new to this update), with 399 participants. Most participants had advanced cancer or advanced AIDS, and mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Meta-analysis was not possible because no two studies examined the same comparison. Each study was at high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Most evidence was low to very low quality, downgraded due to very serious study limitations, imprecision or because there were so few data. Most studies reported delirium symptoms; two reported agitation scores; three reported adverse events with data on extrapyramidal effects; and none reported serious adverse events. 1. Haloperidol versus placebo There may be little to no difference between placebo and haloperidol in delirium symptoms within 24 hours (mean difference (MD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.75; 133 participants). Haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo at 48 hours (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol may reduce agitation slightly compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.14, 95% -0.28 to -0.00; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol probably increases extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.41; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 2. Haloperidol versus risperidone There may be little to no difference in delirium symptoms with haloperidol compared with risperidone within 24 hours (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.06; 126 participants) or 48 hours (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.20; 106 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 3. Haloperidol versus olanzapine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with olanzapine within 24 hours (MD 2.36, 95% CI -0.75 to 5.47; 28 participants) or 48 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI -1.50 to 5.30, 24 participants). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 4. Risperidone versus placebo Risperidone may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo within 24 hours (MD 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.22; 129 participants); and at 48 hours (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.38; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). There may be little to no difference in agitation with risperidone compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.09; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Risperidone may increase extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.73 95% CI 0.09 to 1.37; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 5. Lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol We are uncertain whether lorazepam plus haloperidol compared with placebo plus haloperidol improves delirium symptoms within 24 hours (MD 2.10, 95% CI -1.00 to 5.20; 50 participants with moderate to severe delirium), reduces agitation within 24 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.80; 52 participants), or increases adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.63; 31 participants with moderate to severe delirium). 6. Haloperidol versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 0.37, 95% CI -4.58 to 5.32; 24 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with chlorpromazine (MD 0.46, 95% CI -4.22 to 5.14; 24 participants). 7. Haloperidol versus lorazepam We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with lorazepam at 48 hours (MD -4.88, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.06; 17 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with lorazepam (MD -6.66, 95% CI -14.85 to 1.53; 17 participants). 8. Lorazepam versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether lorazepam reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 5.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.12; 19 participants), or increases adverse events (MD 7.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.32; 18 participants). Agitation scores were not reported.

Secondary Outcomes

use of rescue medication, cognitive impairment, survival There were insufficient data to draw conclusions or assess GRADE.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of drug therapy for delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. We found low-quality evidence that risperidone or haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms of mild to moderate severity for terminally ill people compared with placebo. We found moderate- to low-quality evidence that haloperidol and risperidone may slightly increase extrapyramidal adverse events for people with mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Given the small number of studies and participants on which current evidence is based, further research is essential.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^09c0a583]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Haloperidol is frequently used in critically ill patients with delirium, but evidence for its effects has been sparse and inconclusive. By including recent trials, we updated a systematic review assessing effects of haloperidol on mortality and serious adverse events in critically ill patients with delirium.

Methods

This is an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised clinical trials investigating haloperidol versus placebo or any comparator in critically ill patients with delirium. We adhered to the Cochrane handbook, the PRISMA guidelines and the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation statements. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and proportion of patients with one or more serious adverse events or reactions (SAEs/SARs). Secondary outcomes were days alive without delirium or coma, delirium severity, cognitive function and health-related quality of life.

Results

We included 11 RCTs with 15 comparisons (n = 2200); five were placebo-controlled. The relative risk for mortality with haloperidol versus placebo was 0.89; 96.7% CI 0.77 to 1.03; I² = 0% (moderate-certainty evidence) and for proportion of patients experiencing SAEs/SARs 0.94; 96.7% CI 0.81 to 1.10; I² = 18% (low-certainty evidence). We found no difference in days alive without delirium or coma (moderate-certainty evidence). We found sparse data for other secondary outcomes and other comparators than placebo.

Conclusions

Haloperidol may reduce mortality and likely result in little to no change in the occurrence of SAEs/SARs compared with placebo in critically ill patients with delirium. However, the results were not statistically significant and more trial data are needed to provide higher certainty for the effects of haloperidol in these patients.

### How we prevent and treat delirium in the ICU [^372de200]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Delirium is a serious and complex problem facing critically ill patients, their families, and the health care system. When delirium develops, it is associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased costs, and long-term cognitive impairment in many patients. This article uses a clinical case to discuss our approach to delirium prevention and treatment in the ICU. We believe that an effective strategy to combat delirium requires implementation and adherence to a pain and sedation protocol as part of bundled care, use of a validated tool to detect delirium when present, and a focus on nonpharmacologic care strategies, including reorientation, early mobility, and incorporating family into care when possible. At present, the evidence does not support the routine administration of medications to prevent or treat delirium. A pharmacologic approach may be needed for agitated delirium, and we discuss our evaluation of the evidence for and against particular medications. Although delirium can be a distressing problem, there is evidence that it can be addressed through careful attention to prevention, detection, and minimizing the long-term impact on patients and their families.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^066335da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

### Non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions preventing delirium in hospitalized people [^3b7a7b4f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Delirium is a common neurobehavioral complication in hospitalized patients with a high prevalence in various clinical settings. Prevention of delirium is critical due to its common occurrence and associated poor outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in hospitalized patients at risk.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

We included a study if it was a randomized controlled trial and was evaluating effects of coordinated non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions in the prevention of delirium.

Measurements

We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and CENTRAL (PROSPERO: CRD42019138981; last update May 24, 2019). We assessed the quality of included studies by using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. We extracted the measured outcomes for delirium incidence, duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, falls during hospital stay, discharge to institutional care, and inpatient mortality.

Results

In total, we screened 1,027 eligible records and included eight studies with 2,105 patients in the review. We found evidence of an effect (ie, reduction) of multicomponent interventions on the incidence of delirium (risk ratio = .53; 95% confidence interval = .41-.69; I² = 0). We detected no clear evidence of an effect for delirium duration, length of hospital stay, accidental falls, and mortality. Subgroup analyses did not result in findings of substantial effect modifiers, which can be explained by the high homogeneity within studies.

Conclusion

Our findings confirm the current guidelines that multicomponent interventions are effective in preventing delirium. Data are still lacking to reach evidence-based conclusions concerning potential benefits for hard outcomes such as length of hospital stay, return to independent living, and mortality. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1864–1871, 2020.

### Delirium [^d80d95ff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Delirium is an acute confusional state that is common and costly and is associated with significant functional decline and distress. It is the manifestation of acute encephalopathy and is variably called acute brain failure, acute brain dysfunction, or altered mental status. All patients are at risk for delirium, although those with more vulnerabilities (such as advanced age, exposures to other stressors like infection, and certain medications) are at higher risk. The pathophysiologic cause of delirium is not well understood. It is important to recognize patients at risk for and those with delirium and to immediately identify and treat factors contributing to it. There is no single intervention or medication to treat delirium, making it challenging to manage. Therefore, risk mitigation and prompt treatment rely on a sophisticated strategy to address the contributing factors. Delirium may be prevented or attenuated when multimodal strategies are used, thereby improving patient outcomes.

### Antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^253902e1]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing whether the use of antipsychotic medications in critically ill adult patients with delirium impacts patient-important outcomes.

Data Sources

A medical librarian searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, and Wiley's Cochrane Library as well as clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to November 2023.

Study Selection

Independently and in duplicate, reviewers screened abstracts and titles for eligibility, then full text of qualifying studies. We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included critically ill adult patients with delirium. The intervention group was required to receive antipsychotic medications at any dose, whereas the control group received usual care or placebo.

Data Extraction

Reviewers extracted data independently and in duplicate using a piloted abstraction form. Statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan software (version 5.4).

Data Synthesis

Five RCTs (n = 1750) met eligibility criteria. The use of antipsychotic medications compared with placebo did not increase the number of delirium- or coma-free days (mean difference 0.90 d; 95% CI, -0.32 to 2.12; moderate certainty), nor did it result in a difference in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU, or hospital length of stay. The use of antipsychotics did not result in an increased risk of adverse events (risk ratio 1.27; 95% CI, 0.71–2.30; high certainty). Subgroup analysis of typical versus atypical antipsychotics did not identify any subgroup effect for any outcome.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated with moderate certainty that there is no difference in delirium- or coma-free days when delirious critically ill adults are treated with antipsychotic medications. Further studies in the subset of patients with hyperactive delirium may be of benefit.

### Delirium in older persons: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^2ad427ca]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Delirium is defined as an acute disorder of attention and cognition. It is a common, serious, and often fatal condition among older patients. Although often underrecognized, delirium has serious adverse effects on the individual's function and quality of life, as well as broad societal effects with substantial health care costs.

Objective

To summarize the current state of the art in diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to highlight critical areas for future research to advance the field.

Evidence Review

Search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for the past 6 years, from January 1, 2011, until March 16, 2017, using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms. Since delirium is more prevalent in older adults, the focus was on studies in elderly populations; studies based solely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-English-language articles were excluded.

Findings

Of 127 articles included, 25 were clinical trials, 42 cohort studies, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 55 were other categories. A total of 11 616 patients were represented in the treatment studies. Advances in diagnosis have included the development of brief screening tools with high sensitivity and specificity, such as the 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment; 4 A's Test; and proxy-based measures such as the Family Confusion Assessment Method. Measures of severity, such as the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity Score, can aid in monitoring response to treatment, risk stratification, and assessing prognosis. Nonpharmacologic approaches focused on risk factors such as immobility, functional decline, visual or hearing impairment, dehydration, and sleep deprivation are effective for delirium prevention and also are recommended for delirium treatment. Current recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of delirium, based on recent reviews of the evidence, recommend reserving use of antipsychotics and other sedating medications for treatment of severe agitation that poses risk to patient or staff safety or threatens interruption of essential medical therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances in diagnosis can improve recognition and risk stratification of delirium. Prevention of delirium using nonpharmacologic approaches is documented to be effective, while pharmacologic prevention and treatment of delirium remains controversial.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for delirium prevention: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^33671b59]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Delirium is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients, particularly in older adults, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) have been proposed as potential agents to reduce occurrence and severity of delirium. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of AChEIs for both prophylaxis and treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024563798).

Study Selection

Studies comparing AChEIs and placebo for delirium in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction

The main outcome of interest was delirium occurrence, while secondary outcomes included duration, severity, and hospital length of stay (LOS).

Data Synthesis

Subgroup analyses were performed based on prophylaxis or treatment of delirium. Statistical analysis was performed in RStudio 4.4.0 with a random effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed with I2. Risk of Bias 2 was used for bias assessment. We screened 1306 records and included ten studies: eight studies focusing on prophylaxis after surgery and two on treatment of established delirium. A total of 731 patients were analyzed: 365 in the AChEIs group and 366 in the placebo group. AChEIs significantly reduced delirium occurrence (risk ratio = 0.68 [0.47–0.98]; p = 0.039). No significant effects were observed for delirium duration (mean difference [MD] = -0.16 d [-0.9 to 0.62 d]; p = 0.23), delirium severity (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.08 [-0.58 to 0.41]; p = 0.74), or LOS (MD = -0.82 d [-2.03 to 0.40 d]; p = 0.19). Subgroup analysis showed a tendency for better outcomes when AChEIs were used as prophylaxis, with a significant reduction in delirium duration in this subgroup (SMD = -0.32 [-0.56 to -0.07]; p < 0.01). No significant differences in adverse events were identified.

Conclusions

AChEIs are effective in reducing occurrence of delirium when used prophylactically in patients undergoing elective surgery. AChEIs did not significantly impact on delirium duration, severity, or hospital LOS. Further studies are needed to explore the potential benefits or harms of AChEIs in different patient populations and settings.

### Delirium in elderly adults: diagnosis, prevention and treatment [^a04ba475]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Delirium is a common and serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. The etiologies of delirium are diverse and multifactorial and often reflect the pathophysiological consequences of an acute medical illness, medical complication or drug intoxication. Delirium can have a widely variable presentation, and is often missed and underdiagnosed as a result. At present, the diagnosis of delirium is clinically based and depends on the presence or absence of certain features. Management strategies for delirium are focused on prevention and symptom management. This article reviews current clinical practice in delirium in elderly individuals, including the diagnosis, treatment, outcomes and economic impact of this syndrome. Areas of future research are also discussed.

### Delirium and COVID-19: a narrative review of emerging evidence [^720f4855]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Delirium is a common condition affecting hospital inpatients, including those having surgery and on the intensive care unit. Delirium is also common in patients with COVID-19 in hospital settings, and the occurrence is higher than expected for similar infections. The short-term outcomes of those with COVID-19 delirium are similar to that of classical delirium and include increased length of stay and increased mortality. Management of delirium in COVID-19 in the context of a global pandemic is limited by the severity of the syndrome and compounded by the environmental constraints. Practical management includes effective screening, early identification and appropriate treatment aimed at minimising complications and timely escalation decisions. The pandemic has played out on the national stage and the effect of delirium on patients, relatives and healthcare workers remains unknown but evidence from the previous SARS outbreak suggests there may be long-lasting psychological damage.

### Clinical practice guidelines for delirium management: potential application in palliative care [^198fb5a2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Delirium occurs in patients across a wide array of health care settings. The extent to which formal management guidelines exist or are adaptable to palliative care is unclear.

Objectives

This review aims to 1) source published delirium management guidelines with potential relevance to palliative care settings, 2) discuss the process of guideline development, 3) appraise their clinical utility, and 4) outline the processes of their implementation and evaluation and make recommendations for future guideline development.

Methods

We searched PubMed (1990–2013), Scopus, U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google, and relevant reference lists to identify published guidelines for the management of delirium. This was supplemented with multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other relevant stakeholders at an international delirium study planning meeting.

Results

There is a paucity of high-level evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in the management of delirium in palliative care. However, multiple delirium guidelines for clinical practice have been developed, with recommendations derived from "expert opinion" for areas where research evidence is lacking. In addition to their potential benefits, limitations of clinical guidelines warrant consideration. Guidelines should be appraised and then adapted for use in a particular setting before implementation. Further research is needed on the evaluation of guidelines, as disseminated and implemented in a clinical setting, focusing on measurable outcomes in addition to their impact on quality of care.

Conclusion

Delirium clinical guidelines are available but the level of evidence is limited. More robust evidence is required for future guideline development.

### More questions than answers in ICU delirium: pressing issues for future research [^5566585e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

With the release of the updated pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, a number of new and updated recommendations are provided regarding the pharmacological prevention and treatment of ICU delirium. Whereas this is important to understand the limitations of existing literature in interpreting the guideline recommendations, it also provides an opportunity to identify those areas of practice where we need further knowledge. We discuss 5 of the most critical questions in our view regarding pharmacological therapy for ICU delirium in an attempt to highlight areas of this ICU condition that are much deserving of further research, including the deliriogenic potential of dexmedetomidine, optimal sedative choices for the delirious ICU patient, pharmacological prophylaxis for ICU delirium, optimal treatment duration for ICU delirium, and the impact of pharmacotherapy on long-term cognitive outcomes in ICU survivors. A multitude of opportunities for further research exist in the above areas for clinicians and researchers interested in this ICU condition.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^ec85f38e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for clinical practice and perspectives

A high number of critically ill patients develop delirium and haloperidol is still the most used pharmacological intervention. The summarised evidence in this review indicates possible benefit on mortality and SAE/SAR, although uncertainty remains. A recent Bayesian analysis of the largest RCT included in this review, the AID-ICU trial, found high probability of benefit and low probability of harm on reported outcomes, most importantly 94% probability of a clinically important benefit (2% risk difference or more) on mortality. Taken together, the available evidence does not indicate harm of haloperidol treatment, and it may be beneficial in critically ill adult patients with delirium. Moreover, it is currently the best studied antipsychotic in this population. Consequently, if strategies of prevention and non-pharmacological interventions fails, haloperidol is possibly a beneficial agent to use if pharmacological interventions are needed for the treatment of delirium. This statement is given as haloperidol is already frequently used in clinical practice, is well known to health-care personnel, and is easy to use and titrate.

Strengths and limitations

We adhered to the Cochrane handbook, the PRISMA and the GRADE approach. We published the protocol and updated the protocol registration in PROSPERO before conducting the literature search for this updated systematic review. We used the RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias at outcome level. We used TSA to minimise the risk of random errors due to sparse data and multiple outcomes.

This systematic review also has limitations. First, five placebo-controlled trials provided data for our primary outcomes, but we still do not have sufficient data to firmly detect or reject a 20% relative change for our primary outcomes. Data were increasingly sparse for other comparators than placebo.

Second, a considerable number of trials reported exposure to open-label antipsychotics which may have contaminated the placebo group with antipsychotics and driven a potential intervention effect towards null. Third, we included trials randomising patients with diagnosed delirium and excluded trials randomising patients at high risk of delirium. We believe this is reasonable as we aim to examine the effect of treatment of delirium and not prevention, but with this approach, we may have lost information and power from these trials. Fourth none of the included trials reported on health-related quality of life or cognitive function. Both outcomes are highly patient-important and should be included in future trials as described in the core outcome set for delirium in critically ill patients. Fifth, we planned to examine clinical heterogeneity by performing pre-defined subgroups, but data were not available to conduct such analyses.

### Treating an established episode of delirium in palliative care: expert opinion and review of the current evidence base with recommendations for future development [^e3a80018]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Delirium is a highly prevalent complication in patients in palliative care settings, especially in the end-of-life context.

Objectives

To review the current evidence base for treating episodes of delirium in palliative care settings and propose a framework for future development.

Methods

We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other purposely selected stakeholders at an international delirium study planning meeting. This was supplemented by a literature search of multiple databases and relevant reference lists to identify studies regarding therapeutic interventions for delirium.

Results

The context of delirium management in palliative care is highly variable. The standard management of a delirium episode includes the investigation of precipitating and aggravating factors followed by symptomatic treatment with drug therapy. However, the intensity of this management depends on illness trajectory and goals of care in addition to the local availability of both investigative modalities and therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologically, haloperidol remains the practice standard by consensus for symptomatic control. Dosing schedules are derived from expert opinion and various clinical practice guidelines as evidence-based data from palliative care settings are limited. The commonly used pharmacologic interventions for delirium in this population warrant evaluation in clinical trials to examine dosing and titration regimens, different routes of administration, and safety and efficacy compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Delirium treatment is multidimensional and includes the identification of precipitating and aggravating factors. For symptomatic management, haloperidol remains the practice standard. Further high-quality collaborative research investigating the appropriate treatment of this complex syndrome is needed.

### Antipsychotics for preventing delirium in hospitalized adults: a systematic review [^f0a96a08]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an acute disorder marked by impairments in attention and cognition, caused by an underlying medical problem. Antipsychotics are used to prevent delirium, but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review evaluating the benefits and harms of antipsychotics for prevention of delirium in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception through July 2019, without restrictions based on study setting, language of publication, or length of follow-up.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an antipsychotic with placebo or another antipsychotic, and prospective observational studies with a comparison group.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data and graded the strength of the evidence, and a second reviewer confirmed the data. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

A total of 14 RCTs were included. There were no differences in delirium incidence or duration, hospital length of stay (high strength of evidence [SOE]), and mortality between haloperidol and placebo used for delirium prevention. Little to no evidence was found to determine the effect of haloperidol on cognitive function, delirium severity (insufficient SOE), inappropriate continuation, and sedation (insufficient SOE). There is limited evidence that second-generation antipsychotics may lower delirium incidence in the postoperative setting. There is little evidence that short-term use of antipsychotics was associated with neurologic harms. In some of the trials, potentially harmful cardiac effects occurred more frequently with antipsychotic use.

Limitations

There was significant heterogeneity in antipsychotic dosing, route of antipsychotic administration, assessment of outcomes, and adverse events. There were insufficient or no data available to draw conclusions for many of the outcomes.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support routine use of haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotics for prevention of delirium. There is limited evidence that second-generation antipsychotics may lower the incidence of delirium in postoperative patients, but more research is needed. Future trials should use standardized outcome measures.

### Delirium in the elderly [^7aa79bda]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Delirium is defined as an acute disturbance in attention and cognition, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. This article discusses the basic epidemiology of delirium and approaches to diagnosing, assessing, and working up patients for delirium. It delineates the pathophysiology and underlying predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium. It also discusses recent advances in prevention and treatment, particularly multicomponent, nonpharmacological interventions.

### A core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent and / or treat delirium for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission: an international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^63a77b5d]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Trials of interventions to prevent or treat delirium in adults in an acute hospital setting report heterogeneous outcomes. Our objective was to develop international consensus among key stakeholders for a core outcome set (COS) for future trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in adults with an acute care hospital admission and not admitted to an intensive care unit.

Methods

A rigorous COS development process was used including a systematic review, qualitative interviews, modified Delphi consensus process, and in-person consensus using nominal group technique (registration http://www.comet - initiative.org/studies/details/796). Participants in qualitative interviews were delirium survivors or family members. Participants in consensus methods comprised international representatives from three stakeholder groups: researchers, clinicians, and delirium survivors and family members.

Results

Item generation identified 8 delirium-specific outcomes and 71 other outcomes from 183 studies, and 30 outcomes from 18 qualitative interviews, including 2 that were not extracted from the systematic review. De-duplication of outcomes and formal consensus processes involving 110 experts including researchers (N = 32), clinicians (N = 63), and delirium survivors and family members (N = 15) resulted in a COS comprising 6 outcomes: delirium occurrence and reoccurrence, delirium severity, delirium duration, cognition, emotional distress, and health-related quality of life. Study limitations included exclusion of non-English studies and stakeholders and small representation of delirium survivors/family at the in-person consensus meeting.

Conclusions

This COS, endorsed by the American and Australian Delirium Societies and European Delirium Association, is recommended for future clinical trials evaluating delirium prevention or treatment interventions in adults presenting to an acute care hospital and not admitted to an intensive care unit.

### Delirium in the intensive care unit [^0b1244c1]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Delirium, an acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness and cognition, is a common manifestation of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients, occurring in up to 80% of the sickest intensive care unit (ICU) populations. Critically ill patients are subject to numerous risk factors for delirium. Some of these, such as exposure to sedative and analgesic medications, may be modified to reduce risk. Although dysfunction of other organ systems continues to receive more clinical attention, delirium is now recognized to be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the ICU, and it is recommended that all ICU patients be monitored using a validated delirium assessment instrument. Patients with delirium have longer hospital stays and lower 6-month survival than do patients without delirium, and preliminary research suggests that delirium may be associated with cognitive impairment that persists months to years after discharge. Little evidence exists regarding the prevention and treatment of delirium in the ICU, but multicomponent interventions reduce the incidence of delirium in non-ICU studies. Strategies for the prevention and treatment of ICU delirium are the subjects of multiple ongoing investigations.

### Pharmacologic treatment of delirium symptoms: a systematic review [^6b156009]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We conducted an updated, comprehensive, and contemporary systematic review to examine the efficacy of existing pharmacologic agents employed for management of delirium symptoms among hospitalized adults.

Methods

Searches of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to May 2021 were performed to identify studies investigating efficacy of pharmacologic agents for management of delirium.

Results

Of 11,424 articles obtained from searches, a total of 33 articles (N = 3030 participants) of randomized or non-randomized trials, in which pharmacologic treatment was compared to active comparator, placebo, or no treatment, met all criteria and were included in this review. Medications used for management of delirium symptoms included antipsychotic medications (N = 27), alpha-2 agonists (N = 5), benzodiazepines (N = 2), antidepressants (n = 1), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (N = 2), melatonin (N = 2), opioids (N = 1), and antiemetics (N = 2). Despite somewhat mixed findings and a relative lack of high-quality trials, it appears that antipsychotic medications (e.g., haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine) and dexmedetomidine have the potential to improve delirium outcomes.

Conclusions

Pharmacologic agents can reduce delirium symptoms (e.g., agitation) in some hospitalized patients. Additional double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are critically needed to investigate the efficacy of pharmacologic agents for diverse hospitalized populations (e.g., post-surgical patients, patients at the end-of-life, or in intensive care units).

### Exercise therapy for the treatment of delirium in the intensive care unit [^7088a3b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Exercise therapy in critical illness is a safe, feasible, and cost-effective approach that may improve cognitive function and reduce delirium as part of multicomponent nonpharmacologic approaches. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of each individual component.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of exercise therapy for the treatment of delirium in critically ill adults in the intensive care unit, compared to no intervention, usual care or any pharmacological treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and major trial registers as well as citation searching up to 12 July 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs assessing the effects of exercise therapy in adults with a diagnosis of delirium after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), with or without mechanical ventilation, compared to no intervention, usual care or any other pharmacological treatment. We excluded cross-over RCTs and quasi-RCTs.

Outcomes

Outcomes of interest were duration of delirium, health-related quality of life, delirium severity, cognitive function, mortality in the ICU, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay and adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB 2) for assessing RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all outcomes reported in the included trials. We summarised the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Included Studies

We included four parallel RCTs with a total of 491 participants. Three studies were conducted in mixed ICUs and one in a medical ICU. The studies were published between 2016 and 2023 and were conducted in China, Germany, the UK, and Turkey.

Synthesis Of Results

Exercise therapy compared to no intervention or usual care In adults with a diagnosis of delirium after admission to the ICU, exercise therapy may reduce the duration of delirium (MD -1.07 days, 95% CI -1.75 to -0.39; 4 studies, 121 participants; low-certainty evidence). Additionally, exercise therapy may result in no adverse events in adults with a diagnosis of delirium after admission to the ICU, as no adverse events were reported in either group (2 studies, 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). Exercise therapy probably reduces the ICU length of stay in adults with a diagnosis of delirium after admission to the ICU (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.63 to -0.85; 3 studies, 107 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies assessed health-related quality of life or delirium severity for this comparison. The included studies had an overall high risk of bias, or we had some concerns about the risk of bias, for the different evaluated outcomes. Imprecision in the effect estimates was also a concern due to small sample sizes and limited numbers of events. Exercise therapy compared to pharmacological treatment None of the included studies evaluated a comparison between exercise therapy and pharmacological treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In adults with a diagnosis of delirium after admission to the ICU, exercise therapy may reduce the duration of delirium, probably reduces the ICU length of stay, and may result in no adverse events. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life or delirium severity, and no studies compared exercise therapy to any pharmacological treatment. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate. We need further studies assessing the effects of exercise therapy on treating delirium in the ICU. These new studies must address the limitations found in the studies included in this review, especially considering larger sample sizes. Future studies should also focus on health-related quality of life, delirium severity, and cognitive function. They must also compare exercise therapy with additional treatment available in the clinical setting, such as highly disseminated pharmacological treatments, and focus on different population ages, delirium subtypes and pre-existing dementia status.

4 PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DELIRIUM

4.1 Multicomponent, sequential approaches

Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial causation of delirium, it is not surprising that single drug or non‐pharmacologic intervention strategies have not demonstrated effectiveness for delirium prevention or treatment. In terms of what is known already, multicomponent, non‐pharmacologic strategies, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP, hospitalelderlifeprogram.org) or the ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle have demonstrated at least partial effectiveness, with > 50% reduction in delirium across multiple studies. 31, 32, 33 These strategies should be further evaluated to determine minimum elements, doses required, and optimal implementation strategies. Novel approaches worth evaluating include new non‐pharmacologic strategies, with recent examples including prehabilitation prior to elective surgery and use of decision‐support technology to facilitate management. In terms of pharmacologic approaches, further evaluation of intriguing drugs should be advanced, including dexmedetomedine, 34 caffeine, acetaminophen, melatonin and agonists, and other sleep enhancement approaches.

Future treatment targets will arise out of pathophysiological research, and it is likely that treatments will need to be multicomponent. An evidence‐based, multicomponent bundle that encompasses both non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions targeted to proven risk factors and pathophysiologic pathways should be considered. Consideration of sequential approaches, targeting multiple biologic targets on delirium pathways, might prove a more effective approach than treatments aimed at a single target.

4.2 Novel trial designs

The traditional randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not well suited to addressing multiple interventions in heterogeneous populations who may have different outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Recent innovations in clinical trial design help to overcome limitations of the traditional RCT. Bayesian or adaptive trials allow continual design modifications while the trial is ongoing, allowing customization to multiple subpopulations and interventions. 35 This approach allows for prespecified modifications to key aspects of the trial as information regarding patient characteristics and outcomes accumulate, and areas of uncertainty regarding the true efficacy of the interventions being studied are reduced. Aspects that can be modified include sample size, randomization ratio, number of treatment groups, treatment administered or treatment dose, and the patient subpopulation being considered (allowing selective recruitment of populations most likely to benefit). 35 Platform trials are a type of adaptive design that may be of particular utility in delirium research as they evaluate multiple treatments simultaneously, based on the assumption that populations of patients with disease are heterogeneous and may respond differently to the same intervention. 36

### Delirium in palliative medicine: a review [^c1afcda2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Delirium is a devastating complication of general medical and surgical populations but of particular importance in palliative medicine. It is a clinical syndrome that is often not recognized and, therefore, not treated appropriately. The presence of delirium is a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality, longer hospitalization, and more likely discharge to a nursing facility. This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of delirium in the palliative medicine population.

### A roadmap to advance delirium research: recommendations from the NIDUS scientific think tank [^d07d43a0]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Complementary to individualized precision medicine are more broad‐based approaches to delirium prevention and treatment. RCTs examining efficacy — including adaptive designs — are useful to evaluate the treatment effect of interventions applied to selected populations under controlled conditions. By contrast, pragmatic RCTs assess the clinical effectiveness of interventions applied broadly in routine clinical care, and are useful to establish evidence‐based guidelines and practice standards. 37, 38 The most appropriate way to evaluate these broad approaches to care, such as clinical algorithms or hospital‐wide delirium prevention and management pathways, is to assess their impact on a population under the same conditions as in actual practice. 38 Historically, researchers have done this by randomizing interventions at the level of a patient grouping (or cluster), rather than at the level of the individual patient. Most often, in delirium research, patients are clustered at the level of a hospital, ward, intensive care unit (ICU), or other clinical setting. Other randomized pragmatic designs are nested in cohort studies or registries, such that patient data and outcomes are collected from trial and administrative databases, rather than collected by research staff. 39 The advantages of this approach are that the cohort provides a pool from which patients can be recruited, multiple interventions can be tested simultaneously, and control arm outcomes are available. 39 Similarly, registry‐based randomized trials use clinical databases (ie, administrative datasets retained by hospitals, clinical trials networks, health‐care systems, etc) as a platform for case records, data collection, randomization, and follow‐up, resulting in improved efficiency and cost. The limitations of registry‐based randomized trials include concerns about the quality of the registry data due to lack of blinding, standardized patient management procedures, and standardized outcomes assessments. 40 To develop new treatments for delirium, researchers hope to target pathophysiologic mechanisms to treat specific etiologic phenotypes of delirium. Testing these customized interventions requires modifications to traditional clinical trial designs, which may be accomplished using adaptive or Bayesian designs. However, beyond individual patients, there remains limited evidence about what constitutes best practice at the institutional level. To guide broad‐based practice, large pragmatic trials are required to establish the clinical effectiveness of system‐wide measures focused on delirium prevention and treatment.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^2c437553]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Delirium is a disturbance of attention, awareness, and a change in baseline cognition. Delirium is common in the emergency department (ED), especially in older adults. Between 6% and 38% of older ED adults have incident delirium, defined as new development of delirium after arrival, or prevalent delirium defined as those who present to the ED with delirium. Importantly, ED delirium is associated with increases in the length of hospital stay and mortality, and decreases in independence and cognitive function. Due to the prevalence of delirium in the ED setting and the associated morbidity and mortality, there is a growing support for ED‐based strategies to improve identification, management and prevention of delirium. Among accredited level 1 and level 2 geriatric EDs, 90% of level 1 and 40% of level 2 geriatric EDs reported protocols for delirium screening; in addition, many have implemented strategies to decrease delirium incidence.

The authors previously synthesized seven Cochrane systematic reviews that summarized delirium prevention or treatment trials across a variety of healthcare settings (Table S1). Multifactorial interventions, including individualized care, an educational component, reorientation, and early mobilization, often effectively reduce the incidence of delirium in the inpatient setting. Since 2012, four Cochrane reviews summarized pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic delirium interventions in both the hospital setting and long‐term care. The generalizability of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to the ED setting may be limited due to resource constraints and heterogeneous patient populations. To date, no systematic review has been published assessing delirium prevention or intervention programs targeted at older adults in the ED.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to identify pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent or treat delirium to reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of delirium in older adults presenting to the ED.

### WITHDRAWN: multidisciplinary team interventions for delirium in patients with chronic cognitive impairment [^4e5a6dd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is common in hospitalized elderly people. Delirium may affect 60% of frail elderly people in hospital. Among the cognitively impaired, 45% have been found to develop delirium and these patients have longer lengths of hospital stay and a higher rate of complications which, with other factors, increase costs of care. The management of delirium has commonly been multifaceted, the primary emphasis has to be on the diagnosis and therapy of precipitating factors, but as these may not be immediately resolved, symptomatic and supportive care are also of major importance.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess the available evidence for the effectiveness, if any, of multidisciplinary team interventions in the coordinated care of elderly patients with delirium superimposed on an underlying chronic cognitive impairment in comparison with usual care.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 3 July 2003 using the terms delirium and confus*. The Register is regularly updated and contains records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Selection for possible inclusion in this review was made on the basis of the research methodology - controlled trials whose participants are reported as having chronic cognitive impairment, and who then developed incident delirium and were randomly assigned to either coordinated multidisciplinary care or usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine controlled trials were identified for possible inclusion in the review, only one of which met the inclusion criteria. At present the data from that study cannot be analysed. We have requested additional data from the authors and are awaiting their reply.

Main Results

No studies focused on patients with prior cognitive impairment, so management of delirium in this group could not be assessed. There is very little information on the management of delirium in the literature despite an increasing body of information about the incidence, risks and prognosis of the disorder in the elderly population.

Authors' Conclusions

The management of delirium needs to be studied in a more clearly defined way before evidence-based guidelines can be developed. Insufficient data are available for the development of evidence-based guidelines on diagnosis or management. There is scope for research in all areas - from basic pathophysiology and epidemiology to prevention and management. Though much recent research has focused on the problem of delirium, the evidence is still difficult to utilize in management programmes. Research needs to be undertaken targeting specific groups known to be at high risk of developing delirium, for example the cognitively impaired and the frail elderly. As has been highlighted by Inouye 1999, delirium has very important economic and health policy implications and is a clinical problem that can affect all aspects of care of an ill older person. Delirium, though a frequent problem in hospitalized elderly patients, is still managed empirically and there is no evidence in the literature to support change to current practice at this time.

### Quetiapine for the treatment of delirium [^a06cccd9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized medically ill patients. Haloperidol has historically been the agent of choice for the treatment of delirium, but recent studies have explored the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics such as quetiapine. The unique pharmacology of quetiapine may allow it to treat delirium and provide sedation without causing significant extrapyramidal side effects.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of delirium.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase (January 1960-December 2012) using keywords "quetiapine", "second-generation antipsychotic", "atypical antipsychotic", "delirium", and "agitation".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search was limited to English-language articles and trials with treatment of delirium as the primary end point. Eight trials met this inclusion criterion.

Data Synthesis

Two randomized controlled trials, 5 open-label studies, and 1 retrospective cohort study evaluating quetiapine for the treatment of delirium were reviewed. One randomized controlled trial showed no differences in total mean delirium scores, but found the rate of delirium improvement was significantly shorter with quetiapine. The second randomized controlled trial showed the time to first resolution of delirium was shorter with quetiapine compared to placebo. Results of the open-label and retrospective cohort trials have also shown significant resolution of delirium from baseline and equal efficacy with quetiapine compared to amisulpride and haloperidol.

Conclusions

Quetiapine appears to be an effective and safe agent for the treatment of delirium in both general medicine and intensive care unit patients. The trials summarized suggest that quetiapine resolves symptoms of delirium more quickly than placebo and has equal efficacy compared to haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride. Further study is needed.

### Design and methods of the hospital elder life program (HELP), a multicomponent targeted intervention to prevent delirium in hospitalized older patients: efficacy and cost-effectiveness in Dutch health care [^fae90a38]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the next 30 years, the proportion of people 65 years and older is expected to increase to account for 25% of the general Dutch population, compared to 15% in 2008. Older people are at a higher risk for hospitalization. Of every 10,000 people 65 years and older, 3,131 older people were admitted to the hospital in 1995 and 5,521 in 2010. In 2005, 25% of the admitted patients in hospitals were 70 years old or older, for totaling 400,000 people. The risk for delirium is significantly associated with age, and in 2005, the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) indicated that 40,000 to 160,000 hospitalized patients 70 years and older suffer from delirium annually in the Netherlands.

Delirium is characterized by an acute disruption of attention and cognition and is the main cause of confusion in the general hospital. The DMS-IV criteria for delirium are as follows: a disturbance of consciousness with a reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention; a change in cognition (memory, language, or orientation) or the development of a perceptual disturbance not related to dementia; a quick onset that fluctuates during the day; and an underlying physiological problem or medication as the cause.

Patients with delirium are at an increased risk for complications and mortality during a hospital stay. Delirium can further result in adverse events after hospitalization, including lasting functional limitations, persistent cognitive decline, loss of quality of life for the patient and family, re-hospitalization and nursing home admission. Unfortunately, nurses and physicians often do not recognize the presence of delirium. Once delirium is diagnosed, standard delirium treatment consists of diagnosis and treatment of the underlying medical condition. Furthermore, management of delirium consists of environmental interventions addressing orientation, day structure, safety and, if necessary, the prescription of (antipsychotic) drugs.

Preventing delirium is preferred over treating delirium, and attention should therefore focus on (multi-faceted) prevention interventions. Recently, a meta-analysis of five studies of 1,491 older patients concluded that the perioperative use of antipsychotics may reduce the overall risk of postoperative delirium among older people, but the results to date have been inconsistent and some reveal only decreased delirium duration or severity, with either no impact or adverse impact on clinical outcomes.

Relatively little high quality research on delirium prevention (not including postoperative treatment) has been published, and an approach targeting several risk factors for delirium appears to be the best strategy to prevent delirium. Currently, there is increasing evidence that delirium can be prevented through non-pharmacological interventions.

### The Australian delirium clinical care standard: not just another brick in the wall [^8b78e253]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Delivering delirium care is challenging. Systems may not be set up to facilitate good delirium practice and staff may have low baseline understanding of how to spot, stop and treat delirium. In this context, delirium guidelines are especially important. In this article, we review the 2021 Australian Delirium Clinical Care Standards. The care standards are different to guidelines insofar as they focus on main presentations and represent eight quality statements describing the best evidence-based care patients with delirium should be offered. The standards speak to three different audiences: consumer, clinician and healthcare organisations. As such, they provide some system-level solutions to practice-level problems. They incorporate latest evidence and reflect the sway away from prescribing to treat delirium, stating that antipsychotics should be avoided. Furthermore, they promote inclusivity of families and carers in delirium care processes as an important medium to engender good practice. Limitations include the fact that they extend to delirium in multiple settings where different approaches may be necessary. They also lack the granularity of being able to provide recommendations on a greater range of drugs that might be used and assume settings are ready to introduce best delirium practice. In sum, they represent an important step forward for delirium knowledge translation and are particularly relevant for patients in the geriatric setting. The guidelines though are constrained as to what they can advocate due to research gaps especially into treatment of delirium.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^baa7034d]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions

The reporting of SAEs and SARs was heterogeneous, and few trials reported SAEs in accordance with ICH-GCP definitions. Some trials reported zero SAEs/SARs in both groups, yet did report mortality. Accordingly, SAEs/SARs are likely to be underreported. The pooled effect estimates of both measures of SAEs/SARs were rather similar and no significant differences were found. While we had sufficient information to reject a 20% relative change when SAEs/SARs were analysed as highest proportion, we had insufficient data when analysed as cumulated number of SAEs/SARs. This conflicting result is due to differences in proportions that affect the TSA analysis and as the true effect is expected to be between the two estimates, we cannot firmly detect or reject a 20% relative change in the proportion of patients experiencing SAEs/SARs when comparing haloperidol with placebo.

Other systematic reviews

A comprehensive Cochrane review on pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in critically ill adults was published in 2019. Data from two RCTs with overall low risk of bias have emerged since then, warranting an update. The Cochrane review included RCTs randomising patients with high risk of delirium; these trials were excluded in this review as patients were required to have diagnosed delirium at randomisation to be eligible for inclusion. Of note, we excluded the HOPE-ICU trial and the feasibility MIND trial as these trials randomised mechanically ventilated patients irrespective of delirium status. The Cochrane review found high-certainty evidence for no significant difference between typical antipsychotics (haloperidol) versus placebo on delirium duration, which is in line with our findings on days alive without delirium or coma for haloperidol versus placebo. The outcomes are not identical, but do measure similar events. Four trials were included in the meta-analysis for mortality in the Cochrane review, but only one was an actual treatment trial.

Other systematic reviews have been conducted in recent years, but like the Cochrane review, they included trials that randomised patients at risk of delirium or assessed the effects of haloperidol on preventing delirium. These systematic reviews are therefore evaluating the effects of haloperidol in populations that differ from this review that only included treatment trials.

### Advancing delirium treatment trials in older adults: recommendations for future trials from the network for investigation of delirium: unifying scientists (NIDUS) [^0f3ebe6d]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the delirium treatment trial literature, identify the unique challenges in delirium treatment trials, and formulate recommendations to address each in older adults.

Design

A 39-member interprofessional and international expert working group of clinicians (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) and nonclinicians (biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and trial methodologists) was convened. Four expert panels were assembled to explore key subtopics (pharmacological/nonpharmacologic treatment, methodological challenges, and novel research designs).

Methods

To provide background and context, a review of delirium treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2003 and 2023 was conducted and evidence gaps were identified. The four panels addressed the identified subtopics. For each subtopic, research challenges were identified and recommendations to address each were proposed through virtual discussion before a live, full-day, and in-person conference. General agreement was reached for each proposed recommendation across the entire working group via moderated conference discussion. Recommendations were synthesized across panels and iteratively discussed through rounds of virtual meetings and draft reviews.

Results

We identified key evidence gaps through a systematic literature review, yielding 43 RCTs of delirium treatments. From this review, eight unique challenges for delirium treatment trials were identified, and recommendations to address each were made based on panel input. The recommendations start with design of interventions that consider the multifactorial nature of delirium, include both pharmacological and nonpharmacologic approaches, and target pathophysiologic pathways where possible. Selecting appropriate at-risk patients with moderate vulnerability to delirium may maximize effectiveness. Targeting patients with at least moderate delirium severity and duration will include those most likely to experience adverse outcomes. Delirium severity should be the primary outcome of choice; measurement of short- and long-term clinical outcomes will maximize clinical relevance. Finally, plans for handling informative censoring and missing data are key.

Conclusions

By addressing key delirium treatment challenges and research gaps, our recommendations may serve as a roadmap for advancing delirium treatment research in older adults.

### Update of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care medicine evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on postoperative delirium in adult patients [^9b1d14f2]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative delirium (POD) is widely accepted as a topic of important medical and public health relevance. It not only impacts on the health, the well being and the life perspective of those who experience this adverse postoperative complication, but it often has severe consequences for the families, the healthcare system and the society as a whole. In recent years, awareness of its pathophysiological pathways, its clinical manifestations and its prevention has increased. POD develops when anaesthesia-related and surgery-related precipitating factors interact with a patient's predisposing vulnerability to delirium. Because of this, assessing the preoperative physical, cognitive, mental and social status of a patient scheduled for surgery is essential to quantify a patient's overall risk for POD and to tailor the optimal preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative treatment.

The aim of this updated guideline on the prevention and management of POD was to summarise the evidence in adults published since the end of the last literature search in March 2015. The suggestions and recommendations on the prevention and treatment and – if required – aftercare of POD are based on those of the first version of the guideline and on the new evidence.

Because of the large amount of new literature, the working group split up into six subgroups.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for delirium in the pediatric population: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^212ac257]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a serious complication experienced by hospitalized children. Therefore, preventive management strategies are recommended for these patients. However, comprehensive analyses of delirium interventions in children remain insufficient. Specifically, this systematic review aimed to summarize non-pharmacological interventions for pediatric delirium, addressing the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of effective strategies. We also explored frequently measured outcome variables to contribute evidence for future research on delirium outcomes in children.

Methods

This systematic review searched articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica databases. The eligibility criteria were formed under the population, intervention, comparator, outcome, and study design framework. Studies were included if they involved (1) children aged under 18 years receiving hospital care, (2) non-pharmacological delirium interventions, (3) comparators involving no intervention or pharmacological delirium interventions, and (4) outcomes measuring the effectiveness of non-pharmacological delirium interventions. Only peer-reviewed articles published in English were included.

Results

Overall, 16 studies were analyzed; of them, 9 assessed non-pharmacological interventions for emergence delirium and 7 assessed interventions for pediatric delirium. The intervention types were grouped as follows: educational (n = 5), multicomponent (n = 6), and technology-assisted (n = 5). Along with pediatric and emergence delirium, the most frequently measured outcome variables were pain, patient anxiety, parental anxiety, pediatric intensive care unit length of stay, agitation, analgesic consumption, and postoperative maladaptive behavior.

Conclusions

Non-pharmacological interventions for children are effective treatments without associated complications. However, determining the most effective non-pharmacological delirium intervention for hospitalized children based on current data remains challenging.

### Interventions for preventing intensive care unit delirium in adults [^5dd0ba67]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long-term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society.

Objectives

To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in-hospital mortality, the number of delirium- and coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.

Data Collection and Analysis

We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta-analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively.

Main Results

The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non-pharmacologic intervention. Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants)The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate-quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate-quality evidence)); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (mean difference (MD) -0.60, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate-quality of evidence)); number of ventilator-free days (mean 23.8 (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high-quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high-quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate-quality evidence). Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants)The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (MD -2.8, 95% CI -10.1 to 4.6, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of ventilator-free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI -0.68 to 3.14, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.13, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD -8.76, 95% CI -19.06 to 1.54, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future.

### Evidence-based treatment of delirium in patients with cancer [^2be58eef]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Delirium is the most common neuropsychiatric complication seen in patients with cancer, and it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are other well-recognized adverse outcomes of delirium. Improved recognition of delirium and early treatment are important in diminishing such morbidity. There has been an increasing number of studies published in the literature over the last 10 years regarding delirium treatment as well as prevention. Antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, and alpha-2 agonists are the three groups of medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials in different patient populations. In patients with cancer, the evidence is most clearly supportive of short-term, low-dose use of antipsychotics for controlling the symptoms of delirium, with close monitoring for possible adverse effects, especially in older patients with multiple medical comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic interventions also appear to have a beneficial role in the treatment of patients with cancer who have or are at risk for delirium. This article presents evidence-based recommendations based on the results of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic studies of the treatment and prevention of delirium.

### A multifaceted approach to prevention of delirium on intensive care [^b434fe46]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

Delirium is a frequently occurring event in critical care units that incurs an independent risk for poor short and long term outcomes for patients. It is can be difficult to diagnose delirium and, when delirium is identified, it can be difficult to treat with many drug therapies largely ineffective.

In order to reduce rates of delirium in critical care, a multifaceted approach is required with a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological treatments.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^c4d98d09]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

The abstracted set of recommendations presented here provides essential guidance both on the prevention of postoperative delirium in older patients at risk of delirium and on the treatment of older surgical patients with delirium, and is based on the 2014 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Guideline. The full version of the guideline, American Geriatrics Society Clinical Practice Guideline for Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults is available at the website of the AGS. The overall aims of the study were twofold: first, to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults; and second, to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the treatment of postoperative delirium in older adults. Prevention recommendations focused on primary prevention (i.e., preventing delirium before it occurs) in patients who are at risk for postoperative delirium (e.g., those identified as moderate-to-high risk based on previous risk stratification models such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, Delirium: Diagnosis, Prevention and Management. Clinical Guideline 103; London (UK): 2010 July 29). For management of delirium, the goals of this guideline are to decrease delirium severity and duration, ensure patient safety and improve outcomes.

### A call to action for delirium research: meta-analysis and regression of delirium associated mortality [^bd6a3787]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an acute state of confusion characterised by inattention, cognitive dysfunction and a fluctuating course associated with a medical cause, clinically diagnosed with the aid of delirium diagnostic tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium is a significant clinical problem faced by clinicians, with a prevalence of around 22.9% across acute and rehabilitation hospital wards. Meanwhile, an astonishingly high incidence of up to 89% of delirium occurs in the intensive care setting. Overall, it is thought to affect up to half of older (aged ≥ 65 years) hospital inpatients. Despite being of such importance, delirium remains poorly understood, and there are limited effective management options. There is scarce research on the pharmaceutical interventions for delirium, while non-pharmacological delirium interventions have risen in popularity. Multi-component and some single-component non-pharmacological interventions have demonstrated efficacy in prevention, but not in the treatment of delirium in patients > 60 years old. Furthermore, the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients were not reduced by non-pharmacological interventions. This lack of effective treatment is drastically different from other diseases that have similar prevalence rates.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to evaluate the effect of delirium on the simplest and most significant marker of health - mortality.

In 1987, delirium was still defined as a transient disorder. We now understand that delirium is associated with several negative sequelae. A meta-analysis in 2010 established that delirium in older people was associated with increased mortality, institutionalisation and dementia. This underlines the importance of delirium recognition and treatment, as failure to diagnose delirium may have devastating consequences.

Recent studies examining the effect of delirium on mortality across various settings have had inconsistent findings. Newer meta-analyses on this topic have been conducted in 2013 and 2015, both focused on critically ill populations, while one in 2017 focused specifically on postoperative delirium. Therefore, our current clinical practice is informed by studies with small sample size and isolated surgical or critically ill populations. An updated and statistically robust review is required to make a public health level impact statement that will change the way delirium is understood. Additionally, with the advent of multicomponent interventions, delirium tools, and efforts to increase delirium awareness, reviewing the trend of delirium-associated mortality over time would be a valuable reflection of the medical community's efforts in combating delirium. Therefore, a rigorous quantitative review of the prognosis associated with delirium is crucial and timely.

### The modified hospital elder life program (HELP) in geriatric hospitalized patients in internal wards: a double-blind randomized control trial [^7cf1bf51]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing the Iranian elderly population from 6.4% in 2020 to 11% in 2036 is inevitable. Older people are at a higher risk of hospitalization. The prolonged hospitalization of elderly patients reduces their cognitive and functional abilities.

Delirium is a common geriatric syndrome that affects one-third of the hospitalized elderly patients. Delirium has adverse effects on the patients' recovery, functional abilities, length of hospital stay, admission in long-term centers, and rates of death. Standard treatments under medical conditions may be difficult due to the development of delirium; so, primary prevention could be the most efficient strategy to decrease delirium, since at least 30 to 40% of delirium cases are preventable and the prevention of delirium is preferred to its treatment.

Implementing the multicomponent interventions' with help of an interdisciplinary aged care team could be an effective strategy to prevent delirium; because the members of aged care teams recognize the multifactorial etiology of delirium.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^a0fb9d7c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

Identify and manage causes of delirium — postoperative delirium in older adults: The healthcare professional should perform a medical evaluation, make medication and/or environmental adjustments, and order appropriate diagnostic tests and clinical consultations after an older adult has been diagnosed with postoperative delirium to identify and manage underlying contributors to delirium (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Delays to initiation of treatment have been found to result in possible prolongation of delirium, which is associated with worse cognitive and functional recovery, and higher inpatient morbidity and mortality; in multicomponent intervention studies that included evaluation and treatment of underlying cause(s), interventions were reported to significantly decrease delirium duration, improve Mini-Mental State Examination scores postoperatively, decrease length of stay, and decrease persistent delirium at hospital discharge; trends toward decreased length of stay and decreased mortality were also reported, although findings were not consistent across all studies and three studies were rated as low quality with a high risk of bias. Potential harms include balancing risks of delay against risks and costs of diagnostic tests and procedures with the possibility of pain and infection, the additional potential risk of overuse of neuroimaging, and that both sedating medications and restraints may exacerbate delirium; the AGS recommends avoiding physical restraints to manage behavioral symptoms of hospitalized older adults with delirium.

### A core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent and / or treat delirium for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission: an international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^a5abb2a7]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We followed Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) guidelines for this COS development study and report on it in accordance with Core Outcome Set–STAndards for Reporting. To commence the item generation process required for a COS, we conducted a systematic review of outcomes reported in published trials (1980 to December 2016) and registered trial protocols (January 2014 to December 2016) via (1) search term development in collaboration with two senior information specialists and conduct of the search across ten publication databases and grey literature; (2) two authors independently screening citations and extracting data on study characteristics, outcomes, and measures (with a third author as arbiter if needed); and (3) assignment of outcomes according to COMET taxonomy. We included randomized, quasi-randomized, or non-randomized intervention studies of pharmacological (e.g. haloperidol) or non-pharmacological (e.g. reorientation, music) interventions for delirium prevention, treatment, or both, conducted in adults or children experiencing an acute hospital admission. We excluded studies conducted in ICUs and those reporting interventions to treat pediatric or adult agitation on emergence from general anesthesia. In addition, our item generation process included semi-structured qualitative interviews exploring outcomes important to delirium survivors and family members.

Item reduction and consensus methods comprised a two-round, web-based modified Delphi consensus process. To gain final consensus, this Delphi process was followed by an in-person consensus meeting, hosted by the European Delirium Association, using a modified nominal group technique.

Recruitment of participants for qualitative interviews, Delphi panel, and consensus meeting

We sought a purposive and international sample from three stakeholder groups: (1) clinical researchers, (2) clinicians, and (3) delirium survivors and family. We recruited delirium survivor and family participants using a multi-modal strategy, including a designated study Twitter account, snowballing (i.e. research participants passing on recruitment materials to other potential participants), and personal contacts. Our multi-modal strategy to recruit expert clinicians and delirium researchers included recruitment flyers sent through membership lists of the American Delirium Society and Australian Delirium Association and to attendees of the European Delirium Association 2019 meeting (in-person consensus meeting), announcements at the American Delirium Society 2019 meeting, personalized recruitment emails sent to corresponding authors of studies included in our systematic review, flyers posted in UK National Health Service organizations, snowballing, and personal contacts.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^110929d8]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and haloperidol were equally effective and safe for the management of delirium in a broad population of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer. The focus of future placebo‐controlled RCTs should change to individualized, multimodal intervention strategies for managing delirium.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^896c1996]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review of haloperidol versus placebo or any comparator for critically ill adult patients with delirium, we found that haloperidol may reduce mortality and likely results in little to no difference in the occurrence of SAEs/SARs compared with placebo. For the secondary outcomes, we found that haloperidol probably does not reduce or increase the number of days alive without delirium or coma and may result in little to no change in the occurrence of QTc prolongation. No placebo-controlled trials reported on delirium severity, cognitive function or health-related quality of life. Sparse data were available for haloperidol versus other comparators, and the effect of haloperidol on reported outcomes is either very uncertain or may result in little to no difference when compared with other comparators.

Mortality

We chose mortality as one of our primary outcomes as it serves as a useful indicator for assessing the overall benefits and harms of an intervention in a population with high mortality. Delirium has been associated with increased mortality; thus, interventions targeted at managing delirium may therefore potentially impact mortality.

The quantity and quality of data have increased significantly since the original review as two RCTs with overall low risk of bias have provided data for the effect of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality. The effect estimate is in favour of haloperidol, but the pre-specified threshold for significance was not passed and TSA found that the required information size was not reached to firmly detect or reject a 20% relative change in mortality, and even more data are needed to establish firm evidence of smaller effect sizes as estimated in the meta-analysis (11% RRR). An anticipated 20% relative change in mortality may seem large as most interventional trials in critically ill patients find either small, clinically unimportant or statistically insignificant differences. More RCTs are therefore needed to establish firm evidence of the effect of haloperidol on mortality.

When we examine the meta-analysis for mortality of trials comparing haloperidol versus placebo, it is noticeable that the largest RCT (AID-ICU) included in the review found benefit of haloperidol while the second largest RCT (MIND-USA) indicated harm. Both trials are at overall low risk of bias. The opposing effect of haloperidol on mortality in the two trials may indicate that the effect of haloperidol differs dependent on patient population. Marked differences between the AID-ICU and MIND-USA trial populations were that patients in the AID-ICU trial were older and had more hyperactive delirium and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation.

### Outcome of delirium in critically ill patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^2ed1ce83]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

A high proportion of adults admitted to hospital experience delirium, a pathological alteration in cognition associated with inattention, a fluctuating course, and an underlying systemic illness, metabolic imbalance, or association with a drug (or withdrawal). Delirium has been linked to adverse short term outcomes, including up to threefold increases hospital mortality and length of stay, which place considerable burdens on caregiversand healthcare services. Delirium can also have long term consequences, with studies indicating an association between delirium and a higher likelihood of death, functional disability, admission to residential care, cognitive impairment, and dementia after discharge. The risk of delirium is particularly high in selected subsets of hospital patients such as elderly people and those with pre-existing cognitive impairments, people with terminal illnesses, patients undergoing major surgery, and those who are admitted to an intensive care unit.

The identification, prevention, and treatment of delirium are increasingly regarded as major public health priorities. Delirium has been described as one of the most common types of organ dysfunction encountered in intensive care, though its prevalence is variable across studies. Delirium can be overlooked, misdiagnosed, and its significance underestimated by healthcare providers working in intensive care. Studies evaluating the relation between delirium and mortality have yielded inconsistent results, some reporting a significant associationand others not.

Knowledge of the true magnitude of delirium and its associated burdens in critically ill patients would allow clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to allocate much needed resources towards reducing morbidity and mortality associated with delirium. We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating delirium in intensive care. We produced quantitative estimates of the prevalence of delirium in this setting and explored the association between delirium and short term clinical outcomes, specifically mortality in the intensive care unit and hospital, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. We also analyzed data on long term outcomes, including cognitive impairment after admission to intensive care.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^6ea721e8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society postoperative delirium in older adults — epidemiology and guideline scope are outlined: Postoperative delirium is recognized as the most common postoperative complication in older adults and has been shown to be preventable in up to 40% of cases in some hospitalized older adult populations, yet it is reported to remain undiagnosed in more than half of clinical cases. The clinical presentation includes motoric subtypes ranging from hypoactive (e.g., withdrawn, decreased motor activity) to hyperactive (e.g., agitation, heightened arousal, aggression), with mixed delirium showing both. The guideline's overall aims were twofold: to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults and to present nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions that should be implemented perioperatively for the treatment of postoperative delirium in older adults. Prevention recommendations focused on primary prevention (i.e., preventing delirium before it occurs) in patients who are at risk for postoperative delirium, and for management the goals are to decrease delirium severity and duration, ensure patient safety and improve outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the intensive care unit [^0999db78]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Sustained Use of Sedatives and Analgesics in the Critically Ill Adult" published in Critical Care Medicine in 2002.

Methods

The American College of Critical Care Medicine assembled a 20-person, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional task force with expertise in guideline development, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium management, and associated outcomes in adult critically ill patients. The task force, divided into four subcommittees, collaborated over 6 yr in person, via teleconferences, and via electronic communication. Subcommittees were responsible for developing relevant clinical questions, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org) to review, evaluate, and summarize the literature, and to develop clinical statements (descriptive) and recommendations (actionable). With the help of a professional librarian and Refworks database software, they developed a Web-based electronic database of over 19,000 references extracted from eight clinical search engines, related to pain and analgesia, agitation and sedation, delirium, and related clinical outcomes in adult ICU patients. The group also used psychometric analyses to evaluate and compare pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium assessment tools. All task force members were allowed to review the literature supporting each statement and recommendation and provided feedback to the subcommittees. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique and the modified Delphi method, with anonymous voting by all task force members using E-Survey (http://www.esurvey.com). All voting was completed in December 2010. Relevant studies published after this date and prior to publication of these guidelines were referenced in the text. The quality of evidence for each statement and recommendation was ranked as high (A), moderate (B), or low/very low (C). The strength of recommendations was ranked as strong (1) or weak (2), and either in favor of (+) or against (-) an intervention. A strong recommendation (either for or against) indicated that the intervention's desirable effects either clearly outweighed its undesirable effects (risks, burdens, and costs) or it did not. For all strong recommendations, the phrase "We recommend… " is used throughout. A weak recommendation, either for or against an intervention, indicated that the trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects was less clear. For all weak recommendations, the phrase "We suggest… " is used throughout. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or when group consensus could not be achieved, no recommendation (0) was made. Consensus based on expert opinion was not used as a substitute for a lack of evidence. A consistent method for addressing potential conflict of interest was followed if task force members were coauthors of related research. The development of this guideline was independent of any industry funding.

Conclusion

These guidelines provide a roadmap for developing integrated, evidence-based, and patient-centered protocols for preventing and treating pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients.

### Update of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care medicine evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on postoperative delirium in adult patients [^b2c15aeb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the benefits and harms of haloperidol or other antipsychotics for delirium therapy, it is uncertain if there are clear benefits, and the risk of undesired side effects remains. Delirium is a complex disorder, and there is no single drug intervention that plausibly could treat all cases of delirium. Therefore, the concept of a drug treatment for delirium as a whole is flawed. However, in some circumstances, the use of antipsychotics might provide some benefit. There is no clear evidence for this, but expert consensus from published guidelines and standards supports limited use of antipsychotics only for severe distress particularly in the context of psychosis, and/or if hyperactivity and/or agitation is causing significant safety concerns when nonpharmacological interventions have been insufficiently effective or if the indication is urgent. We advise a short-term, symptom-oriented therapy. The application should be bolus-wise and with the lowest dose (suggestion on the initial dose in the elderly: 0.125 to 0.25 mg haloperidol): especially in elderly patients, who are considered being at particular risk of developing delirium after surgery and in which the sedative effect of antipsychotics predominates.

Antipsychotic drugs should be used with caution or not at all in patients with certain preexisting neurologic conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or Lewy bodies dementia.

PICO 17: Should benzodiazepines be used for the treatment of POD?

Benzodiazepines act at the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA-A) and mediate via anxiolytic, amnesic, sedative and anticonvulsant effects via various subunits. In some hospitals, benzodiazepines are still an integral part of sedation in ICUs and are used routinely to treat agitation and other symptoms. Dependence can occur even at therapeutic doses and carries the risk of developing withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines often have active metabolites with a greater half-life than the basic substance itself, which increases the risk of accumulation, especially in patients with organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Midazolam, in particular, is associated with a risk of accumulation because of its poor controllability. The certainty of the evidence for the use of benzodiazepines in treatment strategies for POD was very low to nonexistent. In the studies analysed here, there was only one RCT using benzodiazepines for the treatment of POD. Its efficacy was lower compared with alpha-2 agonists.

Therefore, a symptom-orientated medication is essential in a bolus-titrated dosage, as low as possible.

### A call to action for delirium research: meta-analysis and regression of delirium associated mortality [^42775ed0]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Association between delirium related mortality and clinical setting

There was considerable statistical heterogeneity between studies for the outcome of mortality, according to the I² analysis. Our meta-regression showed that only setting, but not year of publication, accounts for this heterogeneity. Therefore, the residual heterogeneity may be explained by other covariates such as age, baseline cognitive state and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, all of which were difficult to incorporate into this study because of variable reporting.

Subgroup analysis focusing on the effect of study setting on delirium-associated mortality found greater mortality in the acute setting compared to the post-acute setting. This is the first meta-analysis to compare delirium-associated mortality between different hospital settings. The odds ratio was greater in the acute setting, especially ICU, compared to the post-acute setting. A likely explanation for the difference in effect size is the greater severity of illness in ICU. An alternative explanation could be that ICU delirium may mediate the effect of increased mortality indirectly, through increasing length of stay which in turn, prolongs exposure of critically ill patients to nosocomial complications. Our findings highlight that ICU delirium is a potentially fatal complication. However, only 40% of health professionals consistently screen for ICU delirium, suggesting that there is scope for improved detection and effective treatment of delirium in ICU and acute settings to improve outcomes. Furthermore, the variation in delirium mortality across different settings suggests that tailored management for patients with delirium may be required.

Delirium associated mortality over the years

With the advent of technology and the progressive developments in delirium research, delirium outcomes were compared temporally. We made a novel discovery that delirium associated mortality had not changed over the past 30 years. This was in contrast to the decline in cardiovascular mortality observed in the past four decades, as well as the steady drop of approximately 1.5% per year in cancer mortality over the past two decades. While pursuing an explanation for such a phenomenon, it was found that neither antipsychotic pharmacological therapy nor non-pharmacological interventions showed any benefit in terms of decreasing mortality. Greater awareness of delirium over the past three decades would have been expected to result in increasing diagnostic rates and lower mortality simply due to greater detection of milder cases. However, the fact that mortality has not changed suggests that we must consider novel research and treatment options. An intriguing finding that delirium incidence is reduced with alternate treatment settings in randomised and non-randomised controlled trials of Hospital in the Home and that treatment in those settings reduces mortality by 19% in the meta-analysis suggests another possible option for reducing delirium mortality.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^09bca99e]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a common, complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a high prevalence among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer 1, 2. This medical condition is characterized by changes in attention, awareness, and cognition, which develop over a short period of time and tend to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day 3. Delirium is associated with high morbidity and increased mortality 4, 5; it causes significant distress in patients and their caregivers and interferes with symptom assessment and decision making 6, 7. Therefore, early recognition and adequate management of delirium is of utmost importance in the care of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.

New guidelines recommend that the use of pharmacological interventions in the management of delirium should be limited to patients with distressing symptoms (such as agitation, anxiety, or perceptual disturbances) or if there are safety concerns in which the patient is a potential risk to themselves or others 8, 9. In general, haloperidol, a typical or first‐generation antipsychotic, is recommended as the first line pharmacological option 10, 11. A recently performed systematic review and meta‐analysis of 15 randomized clinical trials suggested that atypical or second‐generation antipsychotics, including olanzapine, have a benefit with regard to efficacy and safety compared with haloperidol 12. Pooled atypical antipsychotics were associated with a shorter time to response (TTR; standard mean difference [SMD], −0.27) and a lower incidence (risk ratio [RR], 0.3) of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). However, most of the included studies were single center with small sample sizes, heterogeneous study populations, and at risk of bias.

### Does melatonin prevent hospital-acquired delirium?… [^adadc8d6]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does melatonin prevent hospital-acquired delirium. Evidence-Based Answer Melatonin should not be used to prevent hospital-acquired delirium because it does not reduce the incidence, duration, or complications of delirium, including increased length of stay or mortality. Melatonin does not decrease the incidence of intensive care unit delirium or postoperative delirium. Melatonin is not currently recommended for the prevention of delirium in patients admitted to the hospital. However, ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, may lower the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients. 1 The trials randomized patients to melatonin, ramelteon, placebo, or usual care. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration of delirium, length of hospitalization, and mortality. Treatment with melatonergics decreased the risk of delirium. However, subgroup analysis by treatment drug showed that ramelteon, but not melatonin, lowered the risk of delirium. 1 Additional subanalyses by care setting found that melatonergics reduced delirium in patients admitted to the ICU but not in surgical or medical patients. Neither of the melatonergics decreased the duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, or mortality.

Results in the meta-analysis were limited by high heterogeneity in dose, duration, and formulation of medications; small sample size of included RCTs; and evidence of publication bias.

### A multi-phase quality improvement initiative for the treatment of active delirium in older persons [^b55e38fb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

The Hospital Elder Life Program emerged 20years ago as the reference model for delirium prevention in hospitalized older patients. However, implementation has been achieved at only 200 hospitals worldwide over the last 20years. Among the barriers to implementation for some institutions is an unwillingness of hospital administration to assume the costs associated with implementing programs that service all hospitalized older patients at risk for delirium. Facing such a situation, we implemented a unique and self-evolving model of care of older hospitalized patients who had already developed delirium.

Design

Hypothesis testing was carried out using a pretest-posttest design on program administrative data.

Setting

Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, a tertiary-care teaching facility. PARTICIPANTS A total of 9,214 consecutively admitted older patients to non-intensive care (ICU) inpatient units over a 5.5-year period, regardless of the suspected presence of delirium or risk status for developing delirium.

Intervention

A delirium intervention program targeting patients in whom delirium has already developed, with a modified delirium team supported by extensive workflow automation with custom tools in our electronic medical records system.

Measurements

Length of stay (LOS) for delirious and non-delirious patients on units where this program was piloted. Benzodiazepine, opiate, and antipsychotic use on the same units.

Results

There was a significant drop in LOS by 1.98days (95% confidence interval = .24–3.71), a decrease in the average morphine dose equivalents administered from .38mg to .21mg per patient hospital day, diazepam dose equivalents from .22mg to .15mg per patient hospital day, and quetiapine administered from .17mg to .14mg per patient hospital day for delirious patients on the program pilot units.

Conclusion

Elements of our unique active delirium treatment program may provide some direction to other program developers working on improving the care of older hospitalized delirious patients. However, the supporting evidence presented is limited, and a more rigorous prospective study is needed.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^773fdd66]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for delirium — Recommendation 3 states the panel was unable to issue a recommendation for or against antipsychotics over usual care for adult ICU delirium treatment (conditional recommendation; for intervention or comparison; low certainty of evidence). Evidence from a total of eight RCTs enrolling 1869 adult ICU patients found antipsychotics may slightly increase delirium-free days (MD, 1.25 d; 95% CI, −0.35 to 2.86 d) and may reduce 28-day mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.01) and mortality at longest follow-up (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–1.01), with little to no effect on duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay; there may be a slight increase in arrhythmias (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.66–3.74) and little to no effect on QT interval prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms. Trials predominantly used haloperidol; one administered both atypical and typical antipsychotics, and one had three arms: haloperidol, ziprasidone, and placebo.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^4f96abe2]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Delirium assessment tools and research gaps — trials rely on screening instruments, a validated severity scale exists, and high adherence to monitoring correlates with outcomes. "Almost all the clinical trials investigating strategies to prevent and/or treat delirium are based on delirium assessment tools", and "a recent publication (304) describes a new validated tool (the ICU-7) to document delirium severity and suggests that severity is associated with worse outcome". Observational evidence found "an association between high delirium monitoring adherence (i.e., assessments on ≥ 50% of the ICU days) and improved patient outcomes (i.e., lower in-hospital mortality, shorter ICU LOS, and shorter time on mechanical ventilation)", but "the lack of high-quality trials investigating the effect of delirium assessment underscores the gaps in understanding the relationship among delirium assessment and patient-centered outcomes, treatment decisions, patient and family satisfaction, and staff satisfaction".

### Non-pharmacological interventions in the prevention of delirium [^e698967a]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Delirium is a serious and common disorder especially among older people on inpatients units. Numerous modifiable or manageable delirium risk factors have been identified. As a result, there is now a widespread notion that many cases of delirium can be prevented. In this review, published data evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for delirium prevention were assessed in relation to their efficacy. Currently, most published studies are based on direct targeting of risk factors and/or introduction of educational programmes to increase staff knowledge and awareness. However, there continues to be a dearth of randomised controlled trials evaluating non-pharmacological interventions, partly because of the inherent difficulties associated with delirium research in general and with the evaluation of non-pharmacological interventions in particular. Instead, many of the available studies have been observational or non-randomised in nature. Nevertheless, the majority of these support a role for non-pharmacological interventions in delirium prevention. While more research is certainly needed, the majority of available data are based on best practice protocols, guidelines and interventions. Hence, a consistent and concerted effort is now justified to introduce non-pharmacological prevention strategies across units to help tackle the increasingly prevalent delirium among older people.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for delirium [^fca83f1c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is now the preferred term to describe acute confusional states. It is experienced by 10 to 30% of all hospital inpatients. Delirium is potentially reversible and is related to several adverse outcomes, including increased hospital length of stay, poor functional status, persistent cognitive impairment, need for institutional care and probably mortality. Disruption of the cholinergic system has been proposed as a key mechanism of delirium. Cholinesterase inhibitors enhance the cholinergic system and there have been reports that they might be beneficial in treating delirium.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of delirium.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Register of Clinical Trials (which includes records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, LILACS and other databases) was searched for relevant randomised controlled trials using the terms: donepezil or aricept, galantamine or reminyl, rivastigmine OR exelon and tacrine OR cognex on 19 April 2005. As this Specialised Register only contains trials relating to dementia and cognitive impairment, in addition all years of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for trials of cholinesterase inhibitors for delirium in non-demented people.

Selection Criteria

Unconfounded, blinded randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished in which treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors was administered and compared with alternative interventions in patients with delirium are included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (RO, SK) independently assessed the quality of the studies according to parameters such as randomisation, blinding and how dropouts were managed. Each cholinesterase inhibitor was to be examined separately and together as a group. The primary outcome measures of interest are length of delirium, severity of delirium and presence and severity of behavioural symptoms (e.g. agitation and hallucinations). Other outcomes of interest include: cognition, need for institutionalisation, length of hospital admission and adverse effects.

Main Results

There was one included trial of donepezil compared with placebo in 15 patients. No significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups was found in the duration of delirium. The mean duration of postoperative delirium for the donepezil group was 1.0 day (Standard Error 0.0) while for the placebo group it was 1.3 days (Standard Error 0.19). No other outcomes were measured for the patients who developed delirium.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from controlled trials that donepezil is effective in the treatment of delirium. Further trials using cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of delirium are needed.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^61e68958]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, a Cochrane systematic review included nine trials with 727 participants, assessing antipsychotics for delirium treatment in non‐ICU patients 9. Seven trials included a comparison of a typical to an atypical antipsychotic drug or placebo, including three studies evaluating patients with advanced cancer 13, 14, 15. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in delirium severity (SMD −0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.4 to 0.02; seven studies; 542 participants), overall delirium resolution (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.5; five studies; 349 participants), overall mortality (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.8–3.5; four studies; 342 participants), or increased risk of EPS (RR, 12.2; 95% CI, 0.55–270; two studies; 198 participants) with atypical antipsychotics compared with typical antipsychotics. There was no evidence to support or refute the suggestion that antipsychotics shorten the course of delirium in hospitalized patients. However, the results were assessed as (very) low evidence (downgraded because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and/or imprecision). Moreover, important clinical endpoints, like duration of delirium, health‐related quality of life, and cardiac arrhythmia, were not reported for any trial comparing typical versus atypical antipsychotics.

Taken together, the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in patients with cancer is controversial. Effective and safe strategies for the management of delirium remain an unmet clinical need. Atypical antipsychotics may be an effective and safe alternative to haloperidol. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy and tolerability of age‐adjusted and titratable doses of olanzapine versus haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.

### When there's smoke, look for the fire: the complex interplay between delirium and dementia [^5d2dd86d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We must pause to reflect on the potential limitations of this study. Despite applying multiple layers of matching to create a strong analytic cohort, all retrospective cohort studies conducted with health and administrative data have unmeasured confounders that potentially lead to over- or underestimation of the true effect. We note that the results may have limited generalizability because of the homogeneous race and ethnicity of the population from a single urban academic hospital. Although the long study horizon helped expand the sample size, the authors correctly noted that there are different definitions and treatments, most notably the identification of delirium over the 30-year period. All that said, these findings are exciting overall and add to the compelling need to consider the impact of new delirium in the hospital after discharge.

Delirium is a serious public health problem, as one in five patients experience delirium in the hospital. Prevalence may be as high as one in two patients in severely ill patients or those in critical-care settings. So, where are we in 2025 with extinguishing delirium in our hospitalized patients? Currently, there are no treatments that have been consistently proven to prevent or treat delirium. Just as we spend time considering prophylaxis for other hospital-acquired problems such as thromboembolic events and gastrointestinal ulceration, it is time to invest in finding universal and effective preventive measures for delirium as a serious hospital-acquired complication. In addition, focused research on the interplay and biological mechanisms of delirium and dementia is needed to identify receptors and proteins for targeted therapies. These will reduce the serious downstream consequences and their heavy impact on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Future delirium prevention and treatment studies must include long-term follow-up cognitive assessments to understand and compare the benefits of interventions.

### Geriatric emergency department guidelines [^7e99fa84]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Delirium and dementia in the geriatric emergency department — prevalence, screening, and management note that delirium and agitation are among the most common problems in older adults, occurring in approximately 25% of hospitalized geriatric patients, with consequences including increased mortality, morbidity, extended hospital length-of-stay, increased need for restraints and/or added staffing (sitters), and increased potential for lasting functional decline and subsequent need for nursing home placement; dementia and mild cognitive impairment are common in geriatric ED patients and often undetected, and routine cognitive screening and documentation provides a formal assessment at the index ED evaluation and a baseline for future ED visits; several dementia screening instruments have been validated in ED settings, and when done well, assessment can lead to directed interventions that positively affect the duration of hospitalization; the cause of delirium is often multifactorial — including acute medical illness overlying baseline cognitive dysfunction, medication effects and interactions, and decompensating co‑morbidities — and appropriate evaluation and management of each factor is critical to a positive outcome; medications and restraints (chemical and physical) can improve health and safety when used well but can increase the severity or length of delirium if used inappropriately, and treatment considerations differ from younger patients.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^35b47c54]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Treatment of delirium often includes haloperidol. Second‐generation antipsychotics like olanzapine have emerged as an alternative with possibly fewer side effects. The aim of this multicenter, phase III, randomized clinical trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine with haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.

Materials and Methods

Eligible adult patients (≥ 18 years) with advanced cancer and delirium (Delirium Rating Scale‐Revised‐98 [DRS‐R‐98] total score ≥ 17.75) were randomized 1:1 to receive either haloperidol or olanzapine (age‐adjusted, titratable doses). Primary endpoint was delirium response rate (DRR), defined as number of patients with DRS‐R‐98 severity score < 15.25 and ≥ 4.5 points reduction. Secondary endpoints included time to response (TTR), tolerability, and delirium‐related distress.

Results

Between January 2011 and June 2016, 98 patients were included in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. DRR was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31–59) for olanzapine and 57% (95% CI, 43–71) for haloperidol (Δ DRR −12%; odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.2–1.4; p = .23). Mean TTR was 4.5 days (95% CI, 3.2–5.9 days) for olanzapine and 2.8 days (95% CI, 1.9–3.7 days; p = .18) for haloperidol. Grade ≥ 3 treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 5 patients (10.2%) and 10 patients (20.4%) in the olanzapine and haloperidol arm, respectively. Distress rates were similar in both groups. The study was terminated early because of futility.

Conclusion

Delirium treatment with olanzapine in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer did not result in improvement of DRR or TTR compared with haloperidol. Clinical trial identification number. NCT01539733. Dutch Trial Register. NTR2559.

Implications for Practice

Guidelines recommend that pharmacological interventions for delirium treatment in adults with cancer should be limited to patients who have distressing delirium symptoms. It was suggested that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, outperform haloperidol in efficacy and safety. However, collective data comparing the efficacy and safety of typical versus atypical antipsychotics in patients with cancer are limited. If targeted and judicious use of antipsychotics is considered for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer, this study demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in response to haloperidol or olanzapine. Olanzapine showed an overall better safety profile compared with haloperidol, although this difference was not statistically significant.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^273c9d15]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

AGS postoperative delirium guideline — strong recommendations: This clinical practice guideline provides eight strong recommendation statements. Multicomponent nonpharmacologic interventions delivered by an interdisciplinary team should be administered to at-risk older adults to prevent delirium, and ongoing educational programs regarding delirium should be provided for healthcare professionals. A medical evaluation should be performed to identify and manage underlying contributors to delirium, pain management (preferably with nonopioid medications) should be optimized to prevent postoperative delirium, and medications with high risk for precipitating delirium should be avoided. Cholinesterase inhibitors should not be newly prescribed to prevent or treat postoperative delirium; benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line treatment of agitation associated with delirium; and antipsychotics should be avoided for treatment of hypoactive delirium.

### Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care [^837c00cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long-term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care settings.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) 's Specialised Register of dementia trials (dementia.cochrane.org/our-trials-register), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost-related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster-RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single-component, non-pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non-pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration-based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant-months; low-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness).

Authors' Conclusions

Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software-based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist-led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence-based care for this vulnerable group.

### A systematic meta-review of interventions to prevent and manage delirium in the intensive care unit: part 2-non-pharmacological and multicomponent interventions [^250fed28]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute, fluctuating, and reversible syndrome resulting in impaired cognition and/or consciousness. People with delirium have trouble maintaining attention and may have visual and auditory hallucinations. While prevalence estimates vary, up to 7 in 10 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) develop delirium, with estimates higher among mechanically ventilated patients. Patient risk factors for delirium include the severity of the acute illness, older age, and other comorbidities (cardiovascular risk factors, plus pre-existing impaired cognition, withdrawal from alcohol and nicotine). Risk factors relating to the management of critical illness include drugs (and dose) specific to the ICU e.g. sedatives and analgesia. The incidence of ICU delirium is expected to increase further with increasing admissions from an ageing population living with multiple long-term conditions.

ICU delirium is associated with a higher risk of mortality, morbidity, and prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, extending ICU and hospital lengths of stay and increasing healthcare costs. There are also costs associated with longer-term sequelae, which may include dementia, other cognitive or functional decline, and increased need for long-term care. Multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used to prevent and manage delirium in the ICU setting. Randomised controlled trials of interventions have been combined in multiple systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and network meta-analyses. However, there is a lack of overarching evidence syntheses and assessment of comprehensiveness to support future research and practice. We aimed to scope and map the meta-analysed evidence for interventions used for prevention and management of ICU delirium. This review is Part 2 of a pair of manuscripts detailing this work. (Part 1 details pharmacological interventions). The search strategy was common to both, but due to the different methods used for appraisal and analysis, and the vast quantity of data analysed, these 2 reviews are presented separately.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^8f9b18db]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the overall certainty of evidence

We evaluated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The overall certainty of evidence was rated as either high, moderate, low or very low based on our evaluation of the identified risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.

Our conclusions followed the GRADE guideline 26, which provides recommendations on how to communicate results of systematic reviews with informative statements rather than merely describe results as statistically or not statistically significant and avoid the common misinterpretation that large P values mean 'no difference' or 'no effect'. Instead, review authors are encouraged to focus on the point estimate and the certainty of that estimate which considers multiple factors (GRADE assessment).

Protocol deviations

We used RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias of each reported outcome. In accordance with the original review, we used a power of 90% in the TSA and not 80% as pre-defined in the review protocol, as meta-analysis should use higher (or same) power as its included trials, to be able to communicate the best available evidence. In addition, we used a diversity of 20% if the measured diversity was zero.

### Long-term clinical outcomes of delirium after hospital discharge: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^508ba976]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute, fluctuating neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by disturbances in attention, awareness and other cognitive functions. While common, delirium is under-recognised, with debate around its pathophysiology and a lack of effective treatments.

Delirium arises from complex and multifactorial causes, frequently linked to the pathophysiological impacts of acute medical conditions, medication effects or dementia. while delirium can affect individuals at any age, older adults are at increased risk likely due to age-related structural and functional changes in the brain that diminish reserve. Prevalence rates of delirium vary widely across patient groups and settings, ranging from less than 0.5% in the community to as high as 88% among palliative care patients. Delirium is particularly common in hospitalised older adults, affecting up to 60%.

Several studies across various settings have reported that patients who experience delirium, as compared to those who do not, face a higher risk of future cognitive impairment, dementia, functional impairment, readmission, institutionalisation, mortality, poor mental health and reduced quality of life (QoL). Meta-analyses have tried to tackle these long-term outcomes of delirium, but have only assessed one or a few clinical outcomes, a specific clinical population or have not examined the outcomes across different time-periods.

It is common to hear those in clinical practice comment that 'delirium is associated with all poor outcomes in older people', yet no paper has comprehensively tried to report on this. In this review, we aimed to synthesise evidence of all clinical outcomes across time, comparing those who experienced delirium with those who did not experience delirium in hospital, after their discharge.

### Pharmacological treatments of non-substance-withdrawal delirium: a systematic review of prospective trials [^c99f48ac]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Most reviews of pharmacological strategies for delirium treatment evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for delirium prevention, reduction in duration and severity of ongoing delirium, and other outcomes that extend beyond the recommendations of expert treatment guidelines. However, little if any attention is given to substantiating the potential benefits of such treatment or addressing the methodological weaknesses that, in part, limit the pharmacological recommendations made by expert treatment guidelines. Therefore, the authors conducted a systematic review to provide the most up-to-date and inclusive review of published prospective trials of potential pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium, and they discuss potential benefits of pharmacological prevention of delirium and/or reduction of ongoing delirium episode duration and severity.

Method

The analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including prospective randomized and nonrandomized double-blind, single-blind, and open-label clinical trials of any pharmacological agent for the prevention or treatment of delirium and reviewing them systematically for effectiveness on several predefined outcomes.

Results

The pharmacological strategies reviewed showed greater success in preventing delirium than in treating it. Significant delirium prevention effects are associated with haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics, iliac fascia block, gabapentin, melatonin, lower levels of intraoperative propofol sedation, and a single dose of ketamine during anesthetic induction and with dexmedetomidine compared with other sedation strategies for mechanically ventilated patients.

Conclusions

These promising results warrant further study with consideration of the methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies of studies to date.

### Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care [^b63ea791]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and distressing complication of a range of stressor events including infection, new medications and environment change that is often experienced by older people with frailty and dementia. Older people living in institutional long-term care (LTC)are at high risk of delirium, which increases the risk of admission to hospital, development of or worsening of dementia, and mortality. Delirium is also associated with substantial healthcare costs. Although it is possible to prevent delirium in the hospital setting by providing multicomponent delirium prevention interventions it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTCare effective.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in long term care.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register- on 23 April 2013. The search was as sensitive as possible to identify all studies on ALOIS relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in major healthcare databases, trial registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and grey literature sources, to ensure that the search was as comprehensive as possible.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single- and multi componentn on-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data, with any disagreements settled by consensus. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium. Secondary outcomes included new diagnosis of dementia, activities of daily living, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs)as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time to event data. Main results We included two trials that recruited 3636 participants. Both were complex single-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions. Risk of bias for many items was unclear due to inadequate reporting. Notably, there was no evidence of blinding of trial participants or assessors in either trial. One small cluster-RCT (n = 98) of a hydration-based intervention reported no reduction in delirium incidence in the intervention group compared to control (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00, analysis not adjusted for clustering, very low quality evidence). Results were imprecise and there were serious limitations evident in trial design. One large cluster-RCT (n = 3538) of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist-led medication review reported a large reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51, moderat equality evidence) but no clear evidence of reduction in hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10, moderate quality evidence), in mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17, moderate quality evidence) or in falls risk (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15, moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Our review identified very limited evidence on interventions for preventing deliriumin older people in LTC. Introduction of a software based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk so that a pharmacist-led medication review and monitoring plan can be initiated may reduce incidence of delirium for older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the United States and may not be practical in other countries which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. Our review identified only one ongoing pilot trial of a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention and no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of computerised medication management systems and multicomponent non-pharmacological and pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence based care for this vulnerable group.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^37637592]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of delirium often includes haloperidol. Second-generation antipsychotics like olanzapine have emerged as an alternative with possibly fewer side effects. The aim of this multicenter, phase III, randomized clinical trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine with haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.

Materials and Methods

Eligible adult patients (≥ 18years) with advanced cancer and delirium (Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 [DRS-R-98] total score ≥ 17.75) were randomized 1:1 to receive either haloperidol or olanzapine (age-adjusted, titratable doses). Primary endpoint was delirium response rate (DRR), defined as number of patients with DRS-R-98 severity score < 15.25 and ≥ 4.5 points reduction. Secondary endpoints included time to response (TTR), tolerability, and delirium-related distress.

Results

Between January 2011 and June 2016, 98 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. DRR was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31–59) for olanzapine and 57% (95% CI, 43–71) for haloperidol (Δ DRR -12%; odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.2–1.4; p = .23). Mean TTR was 4.5days (95% CI, 3.2–5.9days) for olanzapine and 2.8days (95% CI, 1.9–3.7days; p = .18) for haloperidol. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 patients (10.2%) and 10 patients (20.4%) in the olanzapine and haloperidol arm, respectively. Distress rates were similar in both groups. The study was terminated early because of futility.

Conclusion

Delirium treatment with olanzapine in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer did not result in improvement of DRR or TTR compared with haloperidol. Clinical trial identification number. NCT01539733. Dutch Trial Register. NTR2559.

Implications For Practice

Guidelines recommend that pharmacological interventions for delirium treatment in adults with cancer should be limited to patients who have distressing delirium symptoms. It was suggested that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, outperform haloperidol in efficacy and safety. However, collective data comparing the efficacy and safety of typical versus atypical antipsychotics in patients with cancer are limited. If targeted and judicious use of antipsychotics is considered for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer, this study demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in response to haloperidol or olanzapine. Olanzapine showed an overall better safety profile compared with haloperidol, although this difference was not statistically significant.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^9c7c324b]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multicenter, phase III RCT demonstrated no statistically significant difference in efficacy between olanzapine and haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized adult patients with advanced cancer. Treatment with olanzapine did not result in a better DRR or shorter TTR compared with haloperidol. This trial met criteria for early stopping due to futility.

The management of delirium is complex because of the considerable heterogeneity in terms of etiology and clinical subtype 22, 23. A number of brain neural networks and pathways have been implicated, but underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood 24, 25. The complexity of delirium suggests that a variety of interventions is most likely needed, which combines both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies, as appropriate to the cancer trajectory and goals of care. The question remains whether antipsychotic drugs are clinically useful and safe for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. If so, are atypical antipsychotics preferred because of their possibly better adverse effect profile and efficacy advantages in some patients?

Collective data remain limited on the activity and safety of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. A recently performed Cochrane review on antipsychotics for treatment of delirium in hospitalized non‐ICU patients 9 included three studies comparing typical to atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer 13, 14, 15. Lin et al. (n = 30; 100% with a cancer diagnosis) performed a single‐center, open RCT, and compared the efficacy between haloperidol and olanzapine to treat delirium (DSM‐IV criteria) in palliative and hospice center patients with cancer 13. Comparison of the scores of Delirium Rating Scale‐Chinese and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity between two groups showed no statistical difference. The study by Maneeton et al. (n = 52; 38.5% with cancer diagnosis) was a single‐center, prospective, double‐blind RCT which compared quetiapine versus haloperidol for the treatment of delirium (DSM‐IV‐TR and confusion assessment method criteria) [14]. The primary outcome measure was the DRS‐R‐98. They concluded that low‐dose quetiapine and haloperidol were equally effective and safe.

### Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^83544115]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effects of prevention interventions on delirium occurrence in critically ill adults.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Prospero, and WHO international clinical trial registry were searched from inception to April 8, 2021. Randomized controlled trials of pharmacological, sedation, non-pharmacological, and multi-component interventions enrolling adult critically ill patients were included. We performed conventional pairwise meta-analyses, NMA within Bayesian random effects modeling, and determined surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and mean rank. Reviewer pairs independently extracted data, assessed bias using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evidence certainty with GRADE. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence; secondary outcomes were durations of delirium and mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and adverse effects.

Results

Eighty trials met eligibility criteria: 67.5% pharmacological, 31.3% non-pharmacological and 1.2% mixed pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. For delirium occurrence, 11 pharmacological interventions (38 trials, N = 11,993) connected to the evidence network. Compared to placebo, only dexmedetomidine (21/22 alpha 2 agonist trials were dexmedetomidine) probably reduces delirium occurrence (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) 0.21–0.85; moderate certainty). Compared to benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.08–0.51; low certainty), sedation interruption (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.06–0.69; very low certainty), opioid plus benzodiazepine (OR 0.27, 95% CrI 0.10–0.76; very low certainty), and protocolized sedation (OR 0.27, 95% CrI 0.09–0.80; very low certainty) may reduce delirium occurrence but the evidence is very uncertain. Dexmedetomidine probably reduces ICU length of stay compared to placebo (Ratio of Means (RoM) 0.78, CrI 0.64–0.95; moderate certainty) and compared to antipsychotics (RoM 0.76, CrI 0.61–0.98; low certainty). Sedative interruption, protocolized sedation and opioids may reduce hospital length of stay compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. No intervention influenced mechanical ventilation duration, mortality, or arrhythmia. Single and multi-component non-pharmacological interventions did not connect to any evidence networks to allow for ranking and comparisons as planned; pairwise comparisons did not detect differences compared to standard care.

Conclusion

Compared to placebo and benzodiazepines, we found dexmedetomidine likely reduced the occurrence of delirium in critically ill adults. Compared to benzodiazepines, sedation-minimization strategies may also reduce delirium occurrence, but the evidence is uncertain.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^8165b121]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this 1-year follow-up study of the AID-ICU trial we assessed the long-term effects of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality and HRQoL in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium. We found that haloperidol reduced mortality, but did not statistically significantly improve HRQoL, although the HRQoL results had a higher uncertainty.

Mortality

The effect of haloperidol treatment on short-term mortality (28 and 90 day mortality) has been explored in different randomised clinical trials with differing results. This may be explained by differences in the recruited trial populations (prevention vs. treatment trials) and settings. Differences between the two largest treatment randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has recently been discussed in this journal. The present report is the first on treatment effects of haloperidol on long-term mortality and our results are consistent with a recent systematic review assessing effects of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality and serious adverse events in critically ill patients with delirium. This review concluded that haloperidol may reduce mortality as a meta-analysis of data from five trials and 1553 patients found a relative risk reduction of 0.89 (96.7% CI 0.77–1.03). This is currently the best estimate for the effect of haloperidol on short-term mortality (i.e. to a maximum of 90 days), which still includes some uncertainty and is primarily driven by data from the AID-ICU trial. In the present study we report the long-term effect on mortality of haloperidol versus placebo, and report an effect size that is in line with the primary publication of the AID-ICU trial. We observed a separation between the survival curves early in the intervention period (day 5–10 post-randomisation) and this separation remained until day 365. The effect estimate for survival was almost constant from 90-day to 1-year follow-up. The early separation of the curves could indicate that haloperidol has an effect on delirium management and that this effect is translated into improved long-term survival.

Differing results concerning mortality has also been reported in observational studies, where several cohort studies have found an association between delirium in the ICU and increased long-term mortality (6 months up to 18 months), and others (up to 24 months) found no statistically significant associations The data we present here are the first from an RCT.

### Antipsychotics for delirium [^af8572e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium occurs in up to 30% of hospitalised patients and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality. Recently published reports have suggested that the standard drug for delirium, haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic that may cause adverse extrapyramidal symptoms among patients, may be replaced by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine, that are as effective as haloperidol in controlling delirium, but that have a lower incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and incidence of adverse effects of haloperidol with risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine in the treatment of delirium.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 7 August 2006 using the search terms:haloperidol or haldol or risperidone or risperdal* or quetiapine or seroquel* or olanzapine or zyprexa* or aminotriazole or sertindole or leponex* or zeldox* or ziprasidone.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies included unconfounded, randomised trials with concealed allocation of subjects. For inclusion trials had to have assessed patients pre- and post-treatment. Where cross-over studies are included, only data from the first part of the study were examined. Interrupted time series were excluded. Length of trial and number of measurements did not influence the selection of trials for study. Where indicated, individual patient data were requested for further examination.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data from included trials. Data were pooled where possible, and analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated. Only 'intention to treat' data were included. Analysis included haloperidol treated patients, compared with placebo.

Main Results

Three studies were found that satisfied selection criteria. These studies compared haloperidol with risperidone, olanzapine, and placebo in the management of delirium and in the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Decrease in delirium scores were not significantly different comparing the effect of low dose haloperidol (< 3.0 mg per day) with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone (Odds ratio 0.63 (95% CI 10.29–1.38; p = 0.25). Low dose haloperidol did not have a higher incidence of adverse effects than the atypical antipsychotics. High dose haloperidol (> 4.5 mg per day) in one study was associated with an increased incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects, compared with olanzapine. Low dose haloperidol decreased the severity and duration of delirium in post-operative patients, although not the incidence of delirium, compared to placebo controls in one study. There were no controlled trials comparing quetiapine with haloperidol.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that haloperidol in low dosage has different efficacy in comparison with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone in the management of delirium or has a greater frequency of adverse drug effects than these drugs. High dose haloperidol was associated with a greater incidence of side effects, mainly parkinsonism, than the atypical antipsychotics. Low dose haloperidol may be effective in decreasing the degree and duration of delirium in post-operative patients, compared with placebo. These conclusions must be tempered by the observation that they are based on small studies of limited scope, and therefore will require further corroborating evidence before they can be translated into specific recommendation for the treatment of delirium.
