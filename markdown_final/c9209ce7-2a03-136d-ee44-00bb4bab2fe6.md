## Question

\section*{Task 1–021121}

At the international symposium in Moscow on problems of higher technical and humanistic education, Soviet Nobel laureate Nikolai Semenov explained that with the growth rate achieved in the USSR, the annual production of electricity could be increased to 10,000 times its current level in 100 years.

a) What annual increase (in percent) underlies this perspective?

b) How great was the average annual increase (in percent) in electricity production in the USSR from 1955 to 1961? (In 1955, 170 billion kWh were produced, and in 1961, a total of 327 billion kWh were produced.)

Compare the results!

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calculating the implied annual growth rate from Semenov's 10,000-fold increase over 100 years, computing the actual average annual growth rate in Soviet electricity production from 1955 to 1961, and then comparing the two results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the compound annual growth rate formula and how to rearrange it to solve for the rate. Then, I should verify the arithmetic for the implied rate. Next, I will calculate the historical CAGR from 1955 to 1961. Finally, I will compare the figures and interpret what they mean in context.

> Let me first confirm the compound growth formula. The standard CAGR relationship is Final = Initial × (1 + r)^t, where r is the annual rate and t is the number of years. To solve for r, I should rearrange to r = (Final / Initial)^(1/t) − 1, and then express the result as a percentage by multiplying by 100 [^notfound].

> Now, for part (a), I need to find the annual increase implied by growing to 10,000 times the initial value in 100 years. Plugging in Final / Initial = 10,000 and t = 100, I get r = (10,000)^(1/100) − 1. Wait, let me verify the exponent: 1/100 is 0.01, so this is the 100th root of 10,000 minus 1. The 100th root of 10,000 is 10^(4/100) = 10^0.04 ≈ 1.0965, so r ≈ 0.0965, which is about 9.65% per year. I should double-check that this makes sense: 1.0965^100 is indeed very close to 10,000, confirming the calculation [^notfound].

> For part (b), I will now examine the actual average annual increase from 1955 to 1961. The initial production is 170 billion kWh and the final is 327 billion kWh over 6 years, so t = 6. Applying the CAGR formula, r = (327 / 170)^(1/6) − 1. Let me calculate: 327 divided by 170 is about 1.9235, and the sixth root of that is roughly 1.1156, so r ≈ 0.1156, or about 11.56% per year. Hold on, I should verify the exponent and the arithmetic: yes, 1.1156^6 is approximately 1.9235, which matches the ratio, so the calculation is correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should compare the results. Semenov's hypothetical projection implies an annual growth rate of about 9.65%, whereas the actual observed growth from 1955 to 1961 averaged about 11.56% per year. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the actual rate might be lower than the projection, but it's actually higher by roughly 1.9 percentage points, meaning the USSR was outpacing the rate needed to achieve a 10,000-fold increase in 100 years during that specific period. I should confirm the difference: 11.56% − 9.65% ≈ 1.91%, so the actual growth exceeded the implied rate by about 1.9% per year during those years [^notfound].

> Let me consider the implication. If the 1955–1961 growth rate had been sustained for a century, the final multiplier would be (1.1156)^100 ≈ 23,000, which is more than twice Semenov's 10,000-fold target. But wait, I should be cautious: sustaining such a high rate for a century is extremely unlikely due to diminishing returns, resource constraints, and technological saturation, so Semenov's projection may reflect optimism rather than a realistic long-term trajectory even though the short-term performance briefly surpassed it [^notfound].

> Final answers: a) The annual increase implied by Semenov's statement is approximately 9.65%. b) The average annual increase from 1955 to 1961 was approximately 11.56%. Comparison: The actual growth rate exceeded the implied rate by about 1.9 percentage points per year during that period, indicating faster-than-projected expansion in electricity production at that time [^notfound].

---

The implied annual growth rate for electricity production to increase 10,000-fold in 100 years is **9.65% per year**. The actual average annual growth rate in the USSR from 1955 to 1961 was **11.56% per year**, which is higher than the implied rate. Thus, the USSR's electricity production during 1955–1961 grew faster than the rate needed to achieve a 10,000-fold increase over 100 years.

## Calculation of the implied annual growth rate

To find the implied annual growth rate, we use the **compound interest formula**:

[
A = P \\times (1 + r)^t
]

Where:

- (A) is the final amount (10,000 times the initial production).
- (P) is the initial amount (1 times the initial production).
- (r) is the annual growth rate (unknown).
- (t) is the time period (100 years).

Substituting the known values:

[
10,000 = 1 \\times (1 + r)^{100}
]

Solving for (r):

[
(1 + r)^{100} = 10,000
]

[
1 + r = 10,000^{1/100}
]

[
1 + r \\approx 1.0965
]

[
r \\approx 0.0965 \\text{ or } 9.65%
]

Therefore, the implied annual growth rate is **approximately 9.65% per year**.

## Calculation of the actual average annual growth rate in the USSR (1955–1961)

Given:

- **Electricity production in 1955**: 170 billion kWh.
- **Electricity production in 1961**: 327 billion kWh.
- **Time period**: 6 years.

Using the **compound annual growth rate (CAGR) formula**:

[
\\text{CAGR} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Ending Value}}{\\text{Beginning Value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} - 1
]

Substituting the known values:

[
\\text{CAGR} = \\left(\\frac{327}{170} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{6}} - 1
]

[
\\text{CAGR} \\approx (1.9235)^{0.1667} - 1
]

[
\\text{CAGR} \\approx 1.1156–1
]

[
\\text{CAGR} \\approx 0.1156 \\text{ or } 11.56%
]

Therefore, the actual average annual growth rate in the USSR from 1955 to 1961 was **approximately 11.56% per year**.

---

## Comparison of results

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|-|-|
| Implied annual growth rate (Semenov's statement) | 9.65% per year |
| Actual average annual growth rate (1955–1961) | 11.56% per year |

---

The actual average annual growth rate (**11.56%**) is higher than the implied annual growth rate (**9.65%**). This means that during the period from 1955 to 1961, the USSR's electricity production grew faster than the rate required to achieve a 10,000-fold increase over 100 years.

Designing a future without REMS — task force position on replacing product‑specific programs with standard clinical guidance — states that greater local, disease‑ and biology‑associated treatment guidelines and oversight for common immune effector cell (IEC) toxicities are needed and that individual manufacturers not be solely responsible for education through a product‑specific risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program; standard‑of‑care expert or institutional guidelines for the entire class of CAR‑T products reduce conflicting recommendations and are supplemented by product‑ or disease‑specific caveats, with accrediting mechanisms (e.g. FACT) ensuring SOPs at IEC‑accredited centers. The document notes that existing REMS programs may be phased out and that such guidelines should supersede existing risk mitigation measures and the current multiple and slightly different REMS‑dictated recommendations, with safety guidelines established and maintained by the clinical cell therapy community providing sufficient assurance when paired with initial implementation reviews and ongoing standard audits.

ACC/AHA performance measures — definition, attributes, and value-based prioritization explains that "Performance measures are an integral part of the cycle of quality of care improvement", and that the Task Force "evaluates those recommendations with the strongest evidence to consider which should become a clinical performance measure". Performance measures are "useful as direct measures of the quality of care", must be "clearly and precisely defined" and "reliably, reproducibly, and practically assessed" in real-world practice, and "should be "actionable", prompting actions to improve care. Although cost had not traditionally been a key attribute, economics were implicitly considered, and "The writing committee believes that it is important to consider both the cost-effectiveness and total cost burden of potential performance measures before selection", with quantification aligned to IOM goals to "minimize the likelihood that unintended economic consequences for society and hospitals emerge from adopting a measure". The Task Force "stressed the need for unbiased and high-quality cost-effectiveness analyses" and "recognized the difficulty in defining an empirical cut-point for the cost-effectiveness ratio". Regarding selection, "Previously, any Class I guideline recommendation could be considered as a potential performance measure", but with value assessments, "Class I recommendations labeled a poor value would not be considered for performance measures" and those "of uncertain value or with no available value data would have lower priority than those of high value".

### Centering cognitive neuroscience on task demands and generalization [^723a76a8]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Cognitive neuroscience seeks generalizable theories explaining the relationship between behavioral, physiological and mental states. In pursuit of such theories, we propose a theoretical and empirical framework that centers on understanding task demands and the mutual constraints they impose on behavior and neural activity. Task demands emerge from the interaction between an agent's sensory impressions, goals and behavior, which jointly shape the activity and structure of the nervous system on multiple spatiotemporal scales. Understanding this interaction requires multitask studies that vary more than one experimental component (for example, stimuli and instructions) combined with dense behavioral and neural sampling and explicit testing for generalization across tasks and data modalities. By centering task demands rather than mental processes that tasks are assumed to engage, this framework paves the way for the discovery of new generalizable concepts unconstrained by existing taxonomies, and moves cognitive neuroscience toward an action-oriented, dynamic and integrated view of the brain.

Special considerations for incorporating value into guidelines — use is framed as informational rather than prescriptive, with emphasis on high-cost or high-volume interventions and inclusion of resource-use studies in evidence reviews given methodological limitations. The goal "should be to provide information rather than to be prescriptive". Efforts "should focus on interventions associated with high costs or volume", and "Published studies of resource use… should be part of a comprehensive evidence review", while recognizing that methods to assess economic study quality are "not as well developed as that used to judge efficacy in clinical trials".

Vision is widely used as a model system to gain insights into how sensory inputs are processed and interpreted by the brain. Historically, careful quantification and control of visual stimuli have served as the backbone of visual neuroscience. There has been less emphasis, however, on how an observer's task influences the processing of sensory inputs. Motivated by diverse observations of task-dependent activity in the visual system, we propose a framework for thinking about tasks, their role in sensory processing, and how we might formally incorporate tasks into our models of vision.

### The low-wage labor market: challenges and opportunities for… [^da296b5b]. aspe.hhs.gov (1999). Low credibility.

Less Education, More Unemployment In good times and recession alike, workers with less education fare worse than those with more education. Moreover, things appear to have gotten worse for less-skilled workers during the 1990s. Figure 1 shows the unemployment rates for women and men by educational attainment in 1988, 1992, and 1997. Five groups of workers are broken out as follows:

- those with education beyond college. Figure 1a. Unemployment rate for women by education, 1988, 1992, 1997. Figure 1b. Unemployment rate for men by education, 1988, 1992, 1997. Figure 1 illustrates three points. First, in recession and economic expansion alike, the unemployment rate is higher for workers with lower educational attainment. In 1997, women and men with less than high school faced an unemployment rate of 13 to 14 percent. In contrast, the unemployment rate was 5.

5 to 6 percent for high school graduates, 4 to 5 percent for men and women with some college, about
2. 2 percent for college graduates, and less than 2 percent for those with more than four years of college. Even in good times, then, the labor market prospects of workers who have not completed high school are relatively bleak. Second, for all groups except the most highly educated women, the unemployment rate rose sharply in the last recession. Third, although by 1997 the unemployment rate had returned to its pre-recession level for other groups of workers, the unemployment rate for women with less than high school actually. increased in the post-recession period. That is, the unemployment rate for women with less than a high school education remained high as the economic upswing of the 1990s progressed.

This is the main finding in figure 1 that needs to be explained, since it raises an important concern for efforts to move former welfare recipients into the labor force. Fewer Women with High School or Less. A third trend is acting to blunt the two factors just discussed and to improve the labor market for low-skilled women. Specifically, the population of women with high school only or less than high school has fallen sharply since 1988. This can be seen in figure 3, which shows the population of women and men in each of the five educational categories examined for 1988, 1992, and
1997. Whereas the number of women with some college and college degrees has risen rapidly since 1988, the number of women with less than high school has fallen by nearly 13 percent, and the number of women with only high school has fallen by 10 percent. Figure 3a.

Population of women by education, 1988, 1992, 1997. Figure 3b. Population of men by education, 1988, 1992, 1997. Clearly, though, the first two factors — declining demand for low-skilled labor and increasing labor force participation rates of low-skilled women — have dominated the labor market for low-skilled women. As a result, the unemployment rate of low-skilled women has been on the rise. less severe than for women with more than high school. This does not imply that the last recession was in any sense kind to workers with high school or less, but it does suggest that, in relative terms, the recession of the early 1990s was not as hard on workers with less education than earlier recessions had been.

### Potassium channel TASK-5 forms functional heterodimers with TASK-1 and TASK-3 to break its silence [^e2280e75]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

On top of that, the involvement of K 2P channels in autoimmune diseases and cancer should not be underestimated. As with other K + channels, K 2P and in particular TASK channels have over the last years emerged as potential targets in cancer disease –. For instance, TASK-1 and TASK-3 have been demonstrated to possess pro‐oncogenic and proliferative potential in cell lines, and they are discussed as potential targets in various tumor entities. Although TASK channels have been extensively studied in cancer, the role of TASK-5 in cancer remained elusive, as the channel was thought to be non-functional and/or not involved in heteromerization with other TASK channel family members. TASK-5 is dysregulated for instance in pancreatic and lung cancer, as well as in thyroid and hepatocellular carcinoma –. Thus, the knowledge that TASK-5 is engaged in heteromerization and can be characterized by its unique single-channel conductance and pharmacological properties is of major relevance to this field of research and also provides access to functionally study the role of TASK-5 in cancer.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that TASK-5 is engaged in the formation of heteromeric channel complexes with TASK-1 and TASK-3. This discovery has an impact on proper disease understanding for all clinical studies involving any of the TASK channels. Thereby our results will have major implications for future studies of TASK channel physiology and pharmacology. In particular, the altered Gq-coupled receptor-mediated channel inhibition may be of physiological relevance in tissues where TASK-1 and TASK-5 are co-expressed. Moreover, the unique pharmacology of TASK-1/TASK-5 heterodimers is highly relevant for research and the development of novel drugs targeting atrial fibrillation, obstructive or central sleep apnea, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Optimizing practice through research: a new perspective to solve an old problem [^781b8e9f]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Policy makers, researchers, clinicians, and the public are frustrated that research in the health sciences has not resulted in a greater improvement in patient outcomes. Our experience as clinicians and researchers suggests that this frustration could be reduced if health sciences research were directed by 5 broad principles: (1) the needs of patients and populations determine the research agenda; (2) the research agenda addresses contextual and implementation issues, including the development of delivery and accountability systems; (3) the research agenda determines the research methods rather than methods determines the research agenda; (4) researchers and clinicians collaborate to define the research agenda, allocate resources, and implement findings; and (5) the level of funding for implementation research is commensurate with and proportional to the magnitude of the task. To keep the research agenda focused on the task of improving health and to acknowledge that the effort must be seen as more comprehensive than translating or transferring research into practice (TRIP), we suggest that the task be reframed, using the term optimizing practice through research.

American Society of Anesthesiologists practice advisory — management of operating room fires instructs that when an early warning sign is noted, halt the procedure and call for an evaluation of fire, and when a fire is definitely present, immediately announce the fire, halt the procedure, and initiate fire management tasks. Team members should perform their preassigned fire management tasks as quickly as possible, including that before the procedure, the team may identify a predetermined order, if a team member cannot rapidly perform his or her task in the predetermined order, other team members should perform their tasks without waiting, and when a team member has completed a preassigned task, he or she should help other members to perform tasks that are not yet complete. For a fire in the airway or breathing circuit, as fast as possible, remove the tracheal tube, stop the flow of all airway gases, remove all flammable and burning materials from the airway, and pour saline or water into the patient's airway; for a fire elsewhere on or in the patient, as fast as possible, stop the flow of all airway gases and remove all drapes, flammable, and burning materials from the patient.

### Consensus definitions of perception-action-integration in action control [^f4792325]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Box 3 Task set and context from an event-coding perspective

Task set

A task set comprises the mental representations of those stimulus dimensions that are relevant for the current task, together with the response options and stimulus-response mappings. Moreover, it comprises the cognitive control processes that enable the translation of current perceptual information and task demands into appropriate motor output. In action control research, the task set therefore determines the rules and the boundaries of the goal-directed behaviors participants engage in. In multitasking research, investigating how agents deal with multiple tasks, experimental settings are thought to comprise multiple task sets. Task sets can have components that can be either "modular" (i.e. can be reconfigured independently) or "integrated" (can be changed only as a whole).

Context

The term "context" is broad and can refer to any aspect of the environment including, for instance, stimulus features and background noise, spatial locations where stimuli appear, or states of the person, e.g. affect. Such a broad definition clearly limits the possibility to truly define context boundaries. However, action control research has also adopted a narrower definition, whereby the context is a task-irrelevant event that may not be constant throughout a stream of events and can alternate as the task-relevant features do. Accordingly, contextual features are nominally irrelevant since they are not part of any task set, that is, they neither determine the rules nor the boundaries of a goal-directed behavior. Nonetheless, context features (of many kinds, see above) can be integrated into event-files and then serve as retrieval cue for this event-file. Alternatively, context representations may modulate binding processes by inducing event segmentation. Namely, a context switch sets a boundary that dissects previous series of events into a coherent representation matching the expectations of how a series of events usually unfolds. Switching the context segments the current trial from the previous trial, while a context repetition might not set such a boundary so that the different events are considered as belonging together. Hence, the context would not work as a retrieval factor, but would reduce activation of the previous-trial features in case of a switch versus leaving it unaffected in case of a repetition.

### General neurology: current challenges and future implications [^2a4a4820]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

In the coming decades, the world will face an increasing burden of neurological disorders (ND) and an urgent need to promote brain health. These challenges contrast with an insufficient neurological workforce in most countries, as well as decreasing numbers of general neurologists and neurologists attracted to work in general neurology (GN). This white paper aims to review the current situation of GN and reflect on its future.

Methods

The European Academy of Neurology (EAN) task force (TF) met nine times between November 2021 and June 2023. During the 2023 EAN annual meeting, attendees were asked to answer five questions concerning the future of GN. The document was sent for suggestions and eventually approval to the board and the presidents of the 47 national societies of the EAN.

Results

The TF first identified four relevant current and future challenges related to GN: (i) definition, (ii) practice, (iii) education, and (iv) research. The TF then identified seven initiatives to further develop GN at both the academic and community level. Finally, the TF formulated 16 recommendations to promote GN in the future.

Conclusions

GN will remain essential in the coming decades to provide rapid, accessible, and comprehensive management of patients with ND that is affordable and cost‐effective. There is also a need for research, education, and other initiatives aiming to facilitate improved working conditions, recognition, and prestige for those pursuing a career in GN.

### Development and assessment of a novel task trainer and targeting tasks for ultrasound-guided invasive procedures [^7fd35d8e]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) recommends that all providers performing ultrasound-guided invasive procedures be competent in a core set of guidance skills common to all ultrasound-guided procedures, including in-plane and out-of-plane needle guidance and needle imaging optimization techniques such as probe translation, rotation, and heel-toe standoff. To allow for the practice and assessment of these core skills, we have created a novel task trainer and set of targeting tasks, and sought to obtain validity evidence in the content and response process domains for this training and assessment system according to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing.

Materials and Methods

We have constructed an ultrasound-guided invasive procedure training system and five targeting tasks that focused on the needle guidance skills outlined by the AIUM. All tasks were performed by obstetrics and gynecology or maternal-fetal medicine physicians with and without experience in ultrasound-guided invasive procedures during a series of simulation workshops. All participants completed a survey regarding the trainer's and the tasks' usefulness in the training of inexperienced physicians.

Results

The physicians who completed the tasks had favorable views of task trainer and curriculum. The targeting curriculum was felt to allow practice of all of the core guidance skills outlined by the AIUM. The average response provided for all of the tasks was 4.0 or greater, with half of the items having an average response of 4.5 or higher.

Conclusions

We have constructed a task trainer that incorporates all of the core skills outlined by the AIUM. All five tasks received very favorable reviews from both experienced and inexperienced providers. Taken together, our findings suggest they have strong content and response process validity evidence.

Intraoperative awareness — postevent evaluation and pharmacologic considerations are outlined as follows: A statement asserts "Benzodiazepines or scopolamine should be administered intraoperatively to prevent awareness after a patient has unexpectedly become conscious". However, the Task Force believes that evidence from the literature is not sufficient to provide guidance regarding this issue and cautions that "the use of scopolamine may result in unintended side effects (e.g., emergence delirium)". Practitioners should speak with patients who report recall of intraoperative events to obtain details and discuss possible reasons; a questionnaire or structured interview may be used to obtain a detailed account; once an episode has been reported, an occurrence report should be completed for quality management; and the patient should be offered counseling or psychological support.

### Limited health risks in performing drug reconstitution and handling tasks in pharmacies-results of an occupational risk assessment study [^7b6b8e77]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Quantitative Analyses

For the quantitative analyses, particle counts from the first part of the study were combined with results from additional measurements of tasks 4, 7, 8, and 9, which were done in two additional separate pharmacies during December 2017 using the APS results. Task 9, repacking of tablets from a bulk supply into small packages by hand, was found to be performed by workers in two distinct ways: (a) pouring tablets over from a large into a small package or (b) counting them out using a tablet counter (see Appendix B for more details). Thus, task 9 was subdivided in 9a and 9b, and both methods were measured. Results, stratified to particle size, showed a large variability (Table 1), with the highest particle counts in the task "repacking of tablets from a bulk supply into small packages by hand when pouring the tablets from one package into another" (task 9a: maximum 589.65 μg/m 3 for PM10), followed by splitting tablets without a score line on a workbench with a splitter (task 5: this task was measured in only one pharmacy, hence no maximum between locations can be determined) and opening capsules and pouring out the contents on a work bench (task 8: maximum 43.14 μg/m 3 for PM10). When comparing task 9a and 9b, the use of a tablet counter reduced the number of particles almost 50-fold. The tasks that resulted in no particle exposures on average were the tasks involving handling of parenteral drugs: reconstitution from a vial. Here, the number of particles was not raised when compared with the far field measurements. The indicative first part of the trial did not show a clear risk for task 5, which might in hindsight be a result of a short pause between performing handling task 9 and then task 5 (Fig. 2), and the relatively high background particles still present from performing task 9. As not only the mean or standard deviation is relevant, very short peak exposures could be relevant as well; boxplots of the four worst-case task measurements including each of the three different particle counters were made (Fig. 3). Also here, it is clearly visible that task 9a gives the highest particle burden with a clear difference between the near field and the far field. Moreover, the two different particle counters that were used, APS and OPC, give very comparable results. Finally, the variability and maximum particle counts show the greatest range in task 7 and task 9b.

### Targeted time-varying functional connectivity [^99cfa42b]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Empirical Assessment

To assess the models' ability to capture task‐relevant information, we calculated classification accuracy in distinguishing task conditions over time using state time courses derived from each model. For each subject, the state time courses were epoched by trial onset and averaged across trials of the same condition, resulting in condition‐specific mean trial‐locked state time courses. At each timepoint 𝑡, these subject‐level averages, arranged in a matrix with subjects as rows and conditions as columns, were used as predictors for classification. We used logistic regression for the simulated data (two conditions); and ordinal logistic regression for the real data, given the ordered nature of the conditions (binary, ternary and quaternary). All runs of the models were unsupervised, with no prior knowledge of task timings. We applied 5‐fold subject‐wise cross‐validation, ensuring that subjects were not split between folds (i.e. a model tested on a given subject had not seen any trial of that subject during training). Within each fold, the predictive model was trained on data from four folds (training data) and used to predict task conditions for the remaining fold (test data). Classification accuracy was computed as the percentage of correctly classified task conditions across subjects in the test fold. This process was repeated for each fold, yielding an overall cross‐validated accuracy score. A perfect classification corresponds to an accuracy of 1, while 1/ N indicates random guessing among N conditions.

### The order of task decisions and confidence ratings has little effect on metacognition [^f2463b61]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we examined how the act of reporting affects metacognition in common experimental protocols. Our research was motivated by evidence that a crucial feature of behavioural experiments, the order of task decisions and confidence ratings, can bias metacognitive performance, possibly by influencing the timing of reports or the actions involved. In perception and memory tasks that tightly controlled participants' accuracy, we found that manipulating the order of reports had little effect on metacognitive efficiency. This pattern held in a standard experimental context, where reports were untimed and actions could be prepared in advance, as well as in controlled contexts that restricted timing and motor preparation. Together, our 7 registered hypotheses find little evidence that report order is a practical concern when collecting or analysing metacognitive reports.

The strong results for hypotheses 1 and 2 indicate that our timing manipulation successfully limited report time, and that order bias, if present, would be captured by our context manipulations. In all conditions, we calibrated task performance to the same threshold and examined metacognition in a distinct test phase with fixed stimulus properties. This design minimised the influence of performance and stimulus variability, producing a test environment that was relatively free of task-related confounds.

### Task representations in neural networks trained to perform many cognitive tasks [^390d3f9b]. Nature Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

The brain has the ability to flexibly perform many tasks, but the underlying mechanism cannot be elucidated in traditional experimental and modeling studies designed for one task at a time. Here, we trained single network models to perform 20 cognitive tasks that depend on working memory, decision making, categorization, and inhibitory control. We found that after training, recurrent units can develop into clusters that are functionally specialized for different cognitive processes, and we introduce a simple yet effective measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks. Learning often gives rise to compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, networks developed mixed task selectivity similar to recorded prefrontal neurons after learning multiple tasks sequentially with a continual-learning technique. This work provides a computational platform to investigate neural representations of many cognitive tasks.

### The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology: update on objectives and educational and research activities… [^d8f2155e]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

ESGO objectives have been recently identified through a strategic planning process and include education, care, research, collaboration, awareness, and sustainability. As a leading gynecologic oncology society, ESGO holds biennial meetings where experts meet to discuss latest advances in gynecologic treatment and care. The 17. thInternational Meeting of ESGO proved to be a resounding success, with 2, 700 delegates and speakers who gathered from around the world in the cultured city of Milan, Italy. The structure of the congress included keynote lectures, debates, state-of-the art sessions, and focused sunrise sessions, together with oral and poster presentations and satellite symposia sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.

Looking back over the last decade, our membership has increased rapidly from being an exclusive club of about 150 members in 2002 into a truly pan-European and international community of multidisciplinary professionals: ESGO had 1, 330 members in 2011, with an additional 240 new members joining in the last quarter of the year. 1Cervical cancer is the seventh most common cancer among European women of all ages, and the second most common cancer in women ages 15 to 39 years. 2Rates are highest among women in countries of the former Soviet Union, who have twice the risk of dying as a result of cervical cancer as Western European women. Women in Romania are 11 times more likely than Finnish women to die as a result of cervical cancer.
3. ESGO Objectives Considering the changing external and internal environment, as well as global and medical trends affecting the field of gynecologic oncology, ESGO conducted strategic planning during
2011.

The aims were to analyze the current positioning of the Society; define its future as Europe's leader in education, research, and care in the field of gynecologic cancers; and ensure ESGO's continuous development as an active resource of knowledge, information, collaboration and networking for its members and all professionals in the field. Having in mind the ESGO mission to improve the health and well-being of European women with genital and breast cancers, core fields of interest were defined and general objectives were established: 1) education — to provide high quality educational activities and improve training in gynaecologic oncology in Europe; 2) care — to establish multidisciplinary. Education and Outreach One of ESGO's primary missions is to provide high-quality educational activities and improve training in gynecologic oncology in Europe.

The highlight of the educational activities is organizing the ESGO international bi-annual meeting, which has a main focus on education, but with an ongoing trend to present science and research. The ESGO 17 proved to be a resounding success, with 2, 700 delegates and speakers who gathered from around the world in the cultured city of Milan, Italy. The structure of the congress included keynote lectures, debates, state-of-the art sessions, and focused sunrise sessions, together with oral and poster presentations and satellite symposia sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. The keynote lectures were presented by Prof. Umberto Veronesi and Prof. Rene Bernards. Prof. Veronesi focused on the progress in breast cancer management, highlighting his lifetime achievements on the quality of life QOL of women with breast cancer.

### Occupational therapy in pulmonary rehabilitation programs: a scoping review [^63081ecc]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a multidisciplinary intervention forming the cornerstone of chronic respiratory disease management, improving individuals' exercise capacities and abilities to complete activities of daily living (ADLs). Although the occupational therapy (OT) scope of practice focuses on similar outcomes as PR, the tasks/roles and benefit of including OT in PR has not been reviewed. This scoping review synthesized the i) tasks/roles, ii) recommendations of guidelines, iii) prevalence and iv) effects of OT as part of PR programs. Searching of four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane), OT association websites, and hand searching was performed, and 51 records were included. The OT tasks/roles most reported include teaching energy conservation techniques (n = 23), addressing ADLs (n = 17), and assisting with breathlessness management (n = 10). Using the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement these tasks/roles were grouped into person (n = 16 unique tasks/roles), occupation (n = 6 tasks/roles), environment (n = 5 tasks/roles), and other (n = 3 tasks/roles) domains and were endorsed by two available practice guidelines addressing OT in PR programs. From 13 PR surveys across four continents, 17–92% of PR programs included OT. Inclusion of OT in PR resulted in positive effects on ADLs, pulmonary function, dyspnea, quality of life, and mortality. Although an increasing number of PR programs include occupational therapists in their multidisciplinary teams, there is a paucity of original studies and guidelines reporting on the tasks/roles and benefits of OT in PR. Further research is needed to clearly define the tasks/roles of OT in multidisciplinary PR teams and contributions to enhancing patient outcomes.

### Dynamic task-belief is an integral part of decision-making [^e46710d1]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

Natural decisions involve two seemingly separable processes: inferring the relevant task (task-belief) and performing the believed-relevant task. The assumed separability has led to the traditional practice of studying task-switching and perceptual decision-making individually. Here, we used a novel paradigm to manipulate and measure macaque monkeys' task-belief and demonstrated inextricable neuronal links between flexible task-belief and perceptual decision-making. We showed that in animals, but not in artificial networks that performed as well or better than the animals, stronger task-belief is associated with better perception. Correspondingly, recordings from neuronal populations in cortical areas 7a and V1 revealed that stronger task-belief is associated with better discriminability of the believed-relevant, but not the believed-irrelevant, feature. Perception also impacts belief updating; noise fluctuations in V1 help explain how task-belief is updated. Our results demonstrate that complex tasks and multi-area recordings can reveal fundamentally new principles of how biology affects behavior in health and disease.

### Disentangling the respective contribution of task selection and task execution to self-directed cognitive control development [^cf85d01d]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Task selection and task execution are key constructs in cognitive control development. Yet, little is known about how separable they are and how each contributes to task switching performance. Here, 60 4- to 5-year olds, 60 7- to 8-year olds, and 60 10- to 11-year olds children completed the double registration procedure, which dissociates these two processes. Task selection yielded both mixing and switch costs, especially in younger children, and task execution mostly yielded switch costs at all ages, suggesting that task selection is costlier than task execution. Moreover, both task selection and execution varied with task self-directedness (i.e., to what extent the task is driven by external aids) demands. Whereas task selection and task execution are dissociated regarding performance costs, they nevertheless both contribute to self-directed control.

### The role of task understanding on younger and older adults' performance [^5556b136]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Age-related performance decrements have been linked to inferior strategic choices. Strategy selection models argue that accurate task representations are necessary for choosing appropriate strategies. But no studies to date have compared task representations in younger and older adults. Metacognition research suggests age-related deficits in updating and utilizing strategy knowledge, but other research suggests age-related sparing when information can be consolidated into a coherent mental model.

Method

Study 1 validated the use of concept mapping as a tool for measuring task representation accuracy. Study 2 measured task representations before and after a complex strategic task to test for age-related decrements in task representation formation and updating.

Results

Task representation accuracy and task performance were equivalent across age groups. Better task representations were related to better performance. However, task representation scores remained fairly stable over the task with minimal evidence of updating.

Discussion

Our findings mirror those in the mental model literature suggesting age-related sparing of strategy use when information can be integrated into a coherent mental model. Future research should manipulate the presence of a unifying context to better evaluate this hypothesis.

Session structure

All study sessions shared the same basic structure: practice, calibration, and testing (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Study session design.

Each cell represents a condition in the experiment that pairs a report order and report context. Calibration was performed in each session, allowing us to fix stimulus properties in the testing phase. Hypothesis testing included trials from the testing phase only.

Practice

A practice phase was used to (re)-familiarise the participant with the assigned report order and context. During practice, the participant used the assigned report order (e.g. D → C) to complete trials in the assigned context (e.g. time limited). Practice trials spanned a range of difficulties from easy to hard, and performance feedback was provided.

### Ending this pandemic and securing the future [^ebc2642a]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

In December it will be two years since the first cases of covid-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, and one year since the first clinical trial results showed that the world had developed an effective vaccine. In May 2021, The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response put forward a package of vital reforms required to end the current pandemic and better secure the future. Six months later, is the world is better placed to respond to future pandemics or indeed to end this current one?

The short answer is no. There are reasons for optimism in some areas, but the urgency and pace of change does not meet the needs of the moment — to respond quickly and effectively to a disease that has killed more than five million people worlwide. The world is still dangerously unprepared for the next pandemic threat. This collection of nine papers draws on the analytical work that contributed to the panel's recommendations. Together, this collection shows how, why, and where the world and individual countries succeeded or failed against covid-19 and points to solutions that can end the covid-19 pandemic and make it the last pandemic of such devastation.

Key opportunities for progress have been squandered. The recent G20 meeting in Italy failed to deliver. Rather than urgently redistributing vaccine doses and delivering financing for pandemic preparedness, the outcome was yet another task force.

Our panel report in May called for one billion vaccine doses to be redistributed from high income to low income countries by 1 September. High income countries have failed to meet that target. While wealthy countries roll out booster programmes, low and middle income countries' ability to purchase vaccines is being squeezed: at the time of writing, fewer than 5% of people in low income countries had received a single dose. Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados has asked the right question of her fellow heads of government: "How many more deaths must it take before the. excess vaccines in the possession of the advanced countries of the world will be shared with those who [have] simply no access to vaccines?"

### Saccadic eye movements in neurological disease: cognitive mechanisms and clinical applications [^8707b5ec]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The switch cost

In the AS task, the inhibition of the reflexive saccade has been shown to have lingering effects on subsequent PS when these tasks are interleaved — that is, when a person is asked to perform a PS task immediately after being asked to perform an AS task in consecutive trials. This so-called switch cost has been demonstrated in several studies and is thought to be mediated by a residual inhibitory response state after an AS is performed. This ultimately results in increased latency when there is a subsequent switch to a PS task. This switch cost is generally considered unidirectional in that a PS task preceding an AS task does not influence the latency of the latter. Interleaving the PS and AS tasks provides further opportunity to detect impairments in cognitive control, where increased susceptibility to task switching might reflect impairments to working memory and response inhibition.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ce29585f]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Disparities in breast cancer outcomes — Mortality from breast cancer is highest for Black women; even when accounting for differences in age and stage at diagnosis, mortality is approximately 40% higher for Black women (5-year age-adjusted mortality rate, 27.6 per 100 000 women) compared with White women (5-year age-adjusted mortality rate, 19.7 per 100 000 women). Black women have a higher incidence of breast cancer with at least 1 negative molecular marker, and the incidence of triple-negative cancers (ER-, PR-, and HER2-) is twice as high compared with White women (24.2 vs 12.3 cases per 100 000 women). The higher incidence of negative hormonal receptor status leads to worse outcomes because these subtypes are less readily detected through screening and less responsive to current therapy. Residential segregation driven by discriminatory housing policies has been associated with increased exposure to toxic environments and decreased access to healthy foods, and neighborhood disadvantage has been associated with both an increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer and poorer breast cancer–specific survival in Black women. Although variation in cancer subtype incidence explains some mortality differences, racial differences in mortality within subtypes point to barriers to obtaining high-quality health care and to disparities in screening follow-up and treatment initiation as contributors.

### The temporal dynamics of metacognitive experiences track rational adaptations in task performance [^ba3914f7]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Human task performance elicits diverse subjective metacognitive experiences, such as boredom, effort, fatigue, and frustration, which are considered to play important roles in the monitoring and regulation of cognitive processes. Yet, their specific contributions to task performance remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the temporal dynamics underlying these metacognitive experiences and latent cognitive processes supporting task performance. We used a time-on-task design using a conflict task and analyzed the data using a comprehensive approach encompassing behavioral, model-based, subjective, and neural measures (N = 111). Our results show that changes in cognitive processes can be understood as a rational attempt to optimize task performance and that distinct metacognitive experiences are related to different aspects of this rational endeavor. These findings suggest that metacognitive experiences act as tools for humans to gain insights into the optimality of their cognitive performance.

### Intrinsic and task-evoked network architectures of the human brain [^0482d11d]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Many functional network properties of the human brain have been identified during rest and task states, yet it remains unclear how the two relate. We identified a whole-brain network architecture present across dozens of task states that was highly similar to the resting-state network architecture. The most frequent functional connectivity strengths across tasks closely matched the strengths observed at rest, suggesting this is an "intrinsic", standard architecture of functional brain organization. Furthermore, a set of small but consistent changes common across tasks suggests the existence of a task-general network architecture distinguishing task states from rest. These results indicate the brain's functional network architecture during task performance is shaped primarily by an intrinsic network architecture that is also present during rest, and secondarily by evoked task-general and task-specific network changes. This establishes a strong relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity-areas of neuroscientific inquiry typically considered separately.

### The capacity limits of moving objects in the imagination [^a16ce3b4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The task was to indicate when a ball touches the ground. Response keys were spatially mapped to avoid confusion: 'F' for balls left of the wall, and 'J' for balls right of the wall (in Experiment 5, balls that move towards the left or right sides of the screen, respectively). No feedback was given following button presses. Each combination of true impact time and ball movement type was presented 8 times (4 on each side, randomized order), for a total of 64 experimental trials, presented in 2 blocks with a self-timed break between them.

Prior to the test trials, participants went through a pre-task phase, including instructions, practice trials, and a multiple-choice quiz. Each question in the quiz focused on a different aspect of the task (the goal, when animations terminate, how to be most accurate, and response mapping). If a participant failed to respond correctly to any of the 4 quiz questions, they were removed from further analysis. We next provide details specific to the setup of each Experiment.

### Distributing task-related neural activity across a cortical network through task-independent connections [^d733eab4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Task-related neural activity is widespread across populations of neurons during goal-directed behaviors. However, little is known about the synaptic reorganization and circuit mechanisms that lead to broad activity changes. Here we trained a subset of neurons in a spiking network with strong synaptic interactions to reproduce the activity of neurons in the motor cortex during a decision-making task. Task-related activity, resembling the neural data, emerged across the network, even in the untrained neurons. Analysis of trained networks showed that strong untrained synapses, which were independent of the task and determined the dynamical state of the network, mediated the spread of task-related activity. Optogenetic perturbations suggest that the motor cortex is strongly-coupled, supporting the applicability of the mechanism to cortical networks. Our results reveal a cortical mechanism that facilitates distributed representations of task-variables by spreading the activity from a subset of plastic neurons to the entire network through task-independent strong synapses.

### Survey-based analysis of fundamental tasks for effective use of electrosurgical instruments [^2eb6fb2e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use of electrosurgical instruments, there are no widely accepted tasks for training and evaluation of technical skills. The purpose of this study is to propose a set of tasks and report experts' evaluations of the proposed tasks for validity, technical skills versus knowledge requirements, and utility for future privileging curricula.

Methods

A set of seven hands-on tasks involving electrical energy were identified based on the fundamental use of surgical energy (FUSE) curriculum of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons. A web-based survey was developed based on the seven identified tasks, with seven questions asked for each task. These questions rated candidate tasks on their suitability for validation studies, the role of manual skills, and the appropriateness of including the task in privileging curricula. Members of the FUSE committee were sent the web-based survey, and responses were recorded.

Results

Of the 27 members of the FUSE committee, 16 responded to the survey. A total of 775 Likert-style responses were recorded and quantified to a 1–5 range. Overall, responses within task-question pairs had a mean standard deviation of 0.83, suggesting general agreement. Tasks requiring bi-manual dexterity scored higher than single-handed tasks on a combined, four-question Likert-scale index for task validation (p < 0.0001), and a two-question index for manual skills (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Survey responses indicated general agreement that the identified tasks represent important technical skills and are consistent with actions in the operating room. Bimanual tasks were favored for validation purposes over single-handed tasks. The traction and monopolar dissection and monopolar coaptation tasks had the highest agreement with validation-oriented questions (97 and 87%, respectively).

### Personally salient, emotionally negative task contexts provoke goal neglect in depression [^c7251d2e]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate this possibility we adapted the SET by making the six sub-tasks both emotionally-relevant and self-referent. We developed two versions of this new task – the Affective Six Elements Test (A-SET) – one with six positive sub-tasks and one with six negative sub-tasks. Instructions were the same as those in the Hotel Task variant of the SET, with participants instructed to attempt each sub-task in the given time and to organize their time between the six-subtasks evenly, with the option to check a clock to aid time-management.

We anticipated that depressed individuals would exhibit an overall impairment in A-SET performance, regardless of the task valence, compared to never-depressed individuals. In line with the previous study we are drawing from (Manly et al.), our primary outcome of interest was the number of tasks attempted. Specifically, we hypothesised that depressed individuals would be (i) more likely to neglect entire sub-tasks, (ii) would show greater deviation from the optimal time they allocate to each task, and (iii) would check the clock less frequently than never-depressed peers. We further hypothesised that (iv) those with depression would perform more poorly than controls on these outcomes for the negative version of the task relative to the positive version.

Values and actions in the experiment.

A Schematic layout of the decision structure in the robber task. B Schematic layout of the decision structure in the factory task. C Offers and costs in the tasks. The x-axis shows the offers for each task. In the robber task, the offer is the amount of the tip that the participants may earn at the end of the night before encountering the robber. The three blue lines show the values of the active choice (if successful) at the different cost regimes employed in the tasks. The red lines show the value of the passive choice. The dots show the specific values present in the task. D Same as D but for the factory task. In the factory task, the offers are the possible losses that the participant incurs if they let the machine break. E Decisions over trials in the first block of the robber task. The mean probability of choosing the active option over trials with the same stimulus is shown for different success probabilities (colours in the legend in the top plots and G), in data (top; N = 279) and in simulated behaviour (middle and bottom). The line shown in the bottom two plots and the opacity of the lines indicate the percentage of participants that encountered each success probability on each trial, as the number of times each participant encountered each of the success probabilities ranged from 4 (100%) to 8 (11%) trials. The lines thereby signal the increased uncertainty in the estimates, since not all participants encountered all stimuli eight times. The middle and bottom plots show mean model behaviour across 1000 simulations, simulated with the participants' parameter values and design matrix (order of success probability, offers, costs and trials per stimuli) with the Bayesian learner (middle) and Static probability model (bottom) fitted to the first block of the robber task. F Same as E for the first block of the factory task (N = 279) and replacing the basic Static probability model with the Static probability model with bias (φ) parameter. G Example stimuli that the participants could encounter in the first block of either task, along with the success probabilities that were assigned to each stimulus. The order of the stimulus presentation and the association of stimuli to success probabilities was randomised for each participant. Participants encountered each stimulus in four to eight consecutive trials. Six of the stimuli were encountered four times, three stimuli five times, and one stimulus six, seven and eight times. The number of encounters for each stimulus was balanced over the block by splitting the number of encounters into two counterbalanced lists and shuffling the number of encounters within the lists.

### Dynamically shifting from compositional to conjunctive brain representations supports cognitive task learning [^af3affcd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

During cognitive task learning, neural representations must be rapidly constructed for novel task performance, then optimized for robust practiced task performance. How the geometry of neural representations changes to enable this transition from novel to practiced performance remains unknown. We hypothesized that practice involves a shift from compositional representations (task-general activity patterns that can be flexibly reused across tasks) to conjunctive representations (task-specific activity patterns specialized for the current task). Functional MRI during learning of multiple complex tasks substantiated this dynamic shift from compositional to conjunctive representations, which was associated with reduced cross-task interference (via pattern separation) and behavioral improvement. Further, we found that conjunctions originated in subcortex (hippocampus and cerebellum) and slowly spread to cortex, extending multiple memory systems theories to encompass cognitive task learning. The strengthening of conjunctive representations hence serves as a computational signature of learning, reflecting cortical-subcortical dynamics that optimize task representations in the human brain.

### Orthogonal representations for robust context-dependent task performance in brains and neural networks [^f4581b0d]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

How do neural populations code for multiple, potentially conflicting tasks? Here we used computational simulations involving neural networks to define "lazy" and "rich" coding solutions to this context-dependent decision-making problem, which trade off learning speed for robustness. During lazy learning the input dimensionality is expanded by random projections to the network hidden layer, whereas in rich learning hidden units acquire structured representations that privilege relevant over irrelevant features. For context-dependent decision-making, one rich solution is to project task representations onto low-dimensional and orthogonal manifolds. Using behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans and analysis of neural signals from macaque prefrontal cortex, we report evidence for neural coding patterns in biological brains whose dimensionality and neural geometry are consistent with the rich learning regime.

### Decoding task specific and task general functional architectures of the brain [^8fd027a0]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

The DMN has been characterized as a "task negative" network and it plays a role in extended support of internal mentation processes (Fox et al; Kelly, Uddin, Biswal, Castellanos, & Milham,) and observing internal and/or external environment (Gao, Gilmore, Alcauter, & Lin). The CO task control, FP task control, and the salience networks help in configuring the brain to different brain states, and configuring information processing in response to different task demands. These networks thus support varied cognitive functions including sensory perception and motor control. The FP task control network acts as a flexible hub for cognitive control facilitating special attention to trial specific information (Marek & Dosenbach,) whereas the CO task control network maintains alertness during task performance and correction based on feedback from each trial (Cocchi, Zalesky, Fornito, & Mattingley). The salience network determines the importance given to different stimuli for the brain to act and is known to be widely activated across different tasks (Seeley et al.). Our results are thus in line with the widely known task related deactivations that are observed in the DMN (Buckner, Andrews‐Hanna, & Schacter,) and the memory retrieval systems (Fox et al; Power et al.) while the FP task‐control, CO task‐control and ventral attention systems are known for their task related activations (Cole, Repovš, & Anticevic; Corbetta, Kincade, Ollinger, McAvoy, & Shulman; Power et al.).

### Abstract representations emerge naturally in neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks [^a752f724]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The multi-tasking model produces abstract representations when trained with reinforcement learning.

a Schematic of the reinforcement learning multi-tasking model, using the deep deterministic policy gradient approach. b The performance of the network on different tasks over the course of training. Note the sharp transitions between near-chance performance (avg reward = 0) and near-perfect performance (avg reward = 1). c The fraction of tasks learned such that avgreward > 0.8 for different numbers of trained tasks, the shading is the standard error of the mean and there are n = 10 models included in the analysis. d The classifier (left) and regression (right) generalization performance of the reinforcement learning multi-tasking model.

While the reinforcement learning multi-tasking model learns the tasks less reliably than the supervised multi-tasking model (Fig. 7 b, c), it still produces fully abstract representations for around ten trained tasks (D = 5, Fig. 7 d). Interestingly, while some tasks are not successfully learned during the allotted training time, the learned tasks transition from near-chance performance to near-perfect performance within just a few training epochs (Fig. 7 b). This suggests that additional hyperparameter tuning could potentially improve task learning consistency and push the representations to be even more strongly abstract with fewer trained tasks. However, such extensive tuning is out of the current scope of this work.

### A generalized reward processing deficit pathway to negative symptoms across diagnostic boundaries [^251a98dd]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Experimental tasks

Participants completed an online battery of experimental tasks assessing distinct aspects of reward processing that are believed to contribute to negative symptoms (Strauss et al; Strauss & Cohen,): (1) a hedonic reactivity task requiring self-report ratings of positive valence in response to pleasant images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,); (2) a probabilistic reinforcement learning task (PRLT; Gold et al.) assessing explicit learning from gains and losses; (3) a value representation task assessing the subjective value of a hypothetical future reward as a function of its magnitude and delay in delivery (delay discounting task; Kirby, Petry, & Bickel,); and (4) an effort–cost computation task in which participants had to choose between completing a lower effort task for a smaller reward or a higher effort task for a larger reward (effort expenditure for reward task; EEfRT; Treadway et al.). Task paradigms assessing these reward-processing constructs were selected based on prior evidence of performance deficits in CHR and/or schizophrenia samples (Barch et al; Bartolomeo et al; Strauss et al; Strauss, Ruiz, Visser, Crespo, & Dickinson). For the reinforcement learning and effort–cost computation tasks, participants in each group were randomized to task versions using either points-based or monetary rewards, and performance differences between task versions were examined to rule out systematic differences (described below). See thefor a description of each task and the computation of dependent variables.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents: a practice parameter [^4a96fe60]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Rodent allergen exposure characteristics in laboratory settings — particle size, workload effects, and high-exposure tasks: Allergens in animal facilities primarily occur as particles less than 10 μm in diameter, and the concentration of airborne animal allergens is proportionate to the number of animals in the room. Allergen levels are twice as high on Mondays as on other days because of the tasks performed on those days, and filters on animal cages can substantially reduce airborne allergen levels. The highest personal exposure occurs when contaminated bedding and high numbers of conscious animals are handled, and high exposure to mouse urinary protein was associated with handling mice, indirect contact with mice, and washing floors; positive skin prick, specific IgE, and inhalation test reactions have been demonstrated to mouse urine proteins.

### Abstract representations emerge naturally in neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks [^1d89b63f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Abstract representations only emerge when task-relevant

Abstract representations for the latent variables do not emerge when the multi-tasking model is trained to perform random, highly nonlinear tasks. This follows what would be expected in the natural world: latent variables are learned as a way to solve multiple related tasks and to generalize knowledge from one task to another, rather than for their own sake. Then, we show that abstract representations are recovered when the multi-tasking model learns a combination of latent variable-aligned and unaligned tasks.

First, we construct grid classification tasks, in which the latent variable space is divided into grid chambers, where each chamber has a roughly equal probability of being sampled (Fig. 4 a, red lines). Then, we randomly assign each of the grid chambers to one of two categories (Fig. 4 a, coloring; see "Grid classification tasks" in Methods for more details). In this case, there is nothing in the design of the multi-tasking model that privileges a representation of the original latent variables, since they are no longer useful for learning to perform the multiple grid classification tasks. Consequently, the multi-tasking model does not recover a representation of the original latent variables (Fig. 4 b, c).

### Inefficient prioritization of task-relevant attributes during instrumental information demand [^bf65527f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sampling strategies are inconsistent across tasks

A possible explanation for the inefficient sampling we find is that participants failed to identify informative observations based on the reasoning in Fig. 1b. Two aspects of our findings support this interpretation.

First, had participants identified the optimal strategy, we would expect them to sample identically in the two instrumental conditions in which this strategy was incentivized. Contrary to this view, sampling showed significant differences between the Intervene and Estimate tasks. Participants who consistently pursued EV-sensitive strategies had higher value sensitivity in the Intervene relative to the Estimate task (Fig. 3b, middle panel; paired differences in parameter b, 1.70 ± 0.232; p < 0.001 two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test vs 0, n = 265 participants) as also found in those who pursued EV-sensitive strategies in some of the tasks (detailed statistics in Fig. S 3a, b). We found no credible evidence of correlations between the task effects on parameters a and b (task difference between the Intervene and Estimate task in parameter a versus the difference in parameter b, Spearman's r = 0.06, p = 0.319, n = 256 participants). Uncertainty-only participants had higher uncertainty sensitivity in the Intervene vs the Estimate task (detailed statistics in Fig. S 3a, b). Thus, although the optimal sampling strategy was identical in all tasks, participants made task-specific adjustments in their sampling strategy including independent adjustments in uncertainty and EV sensitivity.

### Using an ordinary differential equation model to separate rest and task signals in fMRI [^542df114]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In our experimental paradigm, the ACM aligns with the idea that specific Resting State sub-networks are elevated to facilitate task performance. The common network processes, primarily captured by the Rest ODE, can only be removed from the signal if the distinct network processes, represented by the Task ODE, remain intact. We demonstrate this across five behavioral variable tests and fourteen sub-tasks spanning four meta-tasks. In addition, we show that functionally similar tasks yield ODEs with more structurally similar coefficients (see Methods section in Differences between Task Models), allowing for greater interchangeability and improved isolation of task-specific processes via ACM separation. This is further supported by our use of metatask models to decode individual sub-tasks, where we only had sufficient data to train meta models, but were able to apply to each of these sub-tasks individually. These findings suggest the existence of a fixed set of sub-networks, with each task selectively engaging specific processes for task execution. Furthermore, we identify sigmoidal relationships between network regions, consistent with previous literature, which could lead to stimulus quenching when these sub-networks are elevated in activity to perform a given task.

Our results also align with prior models of Task using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) that have assumed that Task activation is replicable when observing across multiple stimuli, whereas Rest processes are more randomly distributed. This assumption has allowed these models to statistically identify the regions where the Task occurs. This aligns with our approach of training separate models for Rest and Task, where during Task, Rest processes that are not associated with the Task appear to be unstructured processes. GLM models also utilize two Task conditions with varying difficulty levels to isolate primary cortical regions responsible for the Task, rather than all regions necessary for Task execution, such as the visual cortex or motor areas involved in button pressing. In our variant of this experiment, by contrasting regions with higher correlation during 0-back vs. 2-back, we identify regions that match Task severity. These regions closely align with areas that show the greatest normalized increase in behavioral performance due to ACM separation (see Supplementary Fig. 11). This suggests that ACM selectively enhances areas responsible for Task severity and difficulty rather than all regions involved in Task execution.

### Dynamics of specialization in neural modules under resource constraints [^a5a7de0f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The goal of our work is to investigate the relationship between structural and functional modularity. To that end, we need to design flexible models, environments, and tasks, upon which we have precise control, to study this relationship in a controlled manner. We also need to understand and measure specialization and to do so we devise metrics that allow us to quantify this elusive concept.

Environment: data and tasks

Conceptually, we think of an environment as composed of underlying variables, some of which are crucial to the task at hand (which we will call decision variables), while the remainder are needed only to fully reconstruct the exact observation but can be discarded when performing the task (irrelevant variables). Put together, those variables fully specify the environment. However, in carrying out a task we are only interested in capturing some high-level features of the world: we therefore define global tasks to be computations on decision variables.

In this framework, recovering the decision variables from a stimulus is what constitutes the sub-tasks: the essential building blocks which can then be used to perform a more general global-task. The precise form of stimulus can vary, representing different sets of irrelevant variables. Changing the nature and structure of this stimulus is what allows us to control how difficult it is to recover a decision variable, hence the difficulty of the sub-tasks. We use (1) pairs of written MNISTdigits (with each digit drawn from the same set), or (2) pairs of EMNIST letters(with each letter drawn from separated subsets). The global task is the precise computation to be performed after decoding the sub-tasks, and can also vary, allowing for control over the amount of cooperation needed by the agents. We train the networks on a parity-based choice:

### Assessing the feasibility and efficacy of virtual reality navigational training for older adults [^3a98d19e]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study evaluates the feasibility of virtual reality (VR) wayfinding training with aging adults and assesses the impact of the training on wayfinding performance.

Research Design and Methods

49 participants were recruited using a convenience sample approach. Wayfinding tasks were conducted by 3 participant groups: active VR training, passive video training, and no training, assigned randomly. The training featured 5 tasks in a digital version of a real building. Post-training assessments used 10 tasks in this same building, half of the tasks familiar from the training and half new. The study was double-blinded, with each intervention lasting 10min. The primary outcomes include the Distance Traveled and Duration for each wayfinding task, with a fixed 10-min limit.

Results

Participants in the VR group reported moderate usability and a high sense of Self Location in the environment with respect to the training intervention. No significant differences were found in performance for the first group of similar wayfinding tasks; however, in the subsequent set of new tasks the VR group significantly outperformed the Control group. This suggests a possible spatial learning effect across multiple exposures (VR training followed by similar task). No adverse effects were reported during or post intervention.

Discussion and Implications

This study provides preliminary evidence that VR training can help to improve wayfinding performance in older adults with no reported adverse effects.

### Dissociable theta networks underlie the switch and mixing costs during task switching [^73bbbdf0]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Cued trials task‐switching paradigm. (a) Structure of the task. Adjacent segments are mapped to the colour, letter, or digit task. An example of stimulus–response mapping is also shown. (b) Trial example. A cue highlights two adjacent segments (corresponding here to the letter task) for 1,000 ms. After 1,000 ms, the cue is replaced by a target that appears in one of the highlighted segments. Participants respond to the target and 400 ms after the response the next trial's cue appears. (c) The subsequent trial (N) could be (i) a repeat trial, that is, the same two segments will be highlighted and the same task will be performed, or (ii) a switch trial, that is, the cue will highlight two segments associated with one of the other two tasks and validly indicates which of these tasks the participant will be required to perform on the target

There are two types of task blocks: single‐task blocks and mixed‐task blocks. Single‐task blocks include only one task per block (i.e. colour, number or letter), whereas mixed‐task blocks included trials from all three tasks in a pseudorandom order. Task‐switching trial types were defined by the location of the cue on the current trial (trial N) with respect to the preceding trial (trial N − 1; Figure 1c). Repeat cues highlighted the two segments associated with the task on the prior trial, indicating that the upcoming trial would repeat the same task. Switch cues highlighted both segments of a task that was not completed on the prior trial, indicating that the upcoming trial would require a switch in task and identifying which task the participant will be switching to. In single‐task blocks, the cue remained in the same position throughout the block, indicating that the same task was to be repeated (all‐repeat trials). In mixed‐task blocks, on mixed‐repeat trials (25%; Figure 1c‐i), the cue remained in the same position on consecutive trials. Thus, mixed‐repeat trials were identical to all‐repeat trials but occurred in a mixed‐task block. That is, they were interspersed with switch trials (25%; Figure 1c ‐ii) on which the cue changed position and highlighted segments associated with one of the other two tasks.

### Transfer learning with kernel methods [^2b09e1f7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Transfer learning refers to the process of adapting a model trained on a source task to a target task. While kernel methods are conceptually and computationally simple models that are competitive on a variety of tasks, it has been unclear how to develop scalable kernel-based transfer learning methods across general source and target tasks with possibly differing label dimensions. In this work, we propose a transfer learning framework for kernel methods by projecting and translating the source model to the target task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in applications to image classification and virtual drug screening. For both applications, we identify simple scaling laws that characterize the performance of transfer-learned kernels as a function of the number of target examples. We explain this phenomenon in a simplified linear setting, where we are able to derive the exact scaling laws.

### Targeted time-varying functional connectivity [^193d2426]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Real Data

We used 7 T fMRI data with a TR of 0.576 s, collected from 60 participants during three 10‐min task sessions (Hearne et al.). The participants were tasked with a non‐verbal relational reasoning paradigm comprising problems of varying difficulty levels categorized as null, binary, ternary, and quaternary based on relational complexity. Each condition consisted of 36 trials totalling 2160 trials across subjects. As outlined in Hearne et al. task performance decreased with increasing complexity, with increased errors and response time attributed to task demands rather than temporary lapses in attention or disengagement. Correct responses represent 96% for binary trials, 87% for ternary trials, and 65% for quaternary trials. Participants demonstrated a success rate of 96% on null trials, further indicating sustained attentiveness and task engagement.

### Making brain-machine interfaces robust to future neural variability [^cd643c97]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In the Random Target Task each trial's target appeared at a random location within a 20 cm × 20 cm region centred within a larger workspace that was 40 × 30 cm. A new random target appeared after each trial regardless of whether this trial was a success or a failure due to exceeding the 5 s time limit. The target location randomization enforced a rule that the new target's acceptance area could not overlap with that of the previous target. Performance on the Random Target Task was measured by success rate (the number of successfully acquired targets divided by the total number of presented targets) and the normalized time to target. Normalized time to target is calculated for successful trials following another successful trial, and is the duration between target presentation and target acquisition (not including the 500 ms hold time), divided by the straight-line distance between this target's centre and the previously acquired target's centre.

### Dynamic categorization rules alter representations in human visual cortex [^316c8afc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We then compared Linear-1 confidence and Linear-2 confidence across the Linear-1 and Linear-2 tasks (Fig. 7). Overall, both types of confidence were highest for trials furthest from the boundary (Fig. 7A), followed by near trials (Fig. 7B). This pattern is expected given that shapes further from the boundary are more distinctive from one another, while shapes nearer to the boundary are more ambiguous. In addition, this analysis revealed effects of task condition that differed for near and far trials. For trials in the far group, a three-way repeated measures ANOVA showed main effects of ROI and confidence boundary (i.e. Linear-1 confidence versus Linear-2 confidence), but no main effect of task or interaction between task and boundary (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting that discriminability of shapes across the Linear-1 and Linear-2 boundaries did not differ across tasks for this group of trials. For the near trials, however, there was also a significant interaction between task and boundary (Supplementary Table 5). When each boundary was examined separately for each of these trial groups, we found a main effect of task on Linear-2 confidence for the near trials (two-way repeated measures ANOVA on near trials; ROI: F (7,63) = 30.05, p < 0.001; Task: F (1,9) = 13.65, p = 0.005; ROI × Task: F (7,63) = 0.36, p = 0.925), with Linear-2 confidence showing higher values for the Linear-2 task, across all ROIs, than the Linear-1 task. As with the previous analyses, the effect of task was larger for the Linear-2 boundary than for the Linear-1 boundary — there was no main effect of task seen for the Linear-1 confidence values for near trials (ROI: F (7,63) = 23.58, p < 0.001; Task: F (1,9) = 0.10, p = 0.757; ROI × Task: F (7,63) = 0.62, p = 0.751). As a further test, we also performed a version of this classifier confidence analysis using the output of the simpler binary classifiers presented earlier (Supplementary Fig. 3). This revealed the same pattern of results, namely an interaction between the classifier boundary and the task, in which Linear-2 confidence values were significantly higher when computed from the Linear-2 task versus the Linear-1 task. This indicates that the difference in classifier confidence across tasks is not dependent on the classifier training method used.

### Testing effective connectivity changes with structural equation modeling: what does a bad model tell us? [^ea22d5a8]. Human Brain Mapping (2006). Low credibility.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical method that can assess changes in effective connectivity across tasks or between groups. In its initial application to neuroimaging data, anatomical connectivity provided the constraints to decompose interregional covariances to estimate effective connections. There have been concerns expressed, however, with the validity of interpreting effective connections for a model that does not adequately fit the data. We sought to address this concern by creating two population networks with different patterns of effective connectivity, extracting three samples sizes (N = 100, 60, 20), and then assessing whether the ability to detect effective connectivity differences depended on absolute model fit. Four scenarios were assessed: (1) elimination of a region showing no task differences; (2) elimination of connections with no task differences; (3) elimination of connections that carried task differences, but could be expressed through alternative indirect routes; (4) elimination of connections that carried task differences, and could not be expressed through indirect routes. We were able to detect task differences in all four cases, despite poor absolute model fit. In scenario 3, total effects captured the overall task differences even though the direct effect was no longer present. In scenario 4, task differences that were included in the model remained, but the missing effect was not expressed. In conclusion, it seems that when independent information (e.g., anatomical connectivity) is used to define the causal structure in SEM, inferences about task- or group-dependent changes are valid regardless of absolute model fit.

### Neural knowledge assembly in humans and neural networks [^5b92ab4e]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether participants were asked to select the more or less brispy object, and hemifield presentation of the objects, were randomised on each trial. Additionally, the trial-order of each object pair was randomly shuffled. Participants performed this task for a minimum of 3 cycles (3 blocks per context, for 6 total blocks), and were trained until they reached a criterion of at least 90% correct on each block of the last cycle (e.g. more than 90% accurate on each of the two previously performed blocks, where one was from each context). Additionally, participants had to select the correct answer on the final 20% of trials (12) within each context. On average, it took participants 5 ± 2 cycles (mean ± SD) to learn the task, and one participant was excluded for failing to reach criterion after 10 cycles of training (see Figure 1 C).

The format of the test phases test short and test long was identical (but different to train short). Test phases occurred in the scanner, and consisted of 288 trials (4 blocks of 72 trials each) in which lone objects were presented in a random sequence, with the constraint that each combination of 12 (current trial) x 12 (previous trial) ranked objects occurred exactly once in the first half (144 trials) and once in the second half (144 trials) of the test phase. Each object was presented centrally for 750 ms, after which participants had 2000 ms to respond whether it was more or less brispy than the previous object. Participants were instructed about the mapping from more/less to left/right buttons (held in either hand) before each block of trials, and this mapping stayed consistent for 2 blocks, and then was switched midway through the test phase. After participants responded, there was a pseudo-randomly jittered interval of 1500–5500 ms, during which the fixation dot turned blue if a response was recorded within this deadline, while a red letter X appeared if the response was missed. Critically, participants did not receive trial-wise feedback and instead were rewarded bonus points at the end of each block. These bonus points were proportional to their accuracy on that block and were translated into additional monetary reward at the end of the experiment. Timings for test were chosen to assist with BOLD modelling.

### Reinforcement learning of adaptive control strategies [^636cb99a]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In sum, we provide evidence that congruency-specific control strategies can be subject to reinforcement learning, extending previous studies that focused on the reinforcement of stimulus, response, and task values. Through modelling, we show that people most likely optimized control by strategically shifting their decision boundary in a congruency-specific manner. At the same time, our findings also suggest that reinforcement learning at the lowest available level (i.e. increasing stimulus value) is still the preferred, default strategy guiding control adaptations, resulting in stronger and faster changes in performance. This fits with the broader ideas that reinforcement learning of abstract control strategies can only follow the slower process of abstraction (i.e. requiring exposure to multiple stimuli) and meta-learning, and that the strategies on which it operates are considered more costly.

### Specific frontal neural dynamics contribute to decisions to check [^28d5b973]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Behaviour

We designed a behavioural task to assess how monkeys checked for information during ongoing task behaviour. The task design is based on a dual-task principle (Fig. 1a). On each trial, monkeys can either select the triangle stimulus to 'Work' and perform a delayed visual categorization task (Fig. 1 and Methods, referred hereafter to the main task) or select the disk stimulus to 'Check' and see whether a bonus reward is available. If they choose to work in the main task, they are shown a cue stimulus (a rightward or leftward bar oriented at various angles) and, after a delay, have to categorize its side of orientation by selecting a target on the right or on the left (this Right versus Left decision is called Cued decision). The main task has three levels of difficulty and requires cue-based decision-making. By contrast, choosing the disk stimulus provides information on how soon a bonus reward will be delivered, as indicated by a visual gauge, which gradually fills up. The bonus is delivered only if the monkey checks when the gauge is full. It is noteworthy that if the gauge becomes full it remains full until the monkey checks the bonus option. Good performance in the main task increases the level of the gauge, bringing the bonus closer to delivery. Specifically, the number of correct trials necessary to get the bonus varies pseudo-randomly in successive blocks (from 14, 21, 28 or 36 trials) and the gauge increases in 7 steps (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, one way of improving reward income overall consists of performing well in the main task and also in checking once in a while to gather information on bonus availability. It is noteworthy that no explicit information is given regarding a putative need to check or the value of checking, apart from the gauge presented at the monkeys' request.

### Assessment of dual tasking has no clinical value for fall prediction in Parkinson's disease [^80bd6962]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Falling is a common and incapacitating complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). Even in early disease stages a considerable number of patients with PD fall. To identify these fallers, it is necessary to develop a sensitive and specific measure to predict which patients are at high risk of future falls in a timely manner. This is still not adequately possible using existing prediction algorithms.

Lundin-Olsson was the first to demonstrate that older people who stop walking while talking had a higher risk of falling than those who are able to continue walking. Since then, the dual-task paradigm has been regarded as a promising way to discriminate between people at risk of falls and those who are not. Gait deficits generally call for increased attentional demands in order to maintain stability and prevent stumbling. A well-proven paradigm to assess attentional demands of gait is to add a secondary cognitive task and to compute the cost of dual tasking. That is, performing a cognitive task while walking leads to a situation in which two tasks compete for the same attentional resources. When the attentional demands of both tasks together exceed the available capacity, the performance of one or both tasks will deteriorate compared to the respective single-task performance.

In patients with PD, dual-task situations are thought to be especially challenging since executive function is often impaired even in early stages of the disease. Specifically, PD affects the ability to flexibly switch from one attentional set to another. Impaired set-shifting further complicates dual-task situations in which attention needs to be properly allocated to the tasks at hand. When people are walking and are concurrently engaged in a cognitive task, the most sensible strategy to maintain stability is to prioritize posture, thereby decreasing the risk of falling. This notion is called the 'posture first hypothesis'. However, Bloem and colleagues found that patients with PD actually gave less priority to motor tasks than healthy participants, possibly placing them at a higher risk of falls.

In healthy people, gait adaptations under dual-task conditions include slowing of gait speed and reducing stride length. The same adaptations have been observed in patients with PD, but their gait variability is also increased under dual-task conditions. Furthermore, gait variability in a single-task condition has been associated with fall risks in PD. Taken together, this has led to the suggestion that increased gait variability under dual-task conditions may be a predictor of falling in patients with PD.

### Working memory and postural control: adult age differences in potential for improvement, task priority, and dual tasking [^b255a215]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

We investigate dynamic posture control and working memory (NBack) retest practice in young and older adults, focusing on older adults' potential for improvement in the component tasks but more importantly in dual-task performance. Participants performed the 2 tasks in 11 sessions under single- and dual-task conditions. Posture improvement was observed with retest practice for both groups. Increase in cognitive load after initial practice led to greater dual-task costs in both tasks in older adults and higher costs in memory in young adults. With continued practice, costs were reduced by both groups; however, the 2 groups focused improvement on different tasks: Older adults focused on posture but young adults on cognition. These results emphasize older adults' potential for improvement in dual-task performance and their flexibility to utilize the practice gains in posture to optimize cognitive performance.

### Cognitive control mechanisms resolve conflict through cortical amplification of task-relevant information [^fb9e0294]. Nature Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

A prominent model of how the brain regulates attention proposes that the anterior cingulate cortex monitors the occurrence of conflict between incompatible response tendencies and signals this information to a cognitive control system in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cognitive control is thought to resolve conflict through the attentional biasing of perceptual processing, emphasizing task-relevant stimulus information. It is not known, however, whether conflict resolution is mediated by amplifying neural representations of task-relevant information, inhibiting representations of task-irrelevant information, or both. Here we manipulated trial-by-trial levels of conflict and control during a Stroop task using face stimuli, while recording hemodynamic responses from human visual cortex specialized for face processing. We show that, in response to high conflict, cognitive control mechanisms enhance performance by transiently amplifying cortical responses to task-relevant information rather than by inhibiting responses to task-irrelevant information. These results implicate attentional target-feature amplification as the primary mechanism for conflict resolution through cognitive control.
