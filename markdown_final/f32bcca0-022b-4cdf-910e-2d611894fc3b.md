## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 60-year-old woman with epigastric pain radiating to the back, CT-confirmed pancreatitis, and a very low lipase, seeking a prioritized differential diagnosis and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is truly established despite the low lipase. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies given the absence of gallstones and alcohol. Next, I will consider alternative diagnoses that could mimic pancreatitis or coexist, especially with the respiratory findings. After that, I need to assess severity and complications to guide disposition and monitoring. Finally, I will outline immediate management, targeted etiologic workup, and follow-up imaging strategy, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, because I need to ensure we are not anchoring on imaging alone when the lipase is not elevated threefold. The standard diagnostic criteria require two of three: typical abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings; here, the pain is classic and the CT is characteristic, but the lipase of 18 U/L is not greater than three times normal, so strictly speaking we meet two of three and the diagnosis is acceptable, though the discordant lipase warrants caution and follow-up labs to exclude assay or timing issues [^111nkKSU] [^1112MVtk].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of a normal or mildly elevated lipase in a patient with convincing imaging and clinical features. Lipase can be normal in late presentations, in hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis, or due to assay variability; given the triglyceride level here is only 122 mg/dL, hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is unlikely, so the discordance most plausibly reflects timing or a nonenzymatic process, and the diagnosis remains valid with close laboratory reassessment rather than immediate dismissal of pancreatitis [^116VBxuw].

> I will now examine the most likely etiology. With no gallstones and no alcohol history, and with diabetes and hyperlipidemia present, idiopathic pancreatitis becomes the leading consideration, but I should double-check for occult biliary microlithiasis or sludge and medication-induced causes, particularly since statins and other lipid-lowering agents have a complex relationship with pancreatitis risk and some drugs can precipitate attacks. Given the absence of red flags for tumor, neoplastic etiology is less likely but not excluded in a 60-year-old, prompting a cautious, guideline-based search for cause [^112MeiVc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the lungs. The bilateral hazy opacities on chest radiograph could reflect pancreatitis-associated pleural effusions or atelectasis, but I should also consider aspiration risk from nausea and NPO status, early community-acquired pneumonia, or even interstitial edema from systemic inflammatory response. Given wheezing on exam and no focal consolidation, an aspiration-related process or reactive airway contribution is plausible, and I need to ensure oxygenation and respiratory monitoring while correlating with inflammatory markers and, if needed, a follow-up chest radiograph or CT [^111hE7nJ].

> Let me consider alternative abdominal diagnoses that can mimic pancreatitis or coexist, even though CT reportedly shows pancreatitis without drainable collections. Peptic ulcer disease with or without perforation, biliary colic or cholangitis, mesenteric ischemia, and even cardiac ischemia masquerading as epigastric pain remain on the table; the absence of peritoneal signs, hemodynamic instability, and ECG ischemia reduces but does not eliminate these threats, so I should maintain vigilance and reassess frequently, especially if pain escalates or new red flags appear [^111jUMNZ] [^116UPRpu].

> Next, I should review severity and complications to guide level of care. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal temperature and adequate oxygenation, but the respiratory rate of 26 is a soft warning for systemic inflammatory response; I should calculate a bedside severity score such as BISAP and track organ function over the first 48–72 hours, because early identification of organ failure changes management and disposition, and persistent organ failure with infected necrosis carries the highest mortality risk [^1112MVtk].

> I need to ensure immediate management aligns with best practice. Aggressive IV isotonic crystalloid resuscitation is foundational, with early, goal-directed fluids in the first 24 hours followed by de-escalation to avoid fluid overload. Pain control with IV opioids is appropriate, and enteral nutrition should be initiated within 24–48 hours once nausea improves, as this reduces infectious complications and need for interventions, while routine early CT is not indicated unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient fails to improve [^117Q8YbJ].

> Let me first confirm the etiologic workup plan. I should obtain fasting lipids after the acute episode settles, serum calcium, liver chemistries with AST/ALT/ALP/GGT and bilirubin, and consider MRCP or EUS if biliary etiology remains suspected despite negative ultrasound, especially for microlithiasis. Given age over 40 with no established cause, I should also keep pancreatic tumor on the radar and pursue cross-sectional imaging and tumor markers if the course is atypical or prolonged, consistent with ACG guidance [^112MeiVc] [^111xYw48].

> But wait, what if the lipase remains low on repeat testing. I should double-check for assay interference, review the timing relative to symptom onset, and consider that some patients, particularly with hypertriglyceridemia or chronic pancreatitis, may have blunted enzyme elevations; repeating lipase and amylase, and correlating with imaging and clinical trajectory, is prudent before revising the diagnosis [^notfound].

> I will now examine the respiratory findings more closely. Given wheezing and tachypnea without hypoxemia, reactive airway changes or early aspiration-related inflammation are reasonable, and I should monitor for evolving effusions or infiltrates; if respiratory status worsens or fever develops, a repeat chest radiograph or chest CT would be justified to evaluate for pleural effusion, aspiration pneumonia, or ARDS, recognizing that severe pancreatitis can precipitate systemic inflammatory complications including pulmonary involvement [^1112MVtk].

> Let me reconsider the top three differential diagnoses to ensure they are prioritized appropriately. First, acute idiopathic pancreatitis remains most likely given classic pain, CT findings, and absence of gallstones or alcohol, with diabetes and hyperlipidemia as background risks. Second, occult biliary microlithiasis or sludge is a key alternative that requires targeted biliary imaging if initial labs and ultrasound are unrevealing. Third, medication-induced pancreatitis, particularly statin-related, should be kept in mind, though causality is complex and requires careful temporal correlation and exclusion of more common etiologies [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm the follow-up and disposition plan. Continued inpatient observation for at least 48–72 hours to monitor for organ failure, trending enzymes, and clinical improvement is appropriate. Escalation to ICU if organ dysfunction develops, early diet advancement as tolerated, and outpatient lipid and calcium assessment with interval imaging if symptoms persist or recur will close the loop, ensuring we neither overcall nor miss evolving complications [^1112MVtk].

The top three differentials for a 60-year-old woman with epigastric pain radiating to the back, CT-confirmed pancreatitis, and a lipase of 18 U/L are **idiopathic pancreatitis** (most likely given normal lipase and no clear cause) [^notfound], **microlithiasis or biliary sludge** (common occult cause despite normal ultrasound) [^notfound], and **medication-induced pancreatitis** (consider GLP-1 agonists, thiazides, or statins) [^notfound]. The normal lipase does not exclude pancreatitis, especially if the presentation is early or due to chronic or hypertriglyceridemia-related disease [^notfound]. Evaluate with **MRCP or EUS**, medication review, and metabolic panels (calcium, triglycerides) [^111xYw48] [^116VBxuw].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Idiopathic pancreatitis

Idiopathic pancreatitis is the most likely diagnosis given the absence of gallstones, alcohol use, or hypertriglyceridemia, and the normal lipase does not exclude pancreatitis — particularly in early or chronic disease [^notfound]. The **pathophysiology** is multifactorial, including genetic predisposition, autoimmune, or occult microlithiasis [^notfound].

---

### Microlithiasis or biliary sludge

Occult gallstones or sludge can cause pancreatitis even with a normal ultrasound; MRCP or EUS increases detection [^notfound]. The **pathophysiology** involves transient obstruction of the pancreatic duct or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [^notfound].

---

### Medication-induced pancreatitis

Medication-induced pancreatitis should be considered, particularly with GLP-1 agonists, thiazide diuretics, or statins. The **pathophysiology** may involve direct toxicity or metabolic effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of normal lipase

- **Early presentation**: Lipase may be normal within the first 24 hours [^notfound].
- **Chronic pancreatitis**: Enzyme levels may be normal or only mildly elevated [^notfound].
- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Lipase activity may be suppressed, yielding falsely normal results [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

1. **MRCP or EUS**: Detect occult microlithiasis or sludge [^notfound]
2. **Medication review**: Identify potential drug-induced pancreatitis [^notfound]
3. **Metabolic panel (calcium, triglycerides)**: Exclude metabolic causes [^116VBxuw]
4. **Autoimmune markers (IgG4, ANA)**: Evaluate autoimmune pancreatitis [^notfound]

---

## Management implications

Management centers on **supportive care** — NPO, IV fluids, and analgesia [^111nkKSU] — with etiologic evaluation to guide prevention of recurrence [^112MeiVc]. If microlithiasis or sludge is found, cholecystectomy or endoscopic sphincterotomy may be indicated [^notfound]; if a medication is implicated, discontinue it and consider alternatives [^notfound].

---

The most likely causes in this patient are **idiopathic pancreatitis**, **microlithiasis or biliary sludge**, and **medication-induced pancreatitis**. A normal lipase does not exclude pancreatitis; further evaluation with MRCP or EUS, medication review, and metabolic testing is recommended [^111xYw48].

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^116Si5YT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^1154LBGw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common yet polymorphic disease that requires clinicians to be vigilant early in the course. From benign, self-limited abdominal pain to a systemic inflammatory syndrome resulting in pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, there is a spectrum of disease. The diagnosis and management of AP is challenging. Through a clinical vignette of inappropriate patient management, we highlight recommendations and advice from the recent guideline for treating this difficult disease.

### Evaluation of artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis of skin neoplasms: a single-center, paralleled, unmasked, randomized controlled trial [^113Lq5EW]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

This was a single-center, unmasked, paralleled, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

A randomized trial was conducted in a tertiary care institute in South Korea to validate whether artificial intelligence (AI) could augment the accuracy of nonexpert physicians in the real-world settings, which included diverse out-of-distribution conditions. Consecutive patients aged > 19 years, having one or more skin lesions suspicious for skin cancer detected by either the patient or physician, were randomly allocated to four nondermatology trainees and four dermatology residents. The attending dermatologists examined the randomly allocated patients with (AI-assisted group) or without (unaided group) the real-time assistance of AI algorithm (https://b2020.modelderm.com#world; convolutional neural networks; unmasked design) after simple randomization of the patients.

Results

Using 576 consecutive cases (Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III or IV) with suspicious lesions out of the initial 603 recruitments, the accuracy of the AI-assisted group (n = 295, 53.9%) was found to be significantly higher than those of the unaided group (n = 281, 43.8%; P = 0.019). Whereas the augmentation was more significant from 54.7% (n = 150) to 30.7% (n = 138; P < 0.0001) in the nondermatology trainees who had the least experience in dermatology, it was not significant in the dermatology residents. The algorithm could help trainees in the AI-assisted group include more differential diagnoses than the unaided group (2.09 vs. 1.95 diagnoses; P = 0.0005). However, a 12.2% drop in Top-1 accuracy of the trainees was observed in cases in which all Top-3 predictions given by the algorithm were incorrect.

Conclusions

The multiclass AI algorithm augmented the diagnostic accuracy of nonexpert physicians in dermatology.

### Evaluation of a large language model's ability to assist in an orthopedic hand clinic [^115XkiAD]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Advancements in artificial intelligence technology, such as OpenAI's large language model, ChatGPT, could transform medicine through applications in a clinical setting. This study aimed to assess the utility of ChatGPT as a clinical assistant in an orthopedic hand clinic.

Methods:

Nine clinical vignettes, describing various common and uncommon hand pathologies, were constructed and reviewed by 4 fellowship-trained orthopedic hand surgeons and an orthopedic resident. ChatGPT was given these vignettes and asked to generate a differential diagnosis, potential workup plan, and provide treatment options for its top differential. Responses were graded for accuracy and the overall utility scored on a 5-point Likert scale.

Results:

The diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT was 7 out of 9 cases, indicating an overall accuracy rate of 78%. ChatGPT was less reliable with more complex pathologies and failed to identify an intentionally incorrect presentation. ChatGPT received a score of 3.8 ± 1.4 for correct diagnosis, 3.4 ± 1.4 for helpfulness in guiding patient management, 4.1 ± 1.0 for appropriate workup for the actual diagnosis, 4.3 ± 0.8 for an appropriate recommended treatment plan for the diagnosis, and 4.4 ± 0.8 for the helpfulness of treatment options in managing patients.

Conclusion:

ChatGPT was successful in diagnosing most of the conditions; however, the overall utility of its advice was variable. While it performed well in recommending treatments, it faced difficulties in providing appropriate diagnoses for uncommon pathologies. In addition, it failed to identify an obvious error in presenting pathology.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

- anesthetic machine malfunction

- anaphylactic reaction

- pheochromocytoma

- thyroid crisis

- cerebral ischemia

- neuromuscular disorders

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain-the big three (an update) [^112PoAtR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate/urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the 3 most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain, acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition and other less common causes of lethal chest pain are also discussed.

### Online symptom checkers are poor tools for diagnosing men's health conditions [^112EjhsL]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the accuracy of the 4 most commonly used online symptom checkers (OSCs) in diagnosing erectile dysfunction (ED), scrotal pain (SP), Peyronie's disease (PD), and low testosterone (LT).

Methods and Outcomes

One-hundred and sixty artificial vignettes were created by de-identifying recent initial outpatient consults presenting to discuss ED (40), SP (40), PD (40), and LT (40). The vignettes were entered into the 4 most frequently used OSCs (WebMD, MedicineNet, EverydayHealth, and SutterHealth) as determined by web traffic analysis tools. The top 5 conditions listed in the OSC differential diagnosis were recorded and scored.

Results

WebMD's accuracy for ED, SP, PD, and LT vignettes was 0%, 22.5%, 0%, and 95%, respectively. EverydayHealth was only able to diagnose SP 20% of the time, and failed to diagnose ED, PD, or LT on all occasions. MedicineNet diagnosed ED, PD, SP, and LT in 100%, 98%, 27.5%, and 0% of vignettes, respectively. SutterHealth correctly diagnosed ED, SP, and LT in 100%, 20%, and 80% of patients, respectively. Cumulatively, the OSCs were most accurate in diagnosing ED and least accurate in diagnosing SP when using the Top 1 (37.5% vs 6.9%) and Top 5 (50% vs 24.5%) of the suggested conditions.

Conclusion

No OSC could accurately diagnose all the conditions tested. The OSCs, on average, were poor at suggesting precise diagnoses for ED, PD, LT, SP. Patients and practitioners should be cautioned regarding the accuracy of OSCs.

### A deep learning system for differential diagnosis of skin diseases [^113dMj5d]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Skin conditions affect 1.9 billion people. Because of a shortage of dermatologists, most cases are seen instead by general practitioners with lower diagnostic accuracy. We present a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions using 16,114 de-identified cases (photographs and clinical data) from a teledermatology practice serving 17 sites. The DLS distinguishes between 26 common skin conditions, representing 80% of cases seen in primary care, while also providing a secondary prediction covering 419 skin conditions. On 963 validation cases, where a rotating panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard, the DLS was non-inferior to six other dermatologists and superior to six primary care physicians (PCPs) and six nurse practitioners (NPs) (top-1 accuracy: 0.66 DLS, 0.63 dermatologists, 0.44 PCPs and 0.40 NPs). These results highlight the potential of the DLS to assist general practitioners in diagnosing skin conditions.

### The large language model chatGPT-4 exhibits excellent triage capabilities and diagnostic performance for patients presenting with various causes of knee pain [^115UcxQn]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide a proof-of-concept analysis of the appropriateness and performance of ChatGPT-4 to triage, synthesize differential diagnoses, and generate treatment plans concerning common presentations of knee pain.

Methods

Twenty knee complaints warranting triage and expanded scenarios were input into ChatGPT-4, with memory cleared prior to each new input to mitigate bias. For the 10 triage complaints, ChatGPT-4 was asked to generate a differential diagnosis that was graded for accuracy and suitability in comparison to a differential created by 2 orthopaedic sports medicine physicians. For the 10 clinical scenarios, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to provide treatment guidance for the patient, which was again graded. To test the higher-order capabilities of ChatGPT-4, further inquiry into these specific management recommendations was performed and graded.

Results

All ChatGPT-4 diagnoses were deemed appropriate within the spectrum of potential pathologies on a differential. The top diagnosis on the differential was identical between surgeons and ChatGPT-4 for 70% of scenarios, and the top diagnosis provided by the surgeon appeared as either the first or second diagnosis in 90% of scenarios. Overall, 16 of 30 diagnoses (53.3%) in the differential were identical. When provided with 10 expanded vignettes with a single diagnosis, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 increased to 100%, with the suitability of management graded as appropriate in 90% of cases. Specific information pertaining to conservative management, surgical approaches, and related treatments was appropriate and accurate in 100% of cases.

Conclusions

ChatGPT-4 provided clinically reasonable diagnoses to triage patient complaints of knee pain due to various underlying conditions that were generally consistent with differentials provided by sports medicine physicians. Diagnostic performance was enhanced when providing additional information, allowing ChatGPT-4 to reach high predictive accuracy for recommendations concerning management and treatment options. However, ChatGPT-4 may show clinically important error rates for diagnosis depending on prompting strategy and information provided; therefore, further refinements are necessary prior to implementation into clinical workflows.

Clinical Relevance

Although ChatGPT-4 is increasingly being used by patients for health information, the potential for ChatGPT-4 to serve as a clinical support tool is unclear. In this study, we found that ChatGPT-4 was frequently able to diagnose and triage knee complaints appropriately as rated by sports medicine surgeons, suggesting that it may eventually be a useful clinical support tool.

### Deep learning-aided decision support for diagnosis of skin disease across skin tones [^11266tLy]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

We found even larger accuracy gains when moving from top-3 accuracy without DLS support to top-4 accuracy with control DLS support on the main eight diseases: the BCDs' accuracy increased from 37% to 60%, and the PCPs' accuracy increased from 17% to 47%. Alternatively, if we replaced participants' third differential diagnosis with the DLS suggestions that participants include in their differential diagnoses, we found that the BCDs' top-3 accuracy was 59% and the PCPs' top-3 accuracy was 46%. For simplicity and conciseness, throughout this Article we report top-4 accuracy when including DLS suggestions rather than top-3 accuracy with replacement of the third differential diagnosis. Figure 5 shows physicians' top-1 accuracy (Fig. 5a) and top-3 and top-4 accuracies (Fig. 5b) before and after they see the DLS-based suggestions.

Fig. 5
Diagnostic accuracy of physicians with and without DLS assistance.

a, Top-1 accuracy of physicians before and after seeing either the control or treatment DLS suggestion. b, Top-3 and top-4 accuracies of physicians before and after seeing the control or treatment DLS suggestion (BCD: N = 296 physicians and 2,079 observations; PCP: N = 350 physicians and 2,496 observations). Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of the true mean.

When we restricted our analysis to the 236 images on which the control and treatment DLSs make the same predictions, we found that the BCDs and PCPs update their differential in 40% and 54% of diagnoses with the control DLS and in 47% and 61% of diagnoses with the treatment DLS, and these differences are significant at the P = 0.009 and P = 0.001 levels, respectively.

### Characteristics of disease-specific and generic diagnostic pitfalls: a qualitative study [^113VVqFv]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Coding using the RDC taxonomy (Figure 2 B) revealed that 59% of 1041 errors were associated with testing challenges (n = 314) and challenging disease presentation (n = 305). The most frequent RDC subcategories assigned were test follow-up issues (n = 131), challenges in recognition of acuity or severity of illness (n = 82), test performance or interpretation (n = 69), masking or mimicking diagnosis (n = 64), and failure to diagnose the underlying cause (n = 62).

Most specialists were able to offer a number of specific examples of diagnosis failures that they considered to represent recurring pitfalls. These examples generally clustered into (1) more serious specialty diagnoses that were missed or delayed as a result of misdiagnosis upstream by the primary care physician; (2) instances of misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis in which patients were labeled as having a specialty diagnosis (eg, multiple sclerosis) that did not meet diagnostic criteria and/or where an alternate diagnosis (usually more benign, nonspecific, or psychiatric in nature) was more likely; and (3) generic pitfalls in clinical examination or testing relevant to that specialty (see eTable 3 in the Supplement for diagnostic pitfalls associated with neurologic conditions).

### Evaluation of symptom checkers for self diagnosis and triage: audit study [^115F2gDB]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

†Symptom checker does not provide triage advice.

‡Symptom checker does not provide diagnosis suggestions.

Across all symptom checkers the correct diagnosis was listed in the first three diagnoses in 51% (95% confidence interval 47% to 54%) of standardized patient evaluations and in the first 20 diagnoses in 58% (55% to 62%) of standardized patient evaluations (table 2). Diagnostic accuracy for listing the correct diagnosis in the top three and top 20 was higher for self care conditions than for emergent conditions and was also higher for common conditions than for uncommon conditions. There was no significant difference in listing the correct diagnosis in the top 20 between symptom checkers that listed more than 11 diagnoses compared with those that only listed 1–3 diagnoses (59%, 53% to 65% v 53%, 46% to 59%, P = 0.12; table 3). The accuracy of listing the correct diagnosis in the top 20 across the 23 individual symptom checkers ranged from 34% (95% confidence interval 17% to 52%) to 84% (73% to 95%, table 4).

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^115MX39W]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^112rN9eN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Sertraline [^112e6UL8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.

The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride was studied in the risk reduction of OCD relapse. In Study OCD-4, patients ranging in age from 18 to79 meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n = 224) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for analysis of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the Y-BOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Insufficient clinical response during the double-blind phase indicated a worsening of the patient's condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and condition 3 being met at visit 3):

Condition 1: Y-BOCS score increased by ≥ 5 points, to a minimum of 20, relative to baseline;
Condition 2: CGI-I increased by ≥ one point; and
Condition 3: Worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment, to justify alternative treatment.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^111Xi4fX]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

To date, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, particularly protein 14–3–3 testing, presents an important approach in the identification of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases. However, one special point of criticism of 14–3–3 testing is the specificity in the differential diagnosis of rapid dementia. The constant observation of increased cerebrospinal fluid referrals in the national surveillance centres over the last years raises the concern of declining specificity due to higher number of cerebrospinal fluid tests performed in various neurological conditions. Within the framework of a European Community supported longitudinal multicentre study ('cerebrospinal fluid markers') we analysed the spectrum of rapid progressive dementia diagnoses, their potential influence on 14–3–3 specificity as well as results of other dementia markers (tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β(1–42)) and evaluated the specificity of 14–3–3 in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis for the years 1998–2008. A total of 29 022 cerebrospinal fluid samples were analysed for 14–3–3 protein and other cerebrospinal fluid dementia markers in patients with rapid dementia and suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the participating centres. In 10 731 patients a definite diagnosis could be obtained. Protein 14–3–3 specificity was analysed for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with respect to increasing cerebrospinal fluid tests per year and spectrum of differential diagnosis. Ring trials were performed to ensure the comparability between centres during the reported time period. Protein 14–3–3 test specificity remained high and stable in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease during the observed time period across centres (total specificity 92%; when compared with patients with definite diagnoses only: specificity 90%). However, test specificity varied with respect to differential diagnosis. A high 14–3–3 specificity was obtained in differentiation to other neurodegenerative diseases (95–97%) and non-neurological conditions (91–97%). We observed lower specificity in the differential diagnoses of acute neurological diseases (82–87%). A marked and constant increase in cerebrospinal fluid test referrals per year in all centres did not influence 14–3–3 test specificity and no change in spectrum of differential diagnosis was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid protein 14–3–3 detection remains an important test in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Due to a loss in specificity in acute neurological events, the interpretation of positive 14–3–3 results needs to be performed in the clinical context. The spectrum of differential diagnosis of rapid progressive dementia varied from neurodegenerative dementias to dementia due to acute neurological conditions such as inflammatory diseases and non-neurological origin.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: uncommon but critical diagnoses made at the point of care [^111iAzXA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in acute care require rapid, critical decision making, often with limited clinical information. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) can aid in diagnosis by providing information that may not be evident from a patient's medical history, physical examination, and ancillary tests. Eight cases are presented in which FOCUS drastically altered the management of patient care, shortened the differential diagnosis, or allowed for the development of a definitive diagnosis. In 3 cases, diagnoses that were not initially suspected were identified by FOCUS. In the remaining cases, uncommon yet critical diagnoses were established at early stages along the patients' courses of care.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: a systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence and experience based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

Summary

The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

Key Message

This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Preliminary analysis of the impact of lab results on large language model generated differential diagnoses [^11493YbV]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the success of LLM-based DDx from general case reports corpus, researchers applied this approach to various specialized domains, such as rheumatology, neurodegenerative disorders, autoinflammatory disorders, and pediatric critical care. Krusche et al. compared the performance of GPT-4 in diagnosing rheumatologic conditions to that of rheumatologists, reporting comparable accuracy with the correct diagnosis as the top diagnosis in 35% versus 39% of cases, and among the top 3 diagnoses in 60% versus 55% of cases. Koga et al. evaluated ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Google Bard (now called Gemini) in predicting neuropathologic diagnoses from 25 clinical summaries. The models correctly made primary diagnoses in 32%, 52%, and 40% of cases, respectively, and included the correct diagnoses among the differential diagnosis in 76%, 84%, and 76% of cases, respectively. Pillai and Pillai assessed the diagnostic accuracy of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama for autoinflammatory disorders, specifically focusing on Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), using 40 clinical vignettes. They reported that all three models had higher accuracy in identifying FMF compared to DIRA, with GPT-4 correctly identifying 65% of FMF patients versus 90% by clinicians, and 30% of DIRA patients versus 60% by clinicians. Interestingly, they reported that Llama 2 had 0% accuracy in identifying DIRA patients. Apart from using a small number of clinical cases, Akhondi et al. used two general language models (BioGPT-Large and LLaMa-65B) and two fine-tuned models (fine-tuned BioGPT-Large and fine-tuned LLaMa-7B) for differential diagnosis in a pediatric critical care setting. The models were generated using 1,916,538 clinical notes from 32,454 unique patients, evaluated the models using mixed methods regression finding that the differential diagnoses generated by clinicians and the fine-tuned LLaMa-7B were ranked highest in quality in 144 (55%) and 74 (29%) cases, respectively. Hirosawa et al. evaluated the accuracy of differential diagnosis lists generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using 53 case reports from a general internal medicine (GIM) department. The study found that GPT-4 achieved 83% accuracy in the top 10 predictions, 81% in the top 5, and 60% in the top 1 diagnosis. GPT-4's performance was comparable to that of physicians, with accuracy rates of 83% vs. 75% for the top 10, 81% vs. 67% for the top 5, and 60% vs. 50% for the top diagnosis. Additionally, the study reported no significant difference in diagnosis accuracy based on the open access status or the publication date (before 2011 vs. 2022). Wilhelm et al. evaluated Claude-instant-v1.0, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Command-xlarge-nightly, and Bloomz for therapeutic recommendations across 60 diseases in ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dermatology. Using mDISCERN, correctness, and harmfulness metrics (validated by GPT-4 evaluations), they found that Claude-instant-v1.0 achieved the highest mean mDISCERN score (3.35), while Bloomz scored the lowest (1.07). GPT-3.5-Turbo was deemed the safest, though all models lacked discussions on treatment risks and therapy impacts. GPT-4's assessments strongly aligned with those of physicians (P < 0.01). Similarly, another multimodal study by Kaczmarczyk et al. assessed models such as Claude 3 and GPT-4 Vision Preview, among others, on NEJM Image Challenge questions. Claude 3 achieved the highest accuracy (58.8–59.8%), outperforming the average human vote (49.4%, p < 0.001), while GPT-4 Vision Preview favored small images and long questions but fell short compared to collective human decision-making, which reached 90.8% accuracy. Likewise, a multilingual study by Roos et al. tested GPT models on 452 English and 637 German medical questions, analyzing performance by language and difficulty. GPT-4 excelled with up to 95.4% accuracy for English approximate matches, showing cross-linguistic consistency. However, higher question difficulty reduced accuracy, particularly in German datasets, underscoring the need for further validation before clinical adoption.

### Developing and updating differential diagnosis tables in emergency medicine for potentially life-threatening diseases [^11374uWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

No study has verified whether the published differential diagnosis tables cover all potentially life-threatening diseases observed in real-world clinical practice and updated the tables using real-world data.

Objectives

To create initial differential diagnosis tables based on published resources, and to validate and update the tables using the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) database as a real-world reference METHODS: We created the initial differential diagnosis tables using published textbooks, UpToDate®, BMJ Best Practice, and databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases) without language restrictions from their inception to September 22, 2022. Then, we extracted chief complaints and diagnosis lists from the NHAMCS database of emergency patients aged ≥ 16 years between November 2016 and 2019. Finally, we compared the diagnosis lists from the NAMCS database and the initial tables to cover all potentially life-threatening diseases.

Results

We created the initial tables for 78 chief complaints and 2054 differential diagnoses (554 and 1500 in the red and yellow categories, respectively). Additionally, we created 71 chief complaints and 1,468 differential diagnoses from the NHAMCS database. We found 114 potentially life-threatening diseases associated with 39 chief complaints not covered by the initial tables. Finally, the initial tables were updated to include 78 chief complaints and 2168 differential diagnoses.

Conclusions

The updated differential diagnosis tables will help prevent missed diagnoses of potentially life-threatening diseases, improve patient outcomes, and facilitate clinical research.

### A 59-year-old man with fatigue and abdominal pain [^115oXmPa]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man with a history of nephrolithiasis and gastroesophageal reflux who sought evaluation for fatigue and abdominal pain. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is iteratively refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Evaluation of a computer-based facial dysmorphology analysis algorithm (face2Gene) using standardized textbook photos [^111bWkMc]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Genetic syndromes often have ocular involvement. Ophthalmologists may have difficulty identifying dysmorphic features in genetic syndrome evaluations. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of Face2Gene (F2G), a digital image analysis software trained on integrating dysmorphic features, by analysing patient photos from genetics textbooks.

Methods

We analysed all clear facial photos contained within the textbooks Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation and Genetic Diseases of the Eye using F2G under standard lighting conditions. Variables captured include colour versus grey scale photo, the gender of the patient (if known), age of the patient (if known), disease categories, diagnosis as listed in the textbook, and whether the disease has ophthalmic involvement (as described in the textbook entries). Any photos rejected by F2G were excluded. We analysed the data for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on disease categories as outlined in Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Malformation.

Results

We analysed 353 photos found within two textbooks. The exact book diagnosis was identified by F2G in 150 (42.5%) entries, and was included in the top three differential diagnoses in 191 (54.1%) entries. F2G is highly sensitive for craniosynostosis syndromes (point estimate [PE] 80.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 56.3–94.3%, P = 0.0118) and syndromes with facial defects as a major feature (PE 77.8%, 95% CI 52.4–93.6%, P = 0.0309). F2G was highly specific (PE > 83percentage with P < 0.001) for all disease categories.

Conclusions

F2G is a useful tool for paediatric ophthalmologists to help build a differential diagnosis when evaluating children with dysmorphic facial features.

What is new in the assessment of severity?

The original Ranson criteria from 1974, last modified in 2012, have been followed by several new and in part much more complex scoring systems; however, these have only increased diagnostic performance modestly (AUC from 0.57 to 0.74). Recent findings suggest that the presence of under- or overweight, development or persistence of organ failure, and assessment of biomarkers, such as cytokine levels might help to further improve identification of high-risk patients (Fig. 1).

### Improving the accuracy of medical diagnosis with causal machine learning [^1137dAtL]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Providing accurate and accessible diagnoses is a fundamental challenge for global healthcare systems. In the US alone an estimated 5% of outpatients receive the wrong diagnosis every year. These errors are particularly common when diagnosing patients with serious medical conditions, with an estimated 20% of these patients being misdiagnosed at the level of primary careand one in three of these misdiagnoses resulting in serious patient harm.

In recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems in diverse domains –. In particular, machine learning assisted diagnosis promises to revolutionise healthcare by leveraging abundant patient data to provide precise and personalised diagnoses –. Despite significant research efforts and renewed commercial interest, diagnostic algorithms have struggled to achieve the accuracy of doctors in differential diagnosis –, where there are multiple possible causes of a patients symptoms.

This raises the question, why do existing approaches struggle with differential diagnosis? All existing diagnostic algorithms, including Bayesian model-based and Deep Learning approaches, rely on associative inference — they identify diseases based on how correlated they are with a patients symptoms and medical history. This is in contrast to how doctors perform diagnosis, selecting the diseases which offer the best causal explanations for the patients symptoms. As noted by Pearl, associative inference is the simplest in a hierarchy of possible inference schemes –. Counterfactual inference sits at the top of this hierarchy, and allows one to ascribe causal explanations to data. Here, we argue that diagnosis is fundamentally a counterfactual inference task. We show that failure to disentangle correlation from causation places strong constraints on the accuracy of associative diagnostic algorithms, sometimes resulting in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To resolve this, we present a causal definition of diagnosis that is closer to the decision making of clinicians, and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms to validate this approach.

### Accuracy of large language models in generating differential diagnosis from clinical presentation and imaging findings in pediatric cases [^111xfooc]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Large language models (LLM) have shown promise in assisting medical decision-making. However, there is limited literature exploring the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in generating differential diagnoses from text-based image descriptions and clinical presentations in pediatric radiology.

Objective

To examine the performance of multiple proprietary LLMs in producing accurate differential diagnoses for text-based pediatric radiological cases without imaging.

Materials and Methods

One hundred sixty-four cases were retrospectively selected from a pediatric radiology textbook and converted into two formats: (1) image description only, and (2) image description with clinical presentation. The ChatGPT-4 V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro algorithms were given these inputs and tasked with providing a top 1 diagnosis and a top 3 differential diagnoses. Accuracy of responses was assessed by comparison with the original literature. Top 1 accuracy was defined as whether the top 1 diagnosis matched the textbook, and top 3 differential accuracy was defined as the number of diagnoses in the model-generated top 3 differential that matched any of the top 3 diagnoses in the textbook. McNemar's test, Cochran's Q test, Friedman test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare algorithms and assess the impact of added clinical information, respectively.

Results

There was no significant difference in top 1 accuracy between ChatGPT-4 V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro when only image descriptions were provided (56.1% [95% CI 48.4–63.5], 64.6% [95% CI 57.1–71.5], 61.6% [95% CI 54.0–68.7]; P = 0.11). Adding clinical presentation to image description significantly improved top 1 accuracy for ChatGPT-4 V (64.0% [95% CI 56.4–71.0], P = 0.02) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (80.5% [95% CI 73.8–85.8], P < 0.001). For image description and clinical presentation cases, Claude 3.5 Sonnet significantly outperformed both ChatGPT-4 V and Gemini 1.5 Pro (P < 0.001). For top 3 differential accuracy, no significant differences were observed between ChatGPT-4 V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, regardless of whether the cases included only image descriptions (1.29 [95% CI 1.16–1.41], 1.35 [95% CI 1.23–1.48], 1.37 [95% CI 1.25–1.49]; P = 0.60) or both image descriptions and clinical presentations (1.33 [95% CI 1.20–1.45], 1.52 [95% CI 1.41–1.64], 1.48 [95% 1.36–1.59]; P = 0.72). Only Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed significantly better when clinical presentation was added (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Commercial LLMs performed similarly on pediatric radiology cases in providing top 1 accuracy and top 3 differential accuracy when only a text-based image description was used. Adding clinical presentation significantly improved top 1 accuracy for ChatGPT-4 V and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with Claude showing the largest improvement. Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed both ChatGPT-4 V and Gemini 1.5 Pro in top 1 accuracy when both image and clinical data were provided. No significant differences were found in top 3 differential accuracy across models in any condition.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — future directions and conclusions — There are major gaps in understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CVS, which limits the development of more effective treatments. Similarly, an incomplete understanding of the clinical features and comorbidities that predict clinical responses is a barrier to developing personalized therapeutic approaches. Clinical research leveraging multicenter, standardized registries of patients with CVS and directed investments by both industry and governmental sources are needed. CVS is a common and disabling condition in adults, but need not be so, as it is a treatable condition, and prompt recognition remains the key factor in avoiding unnecessary investigations and providing patients with effective treatments.

### Diagnostic reasoning in challenging cases [^111XnzX9]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning relies on cognitive heuristics to recognise patterns of symptoms and signs in order to arrive at a diagnosis. These rules of thumb allow us to rapidly diagnose common conditions that present in typical ways. However, they may lead us astray when common conditions present atypically or when a patient has a rare condition or multiple conditions causing their constellation of symptoms, signs, and test results, rather than having a single diagnosis to explain them all. This article describes strategies to help counteract diagnostic pitfalls, to expand diagnostic possibilities and to make diagnostic progress with complex, multielement cases.

### Comparative accuracy of diagnosis by collective intelligence of multiple physicians vs individual physicians [^111zbkD4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Collective Intelligence Rule: Proportional Weighting

To create a differential diagnosis informed by the collective contributions of multiple Human Dx users, we generated a collective differential with a set of rules. In the base case used as the default for most of the analyses, we used a 1/n weighting rule. For an individual solver with n diagnoses in his or her differential diagnoses, we weighted each diagnosis by its order in the differential (ie, the nᵗʰ diagnosis would be weighted 1/n) to downweight diagnoses with lower ranks in long lists. For each group of users ranging from 2 to 9 members, the weights of each diagnosis among solvers were summed to produce a ranked list of diagnoses: the collective differential. In the base case, we used the top 3 diagnoses in this collective differential to adjudicate the differential as correct if the intended diagnosis or differential diagnosis was included in the top 3 collective differential diagnoses.

We tested the performance of our collective differential approach using a range of variations on the base case rules above across 3 dimensions: the weighting rule for creating collective differentials, the number of diagnoses in the collective differential used to adjudicate success, and the number of user diagnoses used to create a collective differential. For the weighting rule, we looked at 3 other approaches: 1/n² (which heavily downweights diagnoses beyond the first 2), equal weights for all diagnoses (which does not downweight lower-ranked diagnoses), or equal weights with a randomly ordered 5 diagnoses for each user (which ignores ranking). For the number of diagnoses in the collective differential, we looked at performance using the top 1 through 5 diagnoses. For user diagnoses, we used the top 5 user diagnoses with the 1/n weighting rule to create a collective differential. The base case uses the top 3 diagnoses for both the collective differential and user diagnoses.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117HXpB9]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — for patients with suspected HP, we suggest using a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) for diagnostic decision-making (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence), with voting results: definitely agree, 12; probably agree, 0; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 2; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 1. If a high confidence diagnosis cannot be established by combining the history and clinical context, consider case discussion in the setting of an MDD. Observational data show diagnostic impact: in the largest retrospective cohort of 938 suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) referrals, 34/938 (4%) had a referral HP diagnosis and only 16/34 (47%) were confirmed after MDD, while 61 additional non-HP referrals received a post-MDD HP diagnosis; in a separate 90-patient series, 3/90 (3%) had a referral HP diagnosis and 14/90 [16%] were diagnosed with HP after MDD. In an observational single-center multidisciplinary team meeting of 150 cases, MDD led to a significant increase in HP diagnoses from 11 to 20 cases, with the additional nine previously classified as unclassifiable ILD. When histopathology from surgical lung biopsy (SLB) alone did not suggest HP, interdisciplinary evaluation yielded new diagnoses: among 88 SLB patients, HP was diagnosed in 3/88 (3%) based on combined clinical-histologic features and in another 10/88 (11%) following interdisciplinary case evaluation, and in a separate SLB series of 71 patients, 8/71 (11%) received an MDD HP diagnosis while pathologists' reports were nonspecific in 3/8 (38%) and included HP in the differential for 4/8 (50%). Between-team agreement was limited, with inter-MDTM agreement on confident diagnoses (K = 0.24) and on diagnostic likelihood (weighted K = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24–0.40). Longitudinal reassessment can change diagnoses: after step-wise clinical-radiological review 40/93 (43%) cases were deemed HP (11/40, 27% with high probability), and in a single-center series of 56 ILD patients over an average of 7 months, reevaluation altered the original HP diagnosis in 7/22 (32%) and increased pulmonologist–radiologist agreement (K from 0.17 to 0.44).

### A randomized controlled trial of online symptom searching to inform patient generated differential diagnoses [^115GVQcu]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patient online health searching is now commonplace, however, the accuracy of patient generated differentials for new symptoms and potential for patient anxiety are concerns. We aimed primarily to determine the accuracy of patient generated differentials for new symptoms with and without online searching, and secondarily, to evaluate the impact of searching on anxiety levels. In the waiting room prior to seeing a clinician, 300 patients with new symptoms were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to Google searching with health related features including a symptom search tool vs Google searching with health related features disabled vs no searching. Participants were 18 years or older and presenting to the emergency department of an urban academic medical center with new low-acuity symptoms that were not due to exacerbation of a chronic condition. Search groups received access on a tablet/smartphone to Google searching with or without health related features. Both search groups could access any websites; health related features led the patient to common diagnoses and physician-validated information. The primary outcome was accuracy of the patient generated differential assessed by matching at least two of the top three diagnoses on the clinician's differential. A secondary outcome was anxiety by a visual analogue scale. Patients were a median of 33.1 (IQI 26.2–45.9) years old, 60% women, 63% black, 82% had a high school education or less, and 45.7% reported having performed an online search prior to presentation. Search group patients spent a median of 3.82 (2.53–5.72) minutes searching online. Similar proportions of patients in each group matched at least two of three clinician diagnoses: 27.0% and 28.3% for Google searching with and without health related features vs 23.8% in the no search group. Patients in the search groups had a similar odds of matching ≥ 2/3 diagnoses as the no search group [OR (95% CI): 1.23 (0.70–2.13), p = 0.47]. Anxiety was unchanged with online searching. In conclusion, brief online searching in the waiting room did not improve accuracy of patient generated differential diagnoses for new symptoms. The absence of an increase in patient anxiety provides reassurance for subsequent work to refine and investigate online symptom search tools.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^117QvY3a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of the s-EVS — In adult ED patients with s-EVS, the writing committee believes that routine use of a detailed history and physical examination with emphasis on cranial nerves including visual fields, eye movements, limb coordination, and gait assessment helps to distinguish between central (TIA) and peripheral (vestibular migraine, Menière disease) diagnoses [ungraded good practice statement]. In adult ED patients with s-EVS, we recommend against routine use of CT to help distinguish between central (TIA) and peripheral (vestibular migraine, Menière disease) diagnoses (strong recommendation, AGAINST). In adult ED patients with s-EVS and concern for TIA, we suggest use of CTA or MRA of the head and neck to rule out posterior circulation vascular pathology (conditional recommendation, FOR).

### A 36-year-old man with persistent headache [^1177V5Ef]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^116BZS2q]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) examination — The goals of a POAG examination should be to make a differential diagnosis, establish a disease baseline, estimate the risk of future glaucomatous damage, decide whether, by what method, and/or how aggressively to initially treat, and determine the timing of future monitoring examinations. In addition to testing in a comprehensive eye and vision examination, a POAG confirmatory examination should include expanded investigations in patient history; clinicians should obtain an in-depth family history that is continually updated during follow-up visits (Evidence Grade: D), including systemic or ophthalmic surgeries (including refractive surgeries which can affect refractive error, central corneal thickness and IOP readings) and traumas; personal and/or familial history of glaucoma and eye drop use, including which relatives (especially mothers and siblings) and level of severity; systemic history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, migraine, vasospasm and DM; all medications both prescribed and over the counter; and allergies and previous reactions to medication.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department that leads to a great deal of resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is long and most cases are caused by benign pathology that will resolve on its own. Imaging is over-used and rarely helps. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination that will help physicians better identify the small of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, will result in significant neurological damage.

### Acute pancreatitis [^111hE7nJ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Acute pancreatitis, an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, is the leading cause of admission to hospital for gastrointestinal disorders in the USA and many other countries. Gallstones and alcohol misuse are long-established risk factors, but several new causes have emerged that, together with new aspects of pathophysiology, improve understanding of the disorder. As incidence (and admission rates) of acute pancreatitis increase, so does the demand for effective management. We review how to manage patients with acute pancreatitis, paying attention to diagnosis, differential diagnosis, complications, prognostic factors, treatment, and prevention of second attacks, and the possible transition from acute to chronic pancreatitis.

### Applications of machine learning in meniere's disease assessment based on pure-tone audiometry [^112dWy13]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous research in another patient cohort has reported that low‐frequency hearing loss is significant in the diagnosis of MD. In our feature weight analysis, we found that the top 3 features influencing the model's diagnosis of MD are the standard deviation of overall frequencies, the mean of low frequencies, and the mean of overall frequencies. For identifying EH, the most critical features are the mean of low frequencies, the peak of the audiogram, and the standard deviation of the entire frequency range. Overall, our analysis suggests that pure‐tone audiometry features hold significant potential for distinguishing MD and diagnosing EH.

Our study demonstrates that the machine learning model is highly effective in determining the sidedness of MD and differentiating it from VM. However, it is important to note that while this model is useful for differentiation, it should not be used for the de novo diagnosis of MD. The definitive diagnosis of MD still requires clinical determinations based on a comprehensive assessment of vestibular symptoms. Additionally, expanding the dataset and refining the model could further enhance its accuracy and applicability. In future studies, we should include patients with other conditions that require differential diagnosis from MD to train the model, thereby improving its practicality and effectiveness.

### Evaluation of a large language model's ability to assist in an orthopedic hand clinic [^112QGAAa]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Advancements in artificial intelligence technology, such as OpenAI's large language model, ChatGPT, could transform medicine through applications in a clinical setting. This study aimed to assess the utility of ChatGPT as a clinical assistant in an orthopedic hand clinic.

Methods

Nine clinical vignettes, describing various common and uncommon hand pathologies, were constructed and reviewed by 4 fellowship-trained orthopedic hand surgeons and an orthopedic resident. ChatGPT was given these vignettes and asked to generate a differential diagnosis, potential workup plan, and provide treatment options for its top differential. Responses were graded for accuracy and the overall utility scored on a 5-point Likert scale.

Results

The diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT was 7 out of 9 cases, indicating an overall accuracy rate of 78%. ChatGPT was less reliable with more complex pathologies and failed to identify an intentionally incorrect presentation. ChatGPT received a score of 3.8 ± 1.4 for correct diagnosis, 3.4 ± 1.4 for helpfulness in guiding patient management, 4.1 ± 1.0 for appropriate workup for the actual diagnosis, 4.3 ± 0.8 for an appropriate recommended treatment plan for the diagnosis, and 4.4 ± 0.8 for the helpfulness of treatment options in managing patients.

Conclusion

ChatGPT was successful in diagnosing most of the conditions; however, the overall utility of its advice was variable. While it performed well in recommending treatments, it faced difficulties in providing appropriate diagnoses for uncommon pathologies. In addition, it failed to identify an obvious error in presenting pathology.

### A method for inferring medical diagnoses from patient similarities [^111Wcbb9]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Prediction precision for recent hospitalizations. The prediction precision for primary discharge codes (black) and all discharge codes (blue) for the USA data (circles) and the ISR data (crosses) as a function of the number of top ranked predictions per patient. Precision is measured for ICD level 1 (A), level 2 (B) and level 3 (C). ICD, International Classification of Diseases; ISR, Israel; USA, United States.

As a physician can likely also benefit from a more coarse classification, we checked the precision in predicting the second and first level of the ICD (Figures 3 B and 3 C, respectively). The top prediction was accurate for 47% (41%) of the patients when considering second level ICD codes and 70% (66%) when considering the first level codes (including also non-primary codes). Similarly, 93% (95%) of the patients had the correct second level ICD code in their top ten predictions (and 99% (98%) the correct first level code). Manually examining the hospitalizations for which we failed to predict the correct second level of the ICD (spanning 7% (5%) of the patients), we found that several of our predictions, while not an exact match, had a known association to the correct diagnoses. For example, a patient with acute bronchitis was predicted to have chronic bronchitis (noting that this patient had no such chronic condition mentioned in his medical history). Other examples include prediction of heart failure for two (ISR) patients (a man and a woman) diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, and the latter often supersedes the former and prediction of episodic mood disorders for a (USA) patient with depressive disorder.

### Association of insurance mix and diagnostic coding practices in New York state hospitals [^111ccFaF]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Given higher reimbursement rates, hospitals primarily serving privately insured patients may invest more in intensive coding than hospitals serving publicly insured patients. This may lead these hospitals to code more diagnoses for all patients.

Objective

To estimate whether, for the same Medicaid enrollee with multiple hospitalizations, a hospital's share of privately insured patients is associated with the number of diagnoses on claims.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used patient-level fixed effects regression models on inpatient Medicaid claims from Medicaid enrollees with at least 2 admissions in at least 2 different hospitals in New York State between 2010 and 2017. Analyses were conducted from 2019 to 2021.

Exposures

The annual share of privately insured patients at the admitting hospital.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of diagnostic codes per admission. Probability of diagnoses being from a list of conditions shown to be intensely coded in response to payment incentives.

Results

This analysis included 1 614 630 hospitalizations for Medicaid-insured patients (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [20.1] years; 829 684 [51.4%] women and 784 946 [48.6%] men). Overall, 74 998 were Asian (4.6%), 462 259 Black (28.6%), 375 591 Hispanic (23.3%), 486 313 White (30.1%), 128 896 unknown (8.0%), and 86 573 other (5.4%). When the same patient was seen in a hospital with a higher share of privately insured patients, more diagnoses were recorded (0.03 diagnoses per percentage point [pp] increase in share of privately insured; 95% CI, 0.02–0.05; P < .001). Patients discharged from hospitals in the bottom quartile of privately insured patient share received 1.37 more diagnoses when they were subsequently discharged from hospitals in the top quartile, relative to patients whose admissions were both in the bottom quartile (95% CI, 1.21–1.53; P < .001). Those going from hospitals in the top quartile to the bottom had 1.67 fewer diagnoses (95% CI, -1.84 to -1.50; P < .001). Diagnoses in hospitals with a higher private payer share were more likely to be for conditions sensitive to payment incentives (0.08 pp increase for each pp increase in private share; 95% CI, 0.06–0.10; P < .001). These findings were replicated in 2016 to 2017 data.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of Medicaid enrollees, admission to a hospital with a higher private payer share was associated with more diagnoses on Medicaid claims. This suggests payment policy may drive differential investments in infrastructure to document diagnoses. This may create a feedback loop that exacerbates resource inequity.

### OARSI initiative to develop classification criteria for early-stage symptomatic knee OA (EsSKOA): what conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of EsSKOA? [^115WJ3Sg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Classification criteria for early-stage symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (EsSKOA) should discriminate individuals with EsSKOA from those with other causes of knee symptoms. We sought to identify conditions in the differential diagnosis of EsSKOA in adults with knee symptoms.

Design

We conducted an online survey of clinicians. Those consulting monthly on at least five people with undiagnosed knee symptoms were eligible. From qualitative work and clinical experience, we developed three case scenarios representing possible EsSKOA: 1. 40-year-old with 1 month of knee stiffness and swelling; 2. 50-year-old with 8 months of knee discomfort while walking; and 3. 60-year-old with intense knee discomfort getting out of a car 1 week ago. For each scenario, participants indicated conditions on a pre-defined list that they would consider in the differential diagnosis, and the top three diagnoses based on clinical experience. The proportions that considered each condition and among the top three diagnoses for each scenario were summarized overall and by clinical discipline.

Results

127 clinicians responded (43% female, 48% in practice ≤ 15 years, 50% university-affiliated practice, 7 clinical disciplines). Knee OA and meniscal injuries were among the top three conditions in the differential diagnosis for all three scenarios, followed by immune-mediated and crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis (scenario 1), patellofemoral pain syndrome (scenario 2), and collateral ligament injuries (scenario 3).

Conclusion

The differential diagnosis for EsSKOA in adults presenting with undiagnosed knee symptoms includes symptomatic established radiographic knee OA, patellofemoral pain syndrome, meniscal and collateral ligament injuries, and immune-mediated and crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis.

### Preliminary analysis of the impact of lab results on large language model generated differential diagnoses [^113z35yd]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We assessed the impact of laboratory test results on enhancing the accuracy of differential diagnosis using five large language models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama2–70B, Claude-2, and Mixtral 8x7B-Chat. Clinical case reports were sourced from the PMC-Patients dataset for this evaluation. The term "differential diagnosis" refers to a list of potential conditions or diseases that may be causing a patient's symptoms and signs. Clinicians consider the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and investigation results, collectively known as clinical vignettes, to aid in the diagnostic process. For this study, clinical vignettes were manually generated from 50 selected case reports, including details such as the patient's age, gender, symptoms, laboratory test results, and other relevant information, to enable the language models to formulate differential diagnostic responses. Initially, clinical reports including laboratory test results and age-specific cases, were selected to generate clinical vignettes. These vignettes were manually extracted from the clinical case presentation sections, encompassing details such as age, sex, symptoms, full case report, and lab tests. A differential diagnosis (DDx) prompt was then created, instructing the large language models to consider all pertinent details and formulate comprehensive and accurate differential diagnoses. These predictions were categorized into top 10, top 5, and top 1 differential diagnoses. The accuracy of the model's predictions was evaluated using metrics such as exact match, relevance, and incorrect predictions, with accuracy further divided into exact and lenient categories.

Ethical considerations

Since this study employed case vignettes derived from publicly available published case reports, approval from the ethics committee and the requirement for individual consent were not necessary.

### Expanding the differential for alternative diagnoses in the workup of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^113ckNW1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children are increasingly admitted for MIS-C evaluation, but instead found to have alternative diagnoses.

Methods

Retrospective study of all pediatric patients < 21 years of age hospitalized between August 1, 2020, and July 31, 2021, with clinical concern for MIS-C at the time of presentation were identified through use of an institutional computerized MIS-C order entry set. Final diagnoses were then collected through primary review of the medical record from the time of initial presentation through 1-month postdischarge.

Results

Of 359 cases identified through the MIS-C order entry set, 126 (35.1%) met criteria for MIS-C, 28 had Kawasaki Disease (KD) (7.8%), and 11 cases met criteria for both MIS-C and KD (3.1%), leaving 194 (54.0%) patients ruled out and categorized as "MIS-C mimickers". Infectious diagnoses were the most common MIS-C mimickers (78.9%). Of the infectious etiologies, bacterial (51.0%) and viral (52.3%) etiologies were seen with similar frequency.

Conclusions

We describe MIS-C mimickers spanning multiple subspecialties, with infectious etiologies predominating, which can aid clinicians in the consideration of diagnostic testing, with the goal of achieving timely and accurate diagnoses.

### A randomized controlled trial of online symptom searching to inform patient generated differential diagnoses [^116wzTER]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Interventions

The first search group received access on a tablet/smartphone to Google searching with health related features including a symptom search tool that leads users to knowledge cards (Google Search). These knowledge cards deliver medical information such as typical symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and medical illustrations. The information has been compiled, curated, and reviewed for accuracy by physicians from leading institutions and is ranked by the probability of a health condition. Screenshot examples of the mobile Google search with health related features are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. The second search group received access on a tablet/smartphone to Google Search with health related features disabled (HFD). The search groups were instructed to perform the search to inform what diagnoses they thought were most likely causing their symptoms and to consider questions that they may want to ask their clinician. Each search group was allotted a maximum of 15 min for search time before seeing the clinician. However, the investigators anticipated that the typical patient would search for < 5 min and judged that as a meaningful amount of time to review information and form a differential.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was accuracy of the patient generated differential diagnosis assessed by matching ≥ 2/3 diagnoses with the clinician differential. The clinician differential was generated immediately post history and physical examination. The denominator was fixed at 3 as the patient and the clinician each could list a maximum of three diagnoses. To determine the numerator, three physician reviewers (OF, EM, SM) independently evaluated differential diagnoses and scored them as 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the number of unordered matches made between the patient and clinician diagnoses. Therefore, 2/3 agreement meant that the patient and clinician listed 2 of 3 diagnoses that were the same, regardless of where they were on each list. Disagreements (2%) were resolved through discussion to reach consensus.

A pre-specified secondary outcome was anxiety, scored from 0 (calm) to 30 (anxious) per the visual analogue scale (VAS-A), which is validated for quick repetition. An exploratory secondary outcome was the patient–clinician relationship, assessed by post-visit surveys of patients and clinicians. The surveys assessed on a 0 (worse than usual) to 100 (better than usual) scale overall satisfaction, communication, feeling connected, speed of diagnosis, visit length, and shared decision making. These surveys have not been previously validated or historically collected at our recruitment sites. No changes were made to outcomes after trial commencement.

### A method for inferring medical diagnoses from patient similarities [^1131uogJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prospective validation

Next, we applied our method in a scenario that mimics the admission of new patients. We split the hospitalizations into training and validation subsets, based on admission date when available (Methods). In the following, we report first the USA dataset performance and the ISR performance is provided in parentheses for clarity. As we focus on predicting at least one primary diagnosis per patient, we measure our performance by computing the percentage of patients with at least one correct prediction (that is, precision). While the top predicted discharge code was correct for 18% (17%) of the patients, the top ten predictions contained a correct discharge code for 67% (64%) of the patients. We note that the task here is more challenging than the previous 'cross-validation' one since the latter evaluates a specific set of options for ICD codes (those in the test set) while here we evaluate all possible codes as we have no prior information for a new patient. One reason for the lower precision lies in the fact that discharge diagnosis codes include also 'secondary' discharge codes, ranked lower than the top two discharge codes for a patient. Since the distinction between primary (top discharge codes and physician release codes) and secondary (additional discharge codes) is done manually and is subjective, we also checked the prediction precision relative to the complete set of discharge codes, including both primary codes and secondary codes (the latter not appearing in the training set) to find that our top prediction was correct for 32% of the patients (both datasets) with 84% (89%) of patients with at least one correct hit within the top ten predictions (Figure 3 A). For example, we predicted diabetes mellitus for a patient who indeed had that condition; however it was not marked as the primary diagnosis. For comparison, we tested the precision against 1,000 sets of randomly shuffled associations between diagnoses and patients (maintaining the distribution of the ICDs and the number of diagnoses per patient), verifying that none of the shuffled associations obtained comparable precision (P < 0.001).

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116BXpqN]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnoses

Differential diagnoses for migraine include other primary headache disorders (Table 1) and some secondary headache disorders (Table 2). Distinction from other primary headache disorders is a prerequisite for successful management, whereas distinction from secondary headache disorders is crucial because some of these disorders are serious and potentially life-threatening (for example, meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage) (Table 2).

Table 1
Characteristics of primary headache disorders

Table 2
Red flags associated with secondary headaches,

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the only other paroxysmal headache disorder that is prevalent in the general population. TTH lacks the symptoms that accompany migraine and usually involves bilateral, mild to moderate pain with a pressing or tightening quality that is not aggravated by routine physical activity, (Table 1).

Cluster headache is a much less prevalent primary headache disorder that affects ~0.1% of the general population. Its features are highly characteristic and include frequently recurrent but short-lasting attacks (15–180 min) of strictly unilateral headache of severe or very severe intensity. The head pain is accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation and nasal congestion(Table 1).

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder that is an important differential diagnosis for chronic migraine(Box 1). This disorder commonly develops from overuse of acute medication to treat migraine attacks, so the two disorders are often conflated (see Step 8 for more on MOH).

Some other secondary headache disorders can present with features that suggest migraine, but specific red flags should create suspicion (Table 2). Red flags in the medical history include thunderclap headache, atypical aura and head trauma. Red flags in the physical examination include unexplained fever, impaired memory and focal neurological symptoms (Table 2). These red flags are indications for further investigation, such as neuroimaging, blood samples or lumbar puncture.

### Unique clinical language patterns among expert vestibular providers can predict vestibular diagnoses [^115iFrmw]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify novel language usage by expert providers predictive of specific vestibular conditions.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review and natural language processing. Level IV.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Patients seen for vestibular complaint.

Intervention(S)

Natural language processing and machine learning analyses of semantic and syntactic patterns in clinical documentation from vestibular patients.

Main Outcome Measure

Accuracy of Naïve Bayes predictive models correlating language usage with clinical diagnoses.

Results

Natural language analyses on 866 physician-generated histories from vestibular patients found 3,286 unique examples of language usage of which 614 were used 10 or greater times. The top 15 semantic types represented only 11% of all Unified Medical Language System semantic types but covered 86% of language used in vestibular patient histories. Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms on a subset of 255 notes representing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, anxiety-related dizziness and central dizziness generated strong predictive models showing an average sensitivity rate of 93.4% and a specificity rate of 98.2%. A binary model for assessing whether a subject had a specific diagnosis or not had an average AUC for the receiver operating characteristic curves of .995 across all conditions.

Conclusions

These results indicate that expert providers utilize unique language patterns in vestibular notes that are highly conserved. These patterns have strong predictive power toward specific vestibular diagnoses. Such language elements can provide a simple vocabulary to aid nonexpert providers in formulating a differential diagnosis. They can also be incorporated into clinical decision support systems to facilitate accurate vestibular diagnosis in ambulatory settings.

### Classification and diagnosis of patients with medically unexplained symptoms [^114MBibW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have little or no demonstrable disease explanation for the symptoms, and comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent. Although common, costly, distressed, and often receiving ill-advised testing and treatments, most MUS patients go unrecognized, which precludes effective treatment. To enhance recognition, we present an emerging perspective that envisions a unitary classification for the entire spectrum of MUS where this diagnosis comprises severity, duration, and comorbidity. We then present a specific approach for making the diagnosis at each level of severity. Although our disease-based diagnosis system dictates excluding organic disease to diagnose MUS, much exclusion can occur clinically without recourse to laboratory or consultative evaluation because the majority of patients are mild. Only the less common, "difficult" patients with moderate and severe MUS require investigation to exclude organic diseases. By explicitly diagnosing and labeling all severity levels of MUS, we propose that this diagnostic approach cannot only facilitate effective treatment but also reduce the cost and morbidity from unnecessary interventions.

### Preliminary analysis of the impact of lab results on large language model generated differential diagnoses [^115d46j5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis (DDx) is crucial for medicine as it helps healthcare providers systematically distinguish between conditions that share similar symptoms. This study evaluates the influence of lab test results on DDx accuracy generated by large language models (LLMs). Clinical vignettes from 50 randomly selected case reports from PMC-Patients were created, incorporating demographics, symptoms, and lab data. Five LLMs — GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-2–70b, Claude-2, and Mixtral-8x7B — were tested to generate Top 10, Top 5, and Top 1 DDx with and without lab data. Results show that incorporating lab data enhances accuracy by up to 30% across models. GPT-4 achieved the highest performance, with Top 1 accuracy of 55% (0.41–0.69) and lenient accuracy reaching 79% (0.68–0.90). Statistically significant improvements (Holm-adjusted p values < 0.05) were observed, with GPT-4 and Mixtral excelling. Lab tests, including liver function, metabolic/toxicology panels, and serology, were generally interpreted correctly by LLMs for DDx.

### Deep learning-aided decision support for diagnosis of skin disease across skin tones [^11257MP4]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Figure 2b presents the top-3 accuracies of the BCDs' and PCPs' full differential diagnoses across the eight main diseases and a category labeled 'Other', which aggregates the auxiliary 38 skin diseases into a single category. The BCDs significantly outperformed the PCPs at visually diagnosing skin diseases from images across seven of the eight skin diseases and the Other category. Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 show confusion matrices for how the consensus labels match the leading diagnoses of the BCDs and PCPs, respectively.

We found that the majority of BCDs and PCPs chose to respond with a default confidence of 50%. For participants who did not choose the default confidence, we found that top-1 and top-3 accuracies are positively correlated with confidence for the BCDs and PCPs, with Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.14 and 0.17. In Extended Data Fig. 1, we show participant accuracy by reported confidence.

We found that the most common leading diagnosis for each image by BCDs and PCPs is correct in 48% and 33% of observations, respectively. At least one BCD identified the reference label in their differential diagnosis in 77% of images, and at least one PCP identified the reference label in their differential diagnosis in 58% of images. After seeing a correct DLS prediction, at least one BCD included the reference label in their differential diagnosis in 98% of images.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111BJ4Bz]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3 — t-EVS differential and bedside diagnostic features — The key differential diagnosis in t-EVS is between the relatively rare central paroxysmal positional vertigo and the very common BPPV, and patients are usually asymptomatic at rest in the ED but, by definition, their symptoms can be triggered/reproduced at the bedside with positional testing, so physical examination has the potential to make a confident specific diagnosis. Aggregated evidence supports a strong recommendation for use of the Dix–Hallpike test to diagnose pc-BPPV when the triggered and transient upbeat torsional nystagmus is present, whereas it supports a conditional recommendation for use of MRI in cases with atypical nystagmus or lack of response to canalith repositioning treatments. BPPV can sometimes be mistaken for orthostatic hypotension, but symptoms in BPPV usually also occur on reclining or when rolling over in bed, episodes that occur during sleep strongly suggest BPPV, and patients with orthostatic hypotension rarely have nystagmus on positional testing unless the hypotension is profound.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^111nkKSU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### Guidelines for differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis [^114Axzwb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

This article comments on guidelines published by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS in relation to exclusion of alternative diagnoses when multiple sclerosis (MS) is suspected. The guidelines cover recommendations from three working groups, each with a different remit: identification of 'red flags' for alternative diagnoses to MS; design of diagnostic algorithms for common clinically isolated syndromes; and differentiation of MS from other idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases. The major red flags identified in the study provide a useful list of diseases that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of MS. The definition of clinically isolated syndromes is broadened, and the panel suggests that a stricter definition of encephalopathy should be set for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The guidelines demonstrate the potential complexity of MS diagnosis — especially during the early stages of disease — and give useful guidance, especially for the non-MS neurologist, as to how to approach the diagnosis in a systematic way.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker supported diagnosis of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and rapid dementias: a longitudinal multicentre study over 10 years [^115ZPr1P]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

To date, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, particularly protein 14–3–3 testing, presents an important approach in the identification of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases. However, one special point of criticism of 14–3–3 testing is the specificity in the differential diagnosis of rapid dementia. The constant observation of increased cerebrospinal fluid referrals in the national surveillance centres over the last years raises the concern of declining specificity due to higher number of cerebrospinal fluid tests performed in various neurological conditions. Within the framework of a European Community supported longitudinal multicentre study ('cerebrospinal fluid markers') we analysed the spectrum of rapid progressive dementia diagnoses, their potential influence on 14–3–3 specificity as well as results of other dementia markers (tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β 1–42) and evaluated the specificity of 14–3–3 in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease diagnosis for the years 1998–2008. A total of 29 022 cerebrospinal fluid samples were analysed for 14–3–3 protein and other cerebrospinal fluid dementia markers in patients with rapid dementia and suspected Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in the participating centres. In 10 731 patients a definite diagnosis could be obtained. Protein 14–3–3 specificity was analysed for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease with respect to increasing cerebrospinal fluid tests per year and spectrum of differential diagnosis. Ring trials were performed to ensure the comparability between centres during the reported time period. Protein 14–3–3 test specificity remained high and stable in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease during the observed time period across centres (total specificity 92%; when compared with patients with definite diagnoses only: specificity 90%). However, test specificity varied with respect to differential diagnosis. A high 14–3–3 specificity was obtained in differentiation to other neurodegenerative diseases (95–97%) and non-neurological conditions (91–97%). We observed lower specificity in the differential diagnoses of acute neurological diseases (82–87%). A marked and constant increase in cerebrospinal fluid test referrals per year in all centres did not influence 14–3–3 test specificity and no change in spectrum of differential diagnosis was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid protein 14–3–3 detection remains an important test in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Due to a loss in specificity in acute neurological events, the interpretation of positive 14–3–3 results needs to be performed in the clinical context. The spectrum of differential diagnosis of rapid progressive dementia varied from neurodegenerative dementias to dementia due to acute neurological conditions such as inflammatory diseases and non-neurological origin.

Results

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis-many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort, organised by The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008, provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings (so-called red flags) suggestive of alternative diagnoses. Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, CNS inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings; studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted. Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^114pmFbF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — differential diagnosis and prevalence across settings are outlined with policy metadata: Exceptions: None; Policy level: Recommendation; Differences of opinion: None. Differential diagnosis spans otologic, neurologic, and other entities, including Ménière's disease, Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis; neurologic conditions such as Vestibular migraine, Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack and stroke, Demyelinating diseases, Central nervous system lesions, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Central positional vertigo; and other entities including Anxiety or panic disorder, Cervicogenic vertigo, Medication side effects, Postural hypotension, and Various medical conditions (eg, toxic, infectious, and metabolic conditions). Epidemiology varies by setting: In a German telephone survey of > 1000 patients with dizziness, BPPV accounted for 8% of cases; in a British general practice setting, BPPV accounted for 42% of cases, followed by vestibular neuritis (41%), Ménière's disease (10%), vascular cases (3%), and other causes (3%); and in subspecialty populations, BPPV accounts for 20% to 53% of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat specialty clinics for dizziness. Diagnostic considerations note that BPPV has been described as occurring in conjunction with, or as a consequence of, other vestibular disorders as well, so clinicians should consider the possibility of > 1 vestibular disorder being present and emphasize that taking a history that focuses on the timing and triggers of a patient's dizziness is more important than the specific descriptor that patients use.
