## Question

A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of crampy abdominal pain and foul-smelling, watery diarrhea. One week ago, she underwent treatment of cellulitis with clindamycin. She has developed shortness of breath and urticaria after treatment with vancomycin in the past. Her temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F). Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3. An enzyme immunoassay is positive for glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and toxins A and B. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?
A. Inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan formation
B. Blocking of protein synthesis at 50S ribosomal subunit
C. Generation of toxic free radical metabolites
D. Inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the mechanism of action of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a patient with Clostridioides difficile infection, given recent clindamycin exposure and a history of vancomycin hypersensitivity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of CDI. Then, I should verify current guideline-preferred therapy for an initial episode. Next, I will examine the patient's allergy history and how it constrains options. After that, I need to check the mechanism of action of the correct agent. Finally, I will review alternatives and supportive care to ensure the plan is complete and safe.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has watery diarrhea, leukocytosis, and a positive stool assay for glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and toxins A/B, which together support CDI; the WBC of 12,800/mm3 suggests nonsevere disease by IDSA criteria, which define severe as WBC ≥ 15,000 or creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, so she is nonsevere at presentation [^115KzbbL] [^114wQjNc].

> Next, I should review guideline-preferred therapy for an initial episode. Current IDSA/SHEA-aligned guidance favors fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days as first-line for initial CDI, with oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days as an acceptable alternative; metronidazole is reserved only if neither is available due to inferior efficacy and recurrence outcomes [^115KzbbL] [^113E9cdo] [^112geqPP].

> Hold on, I should verify how the vancomycin allergy affects this. The patient has a history of shortness of breath and urticaria with vancomycin, consistent with a type I hypersensitivity reaction; given this, vancomycin is contraindicated, so the preferred agent here is fidaxomicin, with metronidazole as a fallback only if fidaxomicin is unavailable or not tolerated [^115KzbbL] [^112geqPP].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action of the correct agent. Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase at the sigma subunit, thereby blocking transcription and bacterial growth; this is distinct from agents that inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis or bind the 50S ribosome, and it aligns with its narrow spectrum and microbiome-sparing profile [^114FMLy4] [^111r1xjw].

> Wait, let me verify the distractors to ensure I'm not conflating mechanisms. Inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan formation describes beta-lactams and glycopeptides, not fidaxomicin; blocking protein synthesis at the 50S ribosomal subunit describes clindamycin and macrolides; generation of toxic free radical metabolites is characteristic of metronidazole, not fidaxomicin; thus, the correct mechanism for fidaxomicin is inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit.

> But wait, what if fidaxomicin is not accessible or contraindicated? I should double-check alternatives. If fidaxomicin cannot be used, metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days is an option, though it is less effective than fidaxomicin or vancomycin; in severe or complicated cases, rectal vancomycin or combination strategies may be considered, but given this patient's nonsevere presentation and vancomycin allergy, fidaxomicin remains optimal [^115KzbbL] [^112geqPP].

> I need to ensure supportive measures are addressed. Stop the offending systemic antibiotic when feasible, provide hydration and electrolyte correction, and consider adjunctive therapies for recurrence prevention in high-risk patients; bezlotoxumab is an option for those with risk factors for recurrence, and fecal microbiota products are indicated to prevent recurrence after antibiotic treatment for recurrent CDI, though they are not for acute treatment of active infection [^111RpyZW] [^1168trGZ] [^113aRwKy].

> Final answer: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is fidaxomicin, and its mechanism of action is inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit, which corresponds to option D [^115KzbbL].

---

The patient's presentation and labs are classic for **Clostrridoides difficile infection (CDI)** following clindamycin exposure [^1161G3a6], with positive GDH/toxins A/B confirming the diagnosis [^114wQjNc]. The most appropriate treatment is **fidaxomicin** [^113E9cdo] because it is first-line and safe in vancomycin allergy. Fidaxomicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase at the sigma subunit [^111r1xjw], making option D correct.

---

## Clinical diagnosis and indication for treatment

- **Clinical presentation**: Watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever following recent clindamycin use are highly suggestive of CDI [^115rHkjt].
- **Laboratory confirmation**: Positive GDH antigen and toxins A/B confirm CDI [^notfound].
- **Indication for treatment**: Confirmed CDI requires targeted antibiotic therapy [^113E9cdo].

---

## Recommended pharmacotherapy

Current guidelines recommend **fidaxomicin** as first-line therapy for initial CDI episodes [^113E9cdo] because of superior sustained clinical response and lower recurrence rates compared with vancomycin [^1179VNrG]. Given the patient's vancomycin allergy, fidaxomicin is the preferred option [^115KzbbL].

---

## Mechanism of action of fidaxomicin

Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that **selectively inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase at the sigma subunit** [^111r1xjw], thereby blocking transcription and bacterial growth. This narrow-spectrum activity minimizes disruption of normal gut flora, contributing to lower recurrence rates [^114FMLy4].

---

## Comparison with other options

| **Option** | **Mechanism of action** | **Relevance to cdi** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan formation | Incorrect; this is the mechanism of beta-lactams, not fidaxomicin [^notfound] |
| B | Blocking of protein synthesis at 50S ribosomal subunit | Incorrect; this is the mechanism of clindamycin, not fidaxomicin [^notfound] |
| C | Generation of toxic free radical metabolites | Incorrect; this is the mechanism of metronidazole, not fidaxomicin [^notfound] |
| D | Inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit | Correct; this is the mechanism of fidaxomicin [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications of fidaxomicin's mechanism

Fidaxomicin's selective inhibition of RNA polymerase results in **minimal disruption of normal gut flora**, reducing recurrence risk and improving sustained clinical response compared with vancomycin [^113E9cdo] [^1179VNrG].

---

## Conclusion and answer

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **fidaxomicin** [^113E9cdo], which inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase at the sigma subunit [^111r1xjw]. Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving BLUJEPA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. BLUJEPA is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to BLUJEPA [see Contraindications (4)]. Before therapy with BLUJEPA is instituted, carefully inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to BLUJEPA. If an allergic reaction to BLUJEPA occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.4 Clostridioides difficile Infection

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including BLUJEPA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDI. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDI must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDI has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDI is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing BLUJEPA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug‑resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available summarizing best diagnostic practices including 2-step diagnostic testing. Therapeutically, guideline recommendations more recently have favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based therapies and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations change, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have evolved and understand current best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### Cefazolin sodium [^111uk9Ve]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Cefazolin, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Beta-lactams

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefazolin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection occurs, discontinue the drug.

5.2 Seizures in Patients with Renal Impairment

Seizures may occur with the administration of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage is not reduced appropriately. Discontinue Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection if seizures occur or make appropriate dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders.

5.3 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

### Pivmecillinam (Pivya) [^113uhY7x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Acute Porphyria

PIVYA is contraindicated in patients suffering from porphyria as pivmecillinam has been associated with acute attacks of porphyria [see Contraindications (4.3)]. These episodes may be life-threatening, and include symptoms and signs such as anxiety, confusion, limb or abdominal pain, hyponatremia, seizures, and muscle weakness.

5.5 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile-a ssociated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including PIVYA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplement, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing PIVYA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or for prophylaxis is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.7 Interference with Newborn Screening Test

Treatment of a pregnant individual with PIVYA prior to delivery may cause a false positive test for isovaleric acidemia in the newborn as part of newborn screening. Prompt follow-up of a positive newborn screening result for isovaleric acidemia is recommended.

### Investigating the relationship between Helicobacter pylori and intestinal Clostridioides difficile infection: evidence from a cross-sectional study [^1169iaUB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with an increased risk of CDI. Different antibiotics may confer varying risks of CDI, with carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem), fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and third/fourth-generation cephalosporins being associated with a higher risk of CDI. Similarly, compared to a 7-day antibiotic course, a 14-day course is associated with a 27% increased risk of CDI. For treatment-naïve H.pylori–infected patients, the current ACG guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) for 14 days as the first-line regimen when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. The use of high-dose, long-duration broad-spectrum antibiotics raises significant concerns about the increased risk of CDI. For patients with an initial, non-severe episode of CDI, the latest IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID guidelines recommend fidaxomicin as the first-line treatment, with vancomycin and metronidazole as alternative options. Given the potential association between H.pylori infection and intestinal CDI, clinicians remain concerned that eradicating H. pylori in patients with concurrent CDI may exacerbate the course of the infection. Currently, the ACG guidelines on H.pylori infection, as well as the latest IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID guidelines for CDI, did not address treatment strategies for patients with concurrent H. pylori and Clostridioides difficile infections. Only Abboud et al. have reported a case of concurrent Helicobacter pylori and Clostridioides difficile infection and shared their clinical experience regarding the management of such co-infections. Given the observed association between H. pylori infection and CDI in this cross-sectional study, and the complexity of managing patients with concurrent H. pylori and CDI, we recommend considering screening for CDI in H. pylori-infected patients presenting with diarrhea. However, considering the exploratory nature of our study and the absence of validated risk stratification frameworks or evidence-based guidelines for managing co-infections of H. pylori and Clostridioides difficile, the clinical implications of our findings should be considered preliminary. While our results suggest a potential association that may warrant heightened clinical awareness, they are not intended to support specific screening protocols or treatment algorithms at this stage. In addition, our findings only suggest a potential association between H. pylori and CDI. Investigating the risk-benefit ratio of H. pylori therapy in the context of potential CDI risk is beyond the scope of this study. Such an analysis would require longitudinal data stratified by treatment regimens, comorbidities, and patient-specific risk factors, which were not available in our cross-sectional design. Future research incorporating detailed risk modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to quantify these clinical trade-offs and inform personalized, actionable treatment strategies.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^112T3nbh]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for pain therapy procedures is recommended for implantable pain therapies (class D procedures) and class C procedures, with reductions in wound infection risk by approximately 50%. Cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) are recommended as first-line agents; if a patient has a β‑lactam allergy, clindamycin is the preferred alternative; vancomycin is only recommended if the patient is colonized with MRSA or at high risk for MRSA, and in individuals with vancomycin allergy, daptomycin may be considered. Preoperative antibiotics should be administered intravenously prior to skin incision (30–60 min for cefazolin or clindamycin, 120 min for vancomycin), and redosing is needed when surgery duration exceeds antibiotic half-lives. Standard intravenous dosing for adults with normal renal function and redosing intervals are: cefazolin 1 g ≤ 60 kg; 2 g > 60 to 120 kg; 3 g > 120 kg within 30–60 min, half-life 1.2–2.2 hours, redosing 4 hours (first-line); clindamycin 900 mg within 30–60 min, half-life 2–4 hours, redosing 6 hours (β‑lactam allergy [preferred]); vancomycin 15 mg/kg within 120 min, half-life 4–8 hours, redosing NA (β‑lactam allergy: known MRSA colonization); daptomycin 6 mg/kg within 30–60 min, half-life 8–9 hours, redosing NA (vancomycin allergy: known MRSA colonization; known vancomycin-resistant enterococci).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111RpyZW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence prevention — bezlotoxumab is approved as an adjunct to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics for high-risk adults, with conditional use criteria and a limitation. Bezlotoxumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B approved for prevention of recurrent CDI in high-risk adults when used in conjunction with standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotic therapy, and the 2021 IDSA CDI Clinical Practice Guideline update suggests use of bezlotoxumab as a cointervention along with vancomycin as the SOC antibiotic in patients with a history of CDI in the last 6 months or other risk factors for recurrence (i.e., age ≥ 65 years, compromised immunity, severe CDI, or certain virulent strains (ribotypes 027/078/244). However, the benefit of bezlotoxumab is unknown when fidaxomicin is used as the SOC antibiotic therapy due to limited data.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^117KMVBc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients who had CDI in the previous 180 days who took 125 mg of prophylactic oral vancomycin during and for 5 days after a course of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy had lower rates of recurrent CDI than patients taking a placebo; however, this study was underpowered to find a statistically significant difference. There were high rates of recurrent CDI in both the treatment (43.6%) and the placebo (57.1%) groups. However, the study population was at particularly high risk for recurrent CDI given that all participants had a recent CDI and used systemic antibiotics. The median age of participants was 59 years, and older age is also a risk factor for recurrent CDI.

Previous prospective randomized clinical trials have had mixed findings on the effectiveness of oral vancomycin prophylaxis. A trial in asymptomatic patients with C difficile colonization found that oral vancomycin was temporarily effective in reducing C difficile shedding during and immediately after treatment, but most patients receiving oral vancomycin returned to shedding C difficile within approximately 3 weeks of completing treatment. Another randomized trial of oral vancomycin to prevent initial CDI in high-risk patients receiving systemic antibiotics found a significant reduction in health care facility–onset CDI in patients receiving oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. However, the follow-up period was limited. We had a longer follow-up period of 8 weeks to measure recurrent CDI incidence after completion of treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115KzbbL]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile–associated infection (CDI) treatment — For severe or nonsevere CDI, preferred therapy is "Fidaxomicin 200 mg PO two times per day for 10 days (AI)". Alternative therapy is "Vancomycin 125 mg PO four times per day for 10 days (AI)". If neither is available, "metronidazole 500 mg PO three times per day for 10 days (CI)". Based on comparative evidence, "vancomycin is superior to metronidazole for therapy of CDI". For recurrent CDI, "Use of fidaxomicin over oral vancomycin is recommended, in agreement with the 2021 IDSA CDI Guidelines, as it has a greater likelihood for a sustained clinical response at 30 days (AI)". "Vancomycin is an acceptable option (see IDSA Guideline for tapered and pulsed regimens) (AI)". "FMT may be considered after three CDI episodes (i.e., an initial and two recurrent episodes) (CIII)". Severity criteria are specified: "Severe CDI: white blood cell count ≥ 15,000 cells/mL or serum creatinine concentrations > 1.5 mg/dL; nonsevere CDI: white blood cell count < 15,000 cells/mL and serum creatinine concentrations < 1.5 mg/dL".

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^115JmnWX]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of health care–associated diarrhea. Over one-third of patients who develop CDI will develop 1 or more recurrences; recurrence risk increases with each episode. The main risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use. Following therapy and resolution of initial CDI, recurrent CDI may be triggered when antibiotics are given for other indications. Prevention is essential to reduce the myriad medical, social, and psychological consequences of recurrent CDI. Interventions to prevent recurrent CDI during exposure to systemic antibiotics in a person with prior but not current CDI are needed in clinical practice.

Oral vancomycin for prophylaxis against recurrent CDI has been used in clinical practice based on retrospective cohort studies showing possible favorable outcomes. However, their observational designs precluded assessing efficacy because of confounding, heterogeneity in data availability, inclusion criteria, study populations, and uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect. In a prospective trial in asymptomatic patients colonized with C difficile, oral vancomycin was effective in eliminating fecal C difficile during and immediately after treatment, but most participants began to shed C difficile again within approximately 3 weeks of completing oral vancomycin treatment.

Whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective against recurrent CDI remains unanswered. Furthermore, most studies have looked primarily at benefits of treatment without evaluating potential risks. This is a critical gap in the field, as oral vancomycin is not without risk (particularly, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] gut proliferation).,

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication. This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI.

### Cephalexin [^112Q1b9U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions in the form of rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin. Before therapy with cephalexin is instituted, inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment.

5.2 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin. Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported. If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy, perform a diagnostic work-up for drug-induced hemolytic anemia, discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy.

5.4 Seizure Potential

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures occur, discontinue cephalexin. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112SpAW8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Systemic antibiotic use for patients with a non-Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major risk factor for recurrent CDI. Increasing use of oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis against recurrent CDI in this context has uncertain efficacy.

Objective

To evaluate whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with placebo is effective against recurrent CDI during and 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 4 large health systems across the upper Midwest US. Adults who had completed treatment for CDI within the past 180 days and were taking a systemic antibiotic for a non-CDI indication were enrolled between May 21, 2018, and March 30, 2023, and followed up for 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Intervention

Participants were randomized 1:1 to 125 mg of oral vancomycin or placebo once daily during antibiotic use for a non-CDI plus 5 days following cessation of those antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was recurrent CDI incidence during treatment and the 8-week follow-up period. The secondary outcome was vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage in stool.

Results

Among 81 randomized participants (median age, 59 years [IQR, 50–67 years]), all were included in the primary as-randomized analysis (39 in the vancomycin group; 42 in the placebo group). Sixty patients (74.1%) completed 8-week follow-up and were included in the secondary as-completed treatment analysis (31 in the vancomycin group; 29 in the placebo group). Recurrent CDI occurred in 17 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (43.6%) and 24 of 42 in the placebo group (57.1%; absolute difference in percentage, -13.5% [95% CI, -35.1% to 8.0%]). Adverse events occurred in 27 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (69.2%) and 27 of 42 in the placebo group (64.3%). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage was found in 15 of 30 patients in the oral vancomycin group (50.0%) and 6 of 25 in the placebo group (24.0%) (P = 0.048) 8 weeks after treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, the incidence of recurrent CDI was lower (though did not reach significance) in participants taking oral vancomycin compared with those taking placebo. Because the study was underpowered, it was unable to reveal firm conclusions about the efficacy (or lack thereof) of vancomycin prophylaxis with respect to recurrent CDI.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to vancomycin in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male.

Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of vancomycin-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with vancomycin (≥ 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia.

Table 1: Common (≥ 5%) Adverse Reactions for Vancomycin Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile

Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin. Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin occurred in 6% of subjects > 65 years of age and 3% of subjects ≤ 65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects > 65 years of age than in subjects ≤ 65 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with vancomycin. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of vancomycin were C. difficile colitis (< 1%), nausea (< 1%), and vomiting (< 1%).

### Real-world use of bezlotoxumab to prevent recurrentinfections: a single-center experience and meta-analysis [^114Urbp7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients in the United States. Globally, the incidence of healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is estimated at 2.24 per 1000 admissions per year and 3.54 per 10,000 patient-days. While the overall incidence of CDI has declined in recent years, recurrence remains a significant hurdle in the treatment of CDI. Following an initial episode, up to 35% of patients experience a recurrence, and this risk increases to 65% in those with two or more prior infections. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is associated with significant clinical and economic burdens, including increased hospital readmissions, complications such as toxic megacolon and bowel perforation, and substantially higher healthcare costs.

Current strategies for managing CDI and preventing recurrence include optimizing antibiotic therapy and restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Standard-of-care antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin are effective in treating acute CDI and have some impact on recurrence risk. For instance, fidaxomicin has been shown to modestly lower recurrence rates compared to vancomycin in initial CDI treatment. In patients with multiple recurrences, prolonged or tapered antibiotic regimens are often used in an attempt to suppress relapse. Additionally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a highly effective treatment for patients with refractory or multiply recurrent CDI, with success rates often exceeding 80% in those scenarios. However, FMT is typically reserved for patients after multiple relapses and comes with practical challenges in standardization and access. Even with these approaches, many high-risk patients still suffer repeat infections, underscoring the need for adjunctive therapies that specifically target recurrence mechanisms. Evolving data suggest microbiome-based therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, fecal microbiota, live-jslm, and fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk may be effective in patients with rCDI (recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection).

### Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin and the effect on recurrence ofInfections [^114FMLy4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries. Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the national burden of CDI is over 450 000 cases and 8000 hospitalizations per year. Despite the inpatient incidence of CDI in the United States decreasing since 2011, outpatient incidence and mortality have not improved. Of patients who experience CDI, rates of recurrence are reported to range from 25% to 65% in people who have experienced multiple previous episodes. Beyond the quality of life burden for these patients, CDI recurrences also increase health care costs. Risk factors for CDI recurrence include age ≥ 65 years, proton pump inhibitor use, severe disease presentation, continued use of non-CDI antibiotics, and colonization with hypervirulent strains.

Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic recommended as the preferred agent for initial and recurrent CDI episodes, by both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines. Compared with the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, fidaxomicin has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity and is notable for inhibition of sporulation, which contributes to rapid recovery of disrupted microbiota in patients with CDI and theoretically should result in a decreased disruption of other enteric commensal bacteria. Previous literature has demonstrated lower rates of CDI recurrence with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin. - Despite acquisition cost being higher, impact from reduction in recurrences and admissions demonstrate overall cost-effectiveness.

In January 2018, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH) began utilizing fidaxomicin as the first line CDI agent for patients with a high risk of recurrence. Published literature from CRMH was significant for improved clinical and economical outcomes with fidaxomicin. However, despite increased availability and financial assistance, there continue to be barriers that exist and may impede successful completion of a full course of fidaxomicin. A transition to oral vancomycin during fidaxomicin therapy could exacerbate the probable dysbiosis associated with oral vancomycin and reduce the positive impact fidaxomicin has on recurrence reduction. The utility of fidaxomicin partial courses is not established in the literature, and there is a question of whether reduction in recurrences is preserved. The objective of this study was to evaluate rates of recurrence in full courses of fidaxomicin versus partial courses of fidaxomicin where partial therapy was completed with oral vancomycin.

### Fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (Vowst) [^113aRwKy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the intent-to-treat population consisting of all 182 randomized participants, 89 were in the VOWST group and 93 were in the placebo group. The participants had a mean age of 65.5 years (range, 18–100 years), 93.4% were white, 59.9% were female, and 73.1% received vancomycin.

The primary efficacy endpoint was CDI recurrence through 8 weeks after completion of treatment. Participants were assessed for recurrence, which was defined as ≥ 3 unformed stools per day for 2 consecutive days with continued diarrhea until antibacterial treatment was initiated, a positive C. difficile test on a stool sample determined by a toxin assay, and assessment by the Investigator that the clinical condition of the participant warranted antibacterial treatment.

Through 8 weeks after treatment, CDI recurrence in VOWST-treated participants was lower compared to that in placebo-treated participants (12.4% compared to 39.8%). VOWST met the pre-specified success criterion of the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the CDI relative risk lower than 0.83 (see Table 2).

Through 12 weeks after treatment, the recurrence rates for VOWST and placebo recipients were 18.0% (16/89) and 46.2% (43/93), respectively with a relative risk of 0.40 (95% CI 0.24,0.65). Through 24 weeks after treatment, recurrence rates for VOWST and placebo recipients were 21.3% (19/89) and 47.3% (44/93), respectively with a relative risk of 0.46 (95% CI 0.30, 0.73).

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women — evaluation: Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs. (Clinical Principle) Patients with rUTIs should have a complete history obtained, including LUTS such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence, hematuria, pneumaturia, and fecaluria; further information to obtain includes any history of bowel symptoms such as diarrhea, accidental bowel leakage, or constipation; recent use of antibiotics for any medical condition; prior antibiotic-related problems (e.g. C. difficile infection); antibiotic allergies and sensitivities; back or flank pain; catheter usage; vaginal discharge or irritation; menopausal status; post-coital UTI; contraceptive method; and use of spermicides or estrogen- or progesterone-containing products. Details of prior urinary tract or pelvic surgery should be obtained, and patients should be queried as to travel history and history of working or walking for long periods of time, and UTI history includes frequency of UTI, antimicrobial usage, and documentation of positive cultures and the type of cultured microorganisms. Patient history should document the symptoms the patient considers indicative of a UTI, the relationship of acute episodes to infectious triggers (e.g., sexual intercourse), antimicrobials used for each episode, responses to treatment for each episode, as well as the results of any prior diagnostic investigations, and it is also important to note the relationship of infections to hormonal influences (e.g., menstruation, menopause, exogenous hormone use) as well as concomitant medication usage or behaviors that may alter infection susceptibility, including prior antimicrobial treatment, immunomodulatory medications, and topicals such as spermicides. At the initial presentation for rUTI evaluation, a physical examination including an abdominal and detailed pelvic examination should be performed to look for any structural or functional abnormalities; pelvic support for the bladder, urethra, vagina, and rectum should be documented, noting the compartment and stage of any clinically significant prolapse; and the bladder and urethra should be palpated directly for evidence of urethritis, urethral diverticulum, Skene's gland cyst, or other enlarged vulvar or vaginal cysts.

### Azithromycin [^114yXMcV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Cardiovascular Death

Some observational studies have shown an approximately two-fold increased short-term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin. The five-day cardiovascular mortality observed in these studies ranged from20to 400 per million azithromycin treatment courses. This potential risk was noted to be greater during the first five days of azithromycin use and does not appear to be limited to those patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases. The data in these observational studies are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between acute cardiovascular death and azithromycin use. Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin.

5.6 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including azithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.7 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.

5.8 Use in Sexually Transmitted Infections

Azithromycin, at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat syphilis. Antibacterial agents used to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate testing for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed.

5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Treatment of primary episode of CDI, non-severe and severe

Recommendations on antibiotic treatment of the first episode of CDI are based on data largely extrapolated from trials conducted in the general population and smaller sub-groups of immunocompromised or cancer patients. Fidaxomicin had similar rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment compared to vancomycin (88–100% versus 80–86%) but lower rates of recurrence by the end of study (13–15% versus 15–27%), resulting in higher rate of global clinical cure with fidaxomicin (75–80% versus 62–64%). Observational studies in HM/HCT patients noted similar findings. In post-hoc analyses, rates of recurrence were significantly lower with fidaxomicin in patients with cancer and in those receiving concurrent antibiotic therapy. Lower rates of recurrence were also reported with the use of extended-pulse dosing of fidaxomicin compared to standard course of vancomycin, which can be particularly useful in selected situations, such as concomitant antibiotic therapy. Fidaxomicin has less impact on the microbiome. Therefore, fidaxomicin is preferred in patients at high risk of rCDI or microbiota disruption-related complications such as severe CDI, concomitant antibiotic treatment, and its main drawback is high acquisition cost.

In contrast, clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated significantly lower rates of clinical cure, sustained cure and higher recurrence rates with metronidazole compared to vancomycin or fidaxomicin, especially in immunocompromised patients. These findings were also reinforced in observational studies.

In case when oral intake is impossible, oral administration of first line agents is recommended through nasogastric tube (NGT). High dose of oral vancomycin (500 mg QID) was found of no benefit over standard dose (125 mg QID) in non-fulminant CDI. Despite lack of comparative data, high dose has been consistently used in case of NGT administration in most studies. Crushed fidaxomicin is stable and can be administered through NGT. Intravenous metronidazole has lower efficacy, and this should be taken into consideration when balancing the feasibility of oral intake and the need for NGT placement, particularly in patients with severe mucositis and thrombocytopenia.

Oral teicoplanin was approved for CDI treatment, based on efficacy reported in 2 small RCTs in '90, but is not universally available.

Resistance of C. difficile to vancomycin and metronidazole is very low (< 1–3%), and identification of mutations that confer resistance to fidaxomicin is very rare.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of VOWST was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled multi-center study (Study 1). The primary objective was to demonstrate the reduction of CDI recurrence with VOWST. Enrolled participants were 18 years of age or older and had a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent CDI (with a total of ≥ 3 episodes of CDI within 12 months). CDI episode at the study entry was defined as diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools per day for at least 2 consecutive days) and a positive C. difficile stool sample using a toxin assay. Participants were required to have symptom resolution, defined as < 3 unformed stools in 24 hours for 2 or more consecutive days prior to randomization, following 10 to 21 days of standard-of-care antibacterial treatment with vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Participants were stratified by antibacterial received (vancomycin or fidaxomicin) and age (< 65 years or ≥ 65 years) and randomized 1:1 to receive a dose of VOWST or placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days. The day prior to starting the assigned treatment regimen, participants were required to drink 296 mL (10 oz) of magnesium citrate or based on medical judgment, 250 mL polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (GoLYTELY, not approved for this use). Participants with impaired kidney function who were unable to take magnesium citrate took 250 mL polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution. All participants fasted for at least 8 hours before taking the first dose of VOWST. Participants were also required to continue fasting for 1 hour after the first day of treatment with VOWST. For Days 2 and 3, VOWST was taken in the morning before breakfast.

### Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin and the effect on recurrence ofInfections [^1133ftn3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes a significant national health care burden. Literature has demonstrated lower rates of CDI recurrence with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin. However, patients are sometimes switched to oral vancomycin before completing a fidaxomicin course.

Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate rates of CDI recurrence in full courses of fidaxomicin versus partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin.

Methods

In this single-center, retrospective, cohort study of adults with CDI, patients were screened for inclusion if they received either a full 10-day course of fidaxomicin or partial course of fidaxomicin followed by a switch to oral vancomycin. The primary outcome was the rate of CDI recurrence within 30 days after completion of initial therapy determined by a positive CDI test and initiation of treatment.

Results

Ninety-nine patients received a full course of fidaxomicin, and 95 patients received a partial course of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin. Mean age was lower in the full course group compared with the partial course (65.3 years vs 71.5 years, P < 0.002). Clostridioides difficile infection recurrence occurred in 5.1% of the full course group and 7.4% of the partial therapy group (P = 0.503) at 30 days and 13.1% versus 14.7% (P = 0.747) at 90 days. Clostridioides difficile infection-related readmissions at 30 days were similar in the full course and partial course groups (7.1% vs 4.2%, P = 0.389).

Conclusion and Relevance

Partial courses of fidaxomicin followed by oral vancomycin had similar 30-day CDI recurrence compared with full course fidaxomicin.

In two double-blind, controlled trials in pediatric patients with diarrhea and with or without enteric symptoms (e.g., abdominal distention, colic, left iliac fossa tenderness) caused by C. parvum, a three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide (100 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 12–47 months, 200 mg twice daily in pediatric patients ages 4 through 11 years) was compared with a placebo. One study was conducted in Egypt in outpatients ages 1 through 11 years with diarrhea caused by C. parvum. Another study was conducted in Zambia in malnourished pediatric patients admitted to the hospital with diarrhea caused by C. parvum. Clinical response was evaluated 3 to 7 days post-therapy with a 'well' response defined as 'no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools within the past 24 hours' or 'no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours'. The following clinical response rates were obtained:

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^111LsjJQ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN — amitriptyline for pediatric abdominal pain–disorders of gut–brain interaction (AP-DGBIs): Three studies compared a tricyclic antidepressant versus placebo (n = 291; age range 6–18 years) across all AP-DGBI subtypes. No GRADED conclusion could be drawn for treatment success, while tabled outcomes indicate amitriptyline may lead to more reduction in pain intensity (MD −2.40 (−3.08; −1.72)) and pain frequency (MD −2.80 (−3.57; −2.03)). Safety data from one study reported no significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events between amitriptyline and placebo (23.1% vs. 11.6%; RR 1.99 [95% CI 0.99; 4.03]). Certainty was low with considerable heterogeneity (I² = 93%), with studies favoring amitriptyline using longer durations (13 and 12 weeks) versus a negative study at 4 weeks and a high placebo success rate (52.3%). The GDG made a conditional recommendation for amitriptyline; ECG screening can be considered due to QTc prolongation, and prescription thresholds should be carefully considered with treatment prescribed only by experienced caregivers.

### Age-targeted vaccination for reducing Clostridioides difficile infection in england: a coupled mathematical-economic modelling analysis [^115cyNNM]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Current methods for reducing C. difficile transmission and CDI risk in the healthcare setting include patient isolation, antimicrobial stewardship, improved hand hygiene, environmental cleaning and reduced hospital length of stay. Fidaxomicin is currently the preferred treatment option by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA). More recently there has been increasing consensus among health authorities recommending faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) for use in second (ESCMID) or third recurrences (IDSA/SHEA). FMT can be delivered through either the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, both risking rare complications (aspiration and colonic perforation, respectively). There is no consensus in the superiority of either route, but results from a meta-analysis indicated a threefold increased hazard of treatment failure after 30 days following upper GI delivery (hazard ratio 3.43, 1.32–8.92). In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first faecal microbiota product to be taken orally to prevent CDI recurrence, so this method can be expected to feature in more CDI control programmes.

Typically, an assortment of control methods is used to varying degrees and it is not possible to disentangle the relative contributions of individual control methods used in a 'bundled' approach. However, their differential, concerted contribution has been reported to reduce CDI by 33–61%. An economic evaluation conducted by Brain et al. explored FMT, antimicrobial stewardship, improved hand hygiene and environmental cleaning demonstrated that a bundled approach of improved hand hygiene and environmental cleaning produced superior health benefits and cost-savings, along with the highest mean net monetary benefit.

In 2022, results were released from the CLOVER trial (CLO stridium difficile V accine E fficacy T R ial) — an international, phase 3, placebo-controlled and randomised study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the leading C. difficile vaccine candidate, PF-06425090. Though the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of prevention of primary CDI, it demonstrated 100% vaccine efficacy in reducing medically attended CDI, and safety reviews indicated that the investigational vaccine was safe and well tolerated. Here, a novel mathematical model of C. difficile transmission is presented and linked with the costs and utilities associated with morbidity and mortality, in order to evaluate the projected benefit of deploying a safe and efficacious C. difficile vaccine in England.

What is the most important information I should know about esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules?

Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules may help your acid-related symptoms, but you could still have serious stomach problems. Talk with your doctor.

Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules can cause serious side effects, including:

A type of kidney problem (acute t ubulointerstitial nephritis). Some people who take proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medicines, including Esomeprazole magnesium, may develop a kidney problem called acute tubulointerstitial nephritis that can happen at any time during treatment with Esomeprazole magnesium. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease in the amount that you urinate or if you have blood in your urine.
Diarrhea caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines. Call your doctor right away if you have watery stools or stomach pain that does not go away. You may or may not have a fever.
Bone fractures (hip, wrist, or spine). Bone fractures in the hip, wrist, or spine may happen in people who take multiple daily doses of PPI medicines and for a long period of time (a year or longer). Tell your doctor if you have a bone fracture, especially in the hip, wrist, or spine.
4 to 8 weeks for the healing and symptom relief of acid-related damage to the esophagus (erosive esophagitis or EE). Your doctor may prescribe another 4 to 8 weeks of esomeprazole magnesium in patients whose EE does not heal.
maintaining healing of EE.
4 to 8 weeks to treat heartburn and other symptoms that happen with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

### Level of awareness regarding MIS-C among medical students and surgeons in Switzerland [^115vroUn]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Of paramount interest to surgeons should be the possible similar presentation of patients with MIS-C/PIMS-TS and/or appendicitis. Symptoms such as acute vomiting and/or diarrhea could be typical for MIS-C/PIMS-TS. Diagnoses such as terminal ileitis, ascites or mesenteric lymphadenitis seem to be present in MIS-C/PIMS-TS at a higher rate than in other pathologies with gastrointestinal symptoms. There are descriptions of cases of MIS-C/PIMS-TS mimicking the symptoms of appendicitis, but also cases where the coexistence of both pathologies was present, posing a real challenge in the diagnostic procedure. It is to underline that it is not yet clear whether there is a causal relationship between the two. A study conducted by Vansevičienė et al. investigated a possible set of criteria to help in the identification of MIS-C/PIMS-TS in cases of typical acute appendicitis symptoms. This includes the following criteria: CRP > 55.8 mg, symptoms for more than 3 days, febrile fever and any other systems involved. Especially a known recent COVID-19 infection, contact or positive test should be a red flag. Another method of assessment is suggested by Manz et al. Assessment should be divided into three categories based on the timeline of the patient's handling: first assessment, intraoperative assessment and postoperative assessment. In the first step, it is important to look for an atypical history of appendicitis, diffuse abdominal pain, persistent fever, vomiting, mucocutaneous manifestations and confirmed or suspected recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intraoperatively, the presence of macroscopically atypical appendicitis, generalized intestinal inflammation, and the absence of explanatory findings for abdominal pain could implicate a possible MIS-C/PIMS-TS symptom. Finally, postoperatively, a lack of clinical improvement and persistently elevated inflammatory markers should lead to the same conclusion.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^1117BmAs]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Repairing a remote complication of abdominal penetrating trauma: diagnosis and management of a debilitating gastrocolic fistula [^11555Qsr]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical dilemma

A young adult with a body mass index (BMI) of 16.5 was admitted to the hospital with mild abdominal pain and failure to thrive. Four years earlier, the patient sustained a right-to-left abdominal gunshot wound, injuring the first portion of the duodenum, pancreas, jejunum, and colon. Their surgical history was somewhat unclear but, from sparse operative reports, we surmised that they underwent a damage control laparotomy followed by multiple small bowel resections, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, primary repair of the duodenum, partial colectomy, common bile duct exploration, cholecystectomy, diverting loop ileostomy, and eventual ileostomy takedown. Throughout the year prior to admission, the patient lost over 50 pounds and had emergency room visits for chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, and weight loss, despite adequate oral intake. Prior clinicians diagnosed the patient with enteritis and encouraged increased per os intake with nutrient-rich dietary supplements. The patient presented to our hospital for a second opinion given worsening cachexia, weakness, and abdominal symptoms.

On examination, the patient was gaunt with significant temporal muscle wasting and a visible anatomic snuff box. The patient could barely walk due to weakness and reported foul-smelling eructation and diarrhea. Surgical consultation prompted an upper gastrointestinal study with contrast, which revealed a large, complex gastrocolic fistula with complete emptying of gastric contents into the transverse colon, bypassing the entire small bowel (figure 1). Prior records documented a history of large marginal ulcers at the gastrojejunostomy site. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was significant for a wide-mouthed gastrocolic fistula near the known gastrojejunostomy.

Case Report

Presentation

A 30-year-old male initially presented at a local hospital with progressive complaints of back pain and swollen legs for 4 days. He had no relevant medical history besides a pyloromyotomy and orchidopexy as a child. He was able to walk, but his legs felt heavy and numb. Defecation was absent for 2 days and urinary miction was difficult, but still possible. He had no cardiac or respiratory complaints. His body mass index was 26.3 kg/m², he was a current smoker for 10 years, and did not use any medication.

Examination

Both legs of the patient were red and swollen, with intact motor functions. He had an altered saddle sensation with numbness around the anus, a lowered sphincter tension, and a lowered anal reflex. Plantar reflexes of the feet were indifferent on both sides. The femoral, popliteal, tibial posterior, and dorsalis pedis pulses were all palpable bilaterally. His clinical presentation was suggestive for an incomplete CES.

Computed tomography angiography (CTa) showed an extensive thrombus in the IVC and left and right common and external iliac veins, as shown in Figure 1. Collaterals at the level of the renal veins were indicative of a chronic stenosis of the IVC. Coincidental findings were a mild splenomegaly and a small abnormality around the pyelum of the right kidney. Direct nerve root compression due to venous congestion was revealed on MRI with decreased venous outflow of the nerve roots itself, shown in Figure 2. Cerebrospinal fluid was missing around the nerve roots of L4-L5, possibly because of epidural lipomatosis combined with mild bulging of the lumbar disk and congestion of the venous plexus leading to enlarged epidural veins.

Medical specialists of the department of vascular surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, hematology, and (interventional) radiology were involved. Based on the clinical findings and findings on CTa and MRI, the most likely cause of CES was the iliocaval DVT. The patient started therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin and was referred to our tertiary hospital for thrombolysis and potentially venous stenting of the IVC.

### Sirolimus (Hyftor) [^116q2NAG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, and hypersensitivity vasculitis have been associated with the oral administration of sirolimus. The concomitant use of HYFTOR with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. Elevated sirolimus levels (with or without concomitant ACE inhibitors) may also potentiate angioedema. Discontinue HYFTOR immediately if symptoms of hypersensitivity occur.

5.2 Serious Infection

Serious infections, including opportunistic infections, have been reported after oral administration of sirolimus. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with oral sirolimus. Discontinue HYFTOR immediately if symptoms of infection occur.

5.3 Malignancy

Lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, have been observed after oral administration of sirolimus. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using HYFTOR. If patients need to be outdoors while using HYFTOR, they should wear protective clothing and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician.

5.4 Hyperlipidemia

Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment have been observed with oral administration of sirolimus. Monitor for hyperlipidemia during treatment with HYFTOR.

5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis

Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving oral sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dosage reduction of oral sirolimus. Discontinue HYFTOR immediately if symptoms of ILD occur.

5.6 Immunizations

During treatment with HYFTOR, vaccinations may be less effective. Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines prior to initiating treatment with HYFTOR. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with HYFTOR.

difficile. 17 The risks of other individual antibiotics for the development of C difficile infection have not been evaluated in large prospective studies, but the antibiotics most frequently associated with infection in addition to clindamycin have been ampicillin, amoxicillin, and the cephalosporins. 17 However, all antibiotics have been associated with CDAD, and clinicians should be aware that nonessential antibiotic prescription can lead to morbidity and mortality due to C difficile infection18. times per day) with oral vancomycin hydrochloride, each given for 10 days, and have shown that these therapies are equally efficacious in resolving symptoms as well as in the subsequent risk for relapse. 83, 86 Another study examined different doses of vancomycin hydrochloride. and showed that an oral dose of 125 mg qid was equivalent to one of 500 mg qid for 10 days for symptomatic response and risk for subsequent relapse.

87 In many series of patients, therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin was effective in resolving symptoms in more than 95% of patients, although 10% to 20% of patients subsequently experienced relapse. 22, 71, 81. However, some authorities prefer initial therapy with vancomycin in the most severely ill patients, or in women who are pregnant. 74, 81 The duration of initial therapy should be 10 to 14 days. In critically ill patients who are unable to take oral antimicrobials, treatment is empirical and may include intravenous metronidazole or administration of vancomycin by means of rectal enema or through long catheters in the small intestine. Intravenous treatment can be used with metronidazole but not vancomycin. Occasionally, surgery is required. 5, 73.

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea and is a leading cause of diarrhea in the elderly. The antibiotics most frequently associated with infection are clindamycin, ampicillin and/or amoxicillin, and cephalosporins; however, all antibiotics have been associated with CDAD, and nonessential antibiotic prescription should be avoided. 107 The clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhea to severe debilitating infection.
