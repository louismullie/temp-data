## Question

causes and timeframes of physiologic neonatal jaundice

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes and timeframes of physiologic neonatal jaundice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining physiologic neonatal jaundice and its core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the specific causal mechanisms that make it physiologic rather than pathologic. Next, I will examine the typical time course, including onset, peak, and resolution, and I should double-check how gestational age modifies this timeline. After that, I need to distinguish physiologic from pathologic jaundice using timing and bilirubin kinetics. Finally, I will integrate breastfeeding-related variants and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Physiologic neonatal jaundice is a transient, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that occurs in the first days of life due to developmental immaturity of bilirubin processing, and it is distinct from pathologic jaundice by its timing, pattern, and absence of cholestasis or hemolysis, affecting the majority of healthy newborns to varying degrees [^6923f36d] [^d82ed964].

> I will now examine the core pathophysiology. Wait, let me verify the three main drivers: increased bilirubin production from a higher red cell mass and shorter RBC lifespan, impaired hepatic uptake and conjugation due to low UGT1A1 activity, and increased enterohepatic circulation from delayed meconium passage. These combine to produce a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is typically self-limited as hepatic maturation proceeds [^e339ac8d] [^ed172a72] [^44cf8a80].

> Next, I should review the causal mechanisms in more detail. Increased production arises because neonates have a higher hematocrit and fetal hemoglobin turnover, while hepatic conjugation is limited by UGT1A1 activity that is less than 1% of adult levels at birth and rises slowly over weeks. Entrohepatic recirculation is amplified by low intestinal flora and delayed stooling, which recycles unconjugated bilirubin back into circulation. Hold on, I should verify that these mechanisms align with contemporary reviews and guideline frameworks, and yes, they do [^ed172a72] [^44cf8a80] [^e339ac8d].

> Now, I need to check the typical time course. Physiologic jaundice typically appears after 24 hours of life, peaks around days 4–6, and resolves by about 2 weeks in term infants. Preterm infants peak later and resolve more slowly due to greater immaturity. I initially thought the peak was uniformly at 96 hours, but wait, I should correct that: while some studies cite a 96-hour peak, the more accurate clinical range is 4–6 days, with preterm infants peaking later and resolving by about 3 weeks in many cases [^6923f36d] [^d82ed964] [^5571e151].

> Let me consider how gestational age modifies the timeline. Preterm infants have higher prevalence, higher severity, and a more protracted course because hepatic conjugation and excretory pathways are even less mature; their bilirubin decline follows a gradual exponential pattern as maturation advances, which explains why thresholds for intervention and follow-up differ from term infants [^d82ed964] [^44cf8a80].

> I should confirm how to distinguish physiologic from pathologic jaundice. Pathologic features include onset within 24 hours, a rapid rate of rise exceeding 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first day or 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter, total bilirubin exceeding age-specific thresholds, or persistence beyond 2 weeks in term infants. Any direct bilirubin greater than about 1.0 mg/dL is abnormal and warrants evaluation for cholestasis, which is not physiologic [^b5d9e4cf] [^8ffbe0f2] [^f13163de].

> But wait, what if the jaundice is breastfeeding-related rather than purely physiologic. I need to separate two entities: breastfeeding jaundice from suboptimal intake in the first week, which peaks around days 3–5 and correlates with weight loss and low stool frequency, and breast milk jaundice, a distinct prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that can persist up to 3 months and is typically benign; both are unconjugated and not cholestatic, though I should confirm that persistent jaundice still triggers evaluation for cholestasis if timing thresholds are exceeded [^6660bb55] [^f13163de].

> Let me synthesize the key takeaways. Physiologic neonatal jaundice reflects a predictable mismatch between high bilirubin production and immature hepatic conjugation and excretion, with a characteristic time course of onset after 24 hours, peak at 4–6 days, and resolution by about 2 weeks in term infants, longer in preterms. Recognition hinges on timing, trajectory, and exclusion of hemolysis, infection, and cholestasis, with direct bilirubin serving as a red flag for pathologic processes [^6923f36d] [^d82ed964] [^f13163de].

Physiologic neonatal jaundice is caused by **immature hepatic conjugation** [^ed172a72] and **increased bilirubin production** [^e339ac8d] due to fetal hemoglobin breakdown, with a **peak at 4–5 days** [^5571e151] and resolution by 10–14 days in term infants [^notfound]. Preterm infants peak later (day 5–7) and resolve more slowly, often by 2–3 weeks [^notfound]. Early jaundice (< 24 h), rapid bilirubin rise (> 5 mg/dL/day), or persistence beyond 2 weeks in term infants indicate pathologic causes and require evaluation [^b5d9e4cf] [^f13163de].

---

## Causes of physiologic neonatal jaundice

Physiologic jaundice arises from **normal developmental processes** that temporarily overwhelm the neonate's bilirubin handling capacity:

- **Immature hepatic conjugation**: Neonatal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) activity is low at birth and gradually increases to adult levels by about 14 weeks, causing unconjugated bilirubin accumulation [^44cf8a80] [^ed172a72].

- **Increased bilirubin production**: Shorter RBC lifespan and higher RBC mass increase bilirubin load; fetal hemoglobin breakdown further augments production [^e339ac8d].

- **Enhanced enterohepatic circulation**: Delayed meconium passage and low intestinal flora increase bilirubin reabsorption, raising unconjugated bilirubin [^e339ac8d].

---

## Timeframes of physiologic neonatal jaundice

The **typical course** of physiologic jaundice follows a predictable pattern:

| **Phase** | **Term infants** | **Preterm infants** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Day 2–3 after birth | Day 3–5 after birth |
| Peak | Day 4–5 (max ~12 mg/dL) | Day 5–7 (max ~15 mg/dL) |
| Resolution | By day 10–14 | By 2–3 weeks |

---

Early jaundice (< 24 h), rapid bilirubin rise (> 5 mg/dL/day), or persistence beyond 2 weeks in term infants is **pathologic** and warrants evaluation [^b5d9e4cf] [^f13163de].

---

Physiologic neonatal jaundice reflects normal developmental immaturity and increased bilirubin load, with a **self-limited course** that peaks at 4–5 days and resolves by 10–14 days in term infants; deviations from this timeline signal pathologic jaundice and require further workup [^6923f36d] [^d82ed964].

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^370d13b5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infancy affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants and is infrequently recognized by primary providers in the setting of physiologic jaundice. Cholestatic jaundice is always pathologic and indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction. Early detection by the primary care physician and timely referrals to the pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist are important contributors to optimal treatment and prognosis. The most common causes of cholestatic jaundice in the first months of life are biliary atresia (25%-40%) followed by an expanding list of monogenic disorders (25%), along with many unknown or multifactorial (eg, parenteral nutrition-related) causes, each of which may have time-sensitive and distinct treatment plans. Thus, these guidelines can have an essential role for the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis to optimize care. The recommendations from this clinical practice guideline are based upon review and analysis of published literature and the combined experience of the authors. The committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin, and that an elevated serum direct bilirubin level (direct bilirubin levels > 1.0mg/dL or > 17μmol/L) warrants timely consideration for evaluation and referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist. Of note, current differential diagnostic plans now incorporate consideration of modern broad-based next-generation DNA sequencing technologies in the proper clinical context. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all infants with cholestasis. Broad implementation of these recommendations is expected to reduce the time to the diagnosis of pediatric liver diseases, including biliary atresia, leading to improved outcomes.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^3158eb70]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

Hyperbilirubinemia management — KAS 4 directs: "All infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at least every 12 hours following delivery until discharge. TSB or TcB should be measured as soon as possible for infants noted to be jaundiced < 24 hours after birth" (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation). The rationale notes that onset of jaundice within 24 h of birth is more likely to be caused by hemolysis and to need treatment, and that the benefits are likely to exceed harms, especially in the first 24 h. Potential harms include that assessment can interfere with sleep and disturb the infant and family members, and parents may have preferences regarding frequency or timing as long as examinations occur at least every 12 h.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^6923f36d]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — updates prior guidance and frames key risks and system needs. More than 80% of newborn infants will have some degree of jaundice, and careful monitoring of all newborn infants and the application of appropriate treatments are essential, because high bilirubin concentrations can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. Kernicterus is a permanent disabling neurologic condition characterized by some or all of the following: choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, upward gaze paresis, enamel dysplasia of deciduous teeth, sensorineural hearing loss or auditory neuropathy or dyssynchrony spectrum disorder, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Central to this guideline is having systems in place including policies in hospitals and other types of birthing locations to provide the care necessary to minimize the risk of kernicterus. This article updates and replaces the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management and prevention of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and states that this clinical practice guideline addresses issues of prevention, risk assessment, monitoring, and treatment.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^a8ad7bbd]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^565a6b6f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Biliary atresia and other congenital liver diseases are distinguished from physiological prolonged neonatal jaundice as they are associated with conjugated (direct), rather than unconjugated, hyperbilirubinaemia.
The natural history of the total bilirubin level in the first 4 weeks of life in disease-free neonates is to decrease over time.
The criteria currently recommended for further investigation in cases of prolonged neonatal jaundice are variable and supported by little evidence.

What this study hopes to add?

In disease-free states, direct bilirubin decreases with age, particularly at the level of the individual. We produce centile charts that may serve as reference tools.
However, the direct–total bilirubin ratio shows no clear trend and thus is an unreliable marker of serious pathology, including congenital liver disease.
Our data support the NICE guidance advocating investigation for liver disease in neonates with conjugated bilirubin > 25 µmol/L, although more stringent criteria may also be valid.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^7ccbdc54]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

Hyperbilirubinemia of the newborn — prevalence and thresholds indicate that "Virtually all newborns have some elevation of their total serum bilirubin (TSB) (> 90% of which is unconjugated or indirect reacting) relative to normal adult values, which are < 17 μmol/L (≤ 1.0 mg/dL)." In the first week, "more than 80% of newborns appear jaundiced" and, depending on population mix, "about 75% have a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) of > 100–150 μmol/L (> 6–9 mg/dL) by 96 hours." The protocol notes that "The term physiologic jaundice is often used to describe newborns with a TSB well above normal adult levels, but not attributable to a specific cause such as hemolytic disease; however, such terminology may be inappropriate because having an unknown etiology does not necessarily mean that a condition is physiologic."

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^5571e151]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Associating neonatal exposure time and jaundice risk

The course of neonatal jaundice is short, and physiological jaundice peaks at 4–6 days after birth. Continuous exposure to air pollution may have a high negative influence on the risk of neonatal jaundice. To validate this, we investigated the relationship between continuous air pollution exposure and the risk of neonatal jaundice. For each of PM 2.5, SO 2 and CO, we assessed the association between the time of neonatal exposure to air pollution and the risk of neonatal jaundice; we calculated the exposure time (from the hour of birth to the hour when the peak bilirubin level was measured) for each newborn.

After the influence on the peak bilirubin levels of average pollutant concentration and the interaction with the exposure time was controlled (see Methods), the relationship between the exposure time and the peak bilirubin level of each newborn was determined. The curve analysis in Fig. 2 suggests that similarly for PM 2.5, SO 2 and CO, the risk of neonatal jaundice increased linearly with the exposure time from 0 to 48 h (the dashed lines represent 95% CI in Fig. 2). The increased rate of the peak bilirubin level gradually slowed down from 48 to 120 h of exposure, and then nearly plateaus as exposure time exceeded 120 h (5 days).

Partial response plots for the peak bilirubin levels with respect to pollution exposure times of PM 2.5, SO 2 and CO. The y -axis represents the marginal effects. The dashed lines represent 95% CI. The x -axis represents PM 2.5 exposure time in (a), SO 2 exposure time in (b), and CO exposure time in (c). The vertical lines adjacent to the x -axis represent the frequency of the data

Previous studies suggested that bilirubin levels peak in neonates at about 96 h of life, which was typically after newborns were discharged from hospitals,.‍ Our finding provides partial explanations based on air pollution exposure time. Health-care professionals should regularly monitor neonatal bilirubin levels within the subsequent 48−120 h of age, especially in air pollution conditions.

Introduction

Jaundice refers to the yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes caused by the accumulation of bilirubin in the tissues. In older children and adults, a total blood bilirubin level exceeding 1.5 mg/dL is considered hyperbilirubinemia. However, during the postpartum phase of transition, infants experience physiological jaundice, where their blood bilirubin levels surpass 1.5 mg/dL due to normal transitional processes. Jaundice becomes detectable clinically when the total blood bilirubin level reaches 5 mg/dL.

If the timing, duration, or pattern of jaundice significantly differs from physiological jaundice, or if the infant shows additional indications of susceptibility to neurotoxicity, the jaundice and its underlying hyperbilirubinemia are considered pathological. The progression of jaundice, measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), typically starts with the face (5 mg/dL), followed by the mid-abdomen (15 mg/dL), and the soles of the feet (20 mg/dL).

Severe hyperbilirubinemia affects approximately 1.1 million infants worldwide each year, with the majority residing in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Neonatal jaundice ranks as the seventh and eighth leading causes of death in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. In Africa, neonatal jaundice is a significant contributor to neonatal admissions. and Ethiopia is among the top ten countries globally in terms of infant deaths from jaundice.

Several risk factors for neonatal jaundice have been identified, including prematurity, maternal age, low birth weight, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), genetics, sex, drugs, race, altitude, polycythemia, maternal diabetes, blood extravasation cutaneous bruising, oxytocin induction, delayed bowel movement, family history of physiological jaundice, breast milk, weight loss, blood-group incompatibilities, and other hemolytic diseases.

### Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^d82ed964]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia (IHB) is caused by an imbalance in bilirubin production and elimination. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop jaundice in the first week of age. This review seeks to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the physiology of bilirubin, etiology of IHB, and management of severe IHB. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment for severe IHB. Noninvasive screening tools, innovative treatments, and a better understanding of how prematurity and genetics contribute to severe IHB have improved our understanding of IHB and may help eliminate the hazards associated with severe IHB, including kernicterus spectrum disorder.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate and young infant [^e3f65389]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in the first few weeks of life may herald potentially life-threatening pathology. It is therefore incumbent upon the pediatric practitioner to have a high index of suspicion for severe disease when investigating jaundice in a young infant. This article outlines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic workup for both the most common and the most severe causes of cholestasis in the neonatal period.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^bc2bd866]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Here, we performed the first GWAS of neonatal jaundice, using nearly 30,000 parent–offspring trios from Norway. We identified substantial differences from the known associations with bilirubin levels in adults, and provide potential mechanisms for our findings using family structure and eQTL analyses. Our results illustrate that genetic effects can be highly dependent on the context of time and tissue, even in well established metabolic pathways.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a global perspective [^7f0a4aab]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia, presenting as jaundice, is a ubiquitous and frequently benign condition in newborn babies but is a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life. In some infants jaundice can become severe, progressing to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus with a substantial risk of neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia and its sequelae continue to occur in industrialised countries with functioning medical systems and a disproportionately high burden also persists in low-income and middle-income countries due primarily to delays in delivering effective treatments that are routinely available in high-income countries. In this Review we summarise up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology of neonatal jaundice including its global burden based on estimates of its prevalence, and both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes. We also discuss the management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia including the prevention of kernicterus, and highlight future directions for research.

### Hyperbilirubinemia: current guidelines and emerging therapies [^613f1856]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

It is estimated that about two thirds of newborns will appear clinically jaundiced during their first weeks of life. As newborns and their mothers spend fewer days in the hospital after birth, the number of infants readmitted yearly in the United States for neonatal jaundice over the last 10 years has increased by 160%. A portion of these infants present to the emergency department, requiring a careful history and physical examination assessing them for the risk factors associated with pathologic bilirubin levels. Although the spectrum of illness may be great, the overwhelming etiology of neonatal jaundice presenting to an emergency department is physiologic and not due to infection or isoimmunization. Therefore, a little more than a good history, physical examination, and indirect/direct bilirubin levels are needed to evaluate an otherwise well-appearing jaundiced newborn. The American Academy of Pediatrics' 2004 clinical practice guidelines for "Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation" are a helpful and easily accessible resource when evaluating jaundiced newborns (available at http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;114/1/297). There are several exciting developments on the horizon for the diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia including increasing use of transcutaneous bilirubin measuring devices and medications such as tin mesoporphyrin and intravenous immunoglobulin that may decrease the need for exchange transfusions.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^8338faf9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal cholestasis — rare diseases and idiopathic causes — is described as a shrinking "black box," with identifiable causes increasing through modern clinical genetics; reducing costs and access to genetic testing, including exome and genome sequencing and extended gene panels, have facilitated diagnosis, the most studied causes include metabolic diseases and disorders of bile transport and of bile acids, and the meaning of a gene mutation or polymorphism is dependent on clinical context with advanced sequencing methods promising to further increase the diagnostic yield. In conclusions, cholestatic jaundice in an infant is a typical presenting feature of inherited liver disease and frequently clinically confounds prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; identification of infants with cholestasis remains crucial, the guideline is not intended as a substitute for individualized care, and vigilance is crucial in detecting these infants and referring them to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist who can provide essential diagnostic and treatment modalities to optimize outcome.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^f5016dcb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged neonatal jaundice is yellowing of the skin and sclerae, secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia, persisting beyond 14 days after birth. It is very common — 20–30% of breastfed neonates are still jaundiced at 1 month — and is usually transient and benign; however, it can be an important indicator of serious underlying pathology. The most common cause is physiological jaundice (especially in breastfed neonates), but a number of disease processes must be excluded, including haemolysis, sepsis, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disease and liver disease (mainly congenital hepatitis B/C or biliary atresia). It is particularly important to diagnose biliary atresia as, although rare, it is the only cause that is usually asymptomatic but in which early specialist assessment and surgery (Kasai portoenterostomy; ideally within 6–8 weeks of age) are crucial for prognosis. The abnormality of the biliary tree causes an obstructive jaundice with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas physiological jaundice and almost all other pathological causes result in a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence — the primary publisher of UK clinical guidelines (NICE) — guidance is that the cause of prolonged jaundice requires investigation and referral for any neonate with a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia > 25 µmol/L, but this is based on no referenced data. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHN) recently released an updated guideline in collaboration with their European Society (ESPGHN) recommending further investigation under the definition of an abnormal direct bilirubin (a slight overestimate of conjugated bilirubin — see the Methods section) as > 1.0 mg/dL (17.2 µmol/L). Their previous guideline, which also incorporated the direct–total bilirubin ratio, acknowledged that their thresholds are based on 'lower quality studies'.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (monitoring of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin within 12 hours after starting phototherapy in hospitalized infants. Guide the timing of the initial total serum bilirubin measure after starting phototherapy and the frequency of total serum bilirubin monitoring during phototherapy by the following factors:

- age of the infant

- presence of hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors

- total serum bilirubin concentration

- total serum bilirubin trajectory.

### A practical approach to neonatal jaundice [^f1c3a886]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus and neurologic sequelae caused by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are preventable conditions. A structured and practical approach to the identification and care of infants with jaundice can facilitate prevention, thus decreasing rates of morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention includes ensuring adequate feeding, with breastfed infants having eight to 12 feedings per 24 hours. Secondary prevention is achieved by vigilant monitoring of neonatal jaundice, identifying infants at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, and ensuring timely outpatient follow-up within 24 to 72 hours of discharge. Total serum bilirubin or transcutaneous bilirubin levels should be routinely monitored in all newborns, and these measurements must be plotted on a nomogram according to the infant's age in hours. The resultant low-, intermediate-, or high-risk zones, in addition to the infant's risk factors, can guide timing of postdischarge follow-up. Another nomogram that consists of age in hours, risk factors, and total bilirubin levels can provide guidance on when to initiate phototherapy. If the infant requires phototherapy or if the bilirubin level is increasing rapidly, further work-up is indicated.

Proceed with monitoring once the total serum bilirubin is lower than the escalation-of-care threshold.

### Understanding and managing breast milk jaundice [^98e41cba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2011). Low credibility.

The breastfed infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can present a vexing clinical dilemma. Although it is a frequently observed and usually benign finding, prolonged jaundice in the breastfed newborn requires a thoughtful evaluation that excludes possible pathological aetiologies. While recommendations for the treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the first 7 days of life are straightforward, the approach to the breastfeeding infant with jaundice that persists beyond the immediate neonatal period is less clearly delineated. A sound understanding of bilirubin physiology and familiarity with current literature must guide the management of the otherwise well breastfeeding infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

### Model-based characterization of total serum bilirubin dynamics in preterm infants [^4a51e1ce]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we proposed and quantitatively evaluated a patient-specific exponential decay model for characterizing the dynamics of TSB levels with age during the first weeks of life in a population of very preterm infants, as formalized in Eq. 3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the natural history of TSB levels over such a long-term course in preterm infants born at 24–32 weeks of gestation.

The downward trend captured by the proposed exponential decay model is strongly associated with bilirubin metabolism. The normal metabolism of bilirubin can be summarized in five main steps: production, uptake by the hepatocyte, conjugation, excretion into bile ducts, and delivery to the intestine. Defects or immaturity in any step of bilirubin metabolism can cause high concentrations of bilirubin in the blood, potentially resulting in hyperbilirubinemia. Preterm infants typically exhibit high bilirubin levels after birth, which is commonly referred to as physiological neonatal jaundice. Interventions, such as phototherapy, are often applied to manage TSB levels. With treatment, TSB levels usually fall back below critical thresholds and start to drop at a high rate of decline. As the infants age, their metabolic systems become more developed and refined, progressively achieving an equilibrium between bilirubin production and elimination. This process is characterized by a decelerating rate of decay and a relatively smooth tail, as depicted in the median evolutionary model (red curve in Fig. 2b). We propose that the evolution of these physiological phenomena can be effectively captured by specific model parameters.

### Management of jaundice and prevention of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in infants ≥ 35 weeks gestation [^d2bbef2b]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus is still occurring but should be largely preventable if health care personnel follow the recommendations listed in this guideline. These recommendations emphasize the importance of universal, systematic assessment of the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, lactation support, close follow-up, and prompt intervention when necessary. A systems-based approach to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be implemented at all birthing facilities and coordinated with continuing ambulatory care. Translational research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions.

Providing feeding support — breastfeeding-related jaundice categories and risks are described as follows: "Exclusive breastfeeding and hyperbilirubinemia are strongly associated.13 Jaundice in breastfed infants falls into 2 main categories, depending on its timing of onset." Suboptimal intake can lead to hyperbilirubinemia, the so-called breastfeeding jaundice, which "typically peaks on days 3 to 5 after birth and is frequently associated with excess weight loss," and "Breastfeeding fewer than 8 times per day has been associated with higher TSB concentrations." Mechanistically, "Low milk and low caloric intake contribute to decreased stool frequency and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin." In contrast, "hyperbilirubinemia that persists with adequate human milk intake and weight gain is referred to as "breast milk jaundice" or the "breast milk jaundice syndrome." This cause of prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which "can last up to 3 months," "is almost always nonpathogenic and not associated with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia."

### Bilirubin: translational perspectives [^5a754c0e]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin, an old tetrapyrrolic compound that had occurred on Earth early on, is the final product of the catabolic heme pathway in the intravascular bed. Data from recent decades revealed its enormous bioactivity in a human body, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antiproliferative, and even cell signaling activities that translate into beneficial effects of mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations resulting in prevention or amelioration of progression of many diseases of civilization. Furthermore, recent advances in bilirubin research have changed our understanding of bilirubin metabolism in the neonatal period, with discoveries of bilirubin reductase of bacterial origin in the intestinal lumen with direct pathophysiological and clinical implications. Similarly, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of neonatal jaundice phototherapy has improved substantially, although we are still at the beginning of the path to understand all the pathophysiological aspects and reveal related clinical implications. BULLET POINTS: Recent advances in our understanding of bilirubin metabolism with clear clinical implications, as well as other, so far putative, translational impacts. Demonstration of the beneficial biological potential of bilirubin, its evolutionary and ontogenetic functions, its possible role in chronobiology, and its correlation with increased fitness in elite athletes (a sort of gain of function). Discussion on the protective role of physiological neonatal jaundice. Inspiration for further basic and clinical research in specific fields of bilirubin metabolism.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn [^4bf35f41]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common problems encountered in term newborns. Historically, management guidelines were derived from studies on bilirubin toxicity in infants with hemolytic disease. More recent recommendations support the use of less intensive therapy in healthy term newborns with jaundice. Phototherapy should be instituted when the total serum bilirubin level is at or above 15 mg per dL (257 micromol per L) in infants 25 to 48 hours old, 18 mg per dL (308 micromol per L) in infants 49 to 72 hours old, and 20 mg per dL (342 micromol per L) in infants older than 72 hours. Few term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia have serious underlying pathology. Jaundice is considered pathologic if it presents within the first 24 hours after birth, the total serum bilirubin level rises by more than 5 mg per dL (86 micromol per L) per day or is higher than 17 mg per dL (290 micromol per L), or an infant has signs and symptoms suggestive of serious illness. The management goals are to exclude pathologic causes of hyperbilirubinemia and initiate treatment to prevent bilirubin neurotoxicity.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^40922a62]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy prescription key action statements — diagnostic testing and monitoring specify that total serum bilirubin (TSB) "should be used as the definitive diagnostic test used to guide all interventions," and that TSB "should be measured if the transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) reading is within 3.0 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold, if the TcB exceeds the phototherapy treatment threshold, or if the TcB is ≥ 15 mg/dL." When multiple measurements are available, the rate-of-rise can help detect hemolysis, with a rapid rise defined as " ≥ 0.3 mg/dL per hour in the first 24 hours or > 0.2 mg/dL per hour thereafter." For hospitalized infants, "TSB should be measured to verify efficacy after starting phototherapy," and timing "should be guided by the TSB trajectory (ie, rate of rise, mg per hour) and infant age." Clinicians "should evaluate the underlying cause or causes of hyperbilirubinemia," and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing "should be measured in any infant with jaundice of unknown cause whose TSB rises despite intensive phototherapy, whose TSB rises suddenly or rises after an initial decline, or who requires escalation of care."

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^c1f5fd50]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — background and risk factors — Cholestasis is defined as reduced bile formation or flow with retention of biliary substances, and cholestatic jaundice affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants; the most common causes in the first months of life are biliary atresia (BA) (25%–40%) and individually uncommon genetic disorders (25%). Parenteral nutrition (PN)-related cholestasis is present in up to one-fifth of neonates receiving PN for > 2 weeks, with longer duration of PN and intestinal failure described as independent risk factors; small for gestational age is an independent risk factor for neonatal cholestasis. The guideline notes it is not meant to address cholestasis in the preterm infant or PN, but close follow-up and serial measurements of fractionated bilirubin levels early in life are important, alongside monitoring growth and tolerance of enteral feedings. Persistent cholestasis in any infant should be considered hepatocellular in origin and all causes of cholestasis, including BA, should be ruled out in a timely fashion, and several studies demonstrate a higher incidence of BA in preterm infants compared with term infants with delayed diagnosis resulting in poorer outcome.

### Prevalence and burden of illness of treated hemolytic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a privately insured population in the United States [^1efe4200]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NHB), a common condition in newborn infants, results from elevated blood bilirubin levels. The excessive bilirubin manifests as yellowing of the skin and the normally white outer layer of the eyeballs. While most cases resolve quickly without intervention, NHB is a common reason for inpatient readmissions, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The prevalence of NHB is not precisely known, however, estimates suggest that approximately 50% full-term and 80% preterm newborns develop some form of NHB. High-risk NHB occurs in 8–9% of neonates during the first week after birth.

The origin of NHB may be physiologic or pathologic. Physiologic NHB may be caused by neonate immaturity and the resulting inability to cope with elevated levels of bilirubin. This benign form resolves itself in 2–3 weeks following birth, and usually without treatment. Pathologic NHB may be caused by hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), red blood cell (RBC) enzyme deficiency, or impaired bilirubin excretion. HDN results from incompatibilities between maternal and fetal blood types (Rh, ABO or a minor blood group), which may cause ruptures in fetal RBCs and elevated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic NHB usually appears within 24 h after birth.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guidelines address the assessment, screening, and treatment of NHB among infants at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. Risk assessment and treatment nomograms based on total serum bilirubin level, postnatal age in hours, and gestational age of the newborn with the presence or absence of risk factors are available to guide patient management. Similar guidelines are not available for neonates at less than 35 weeks of gestation because of scant evidence-based data, differences in clinical manifestations and unclear treatment outcomes.

When treatment is indicated, AAP guidelines recommend phototherapy as the initial treatment. In cases where bilirubin levels continue to increase despite phototherapy, the guidelines recommend adding exchange transfusion of whole blood to the treatment regimen, typically in the NICU. For hemolytic cases, AAP guidelines recommend the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as adjunctive therapy when bilirubin levels continue to rise despite intensive phototherapy. These challenges in management of high-risk hyperbilirubinemia substantially increase the urgency for safer and more effective screening and/or treatment options, especially when viewed against the knowledge that the permanent sequelae of kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSDs) might be prevented.

### The use of yes-associated protein expression in the diagnosis of persistent neonatal cholestatic liver disease [^68224b7a]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Although physiologic jaundice of neonates is common, persistent neonatal cholestasis is life-threatening and has multiple etiologies. Among these etiologies, biliary atresia (BA) requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. In diagnosing BA, the surgical pathologist must recognize subtle histologic changes, often with only a small core liver biopsy. To aid in the differential diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis, we investigated Yes-associated protein (YAP), a regulator of organ size and bile duct development. We examined whether a YAP immunostain can highlight emerging hepatobiliary epithelium in BA (n = 28) versus other causes of persistent cholestasis (non-BA; n = 15) and thus serve as a useful diagnostic marker in persistent neonatal jaundice. We show significantly (P < .01) more high-grade (< 2) fibrosis and ductular proliferation among BA versus non-BA cases. Likewise, there was significantly more high-grade (2–3/3) cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP staining in BA (97% and 89%) versus non-BA (20% and 13%). High-grade nuclear YAP staining was both sensitive (88%) and specific (87%) for the diagnosis of BA. In contrast to neonatal cholestasis, the differences in YAP localization in cholestatic/obstructed versus nonobstructed adult livers were not significant. Lastly, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of the YAP complex in both cholangiocyte and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines blocked compensatory bile duct proliferation, an early marker of BA that requires nuclear YAP expression, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In summary, we show that YAP expression modulates both bile duct proliferation and liver damage/fibrosis while acting as a sensitive and specific marker in the differential diagnosis of persistent neonatal cholestasis.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^20beac41]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level thus can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infant's age in hours. Because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability, infants at greatest risk are those who have increased bilirubin production rates, because of hemolysis, for example. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies as well as noninvasive technologies to treat and to identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates, respectively, are tantamount to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

### Universal bilirubin screening for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^157a929b]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

To reduce the incidence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia affecting newborns with jaundice in the United States and to prevent kernicterus, there is a need to implement proven prevention strategies for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia as recommended in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines for newborns > 35 weeks gestational age. The purpose of universal predischarge bilirubin screening is to identify infants with bilirubin levels > 75th percentile for age in hours and track those with rapid rates of bilirubin rise (> 0.2 mg per 100 mL per h). Early identification has been reported to predict severe hyperbilirubinemia and allow for evidence-based targeted interventions. A systems approach is likely to reduce the preventable causes of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. To do so, highest priority should be given to (i) designating extreme hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin > 427 μmol l(-1) or > 25 mg per 100 ml) as a reportable condition by laboratories and health-care providers through public health mandates; (ii) implementation of Joint Commission's Sentinel Report for kernicterus; (iii) nursing outreach to communities for education of prospective parents; (iv) development of clinical pathways to monitor, evaluate and track infants with extreme hyperbilirubinemia; and (v) societal awareness. These efforts should be monitored by a state and national surveillance system in order to critically improve the timeliness and completeness of notifications and to allow evaluation and interventions at the policy and individual family level.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 2 states that oral supplementation with water or dextrose water should not be provided to prevent hyperbilirubinemia or decrease bilirubin concentrations, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Strong Recommendation. Avoiding supplementation may help promote breastfeeding because supplementation has been associated with reduced maternal confidence in breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, and one study found no difference in peak serum bilirubin concentrations or the need for phototherapy among term breastfed newborn infants with physiologic jaundice by whether they were fed supplemental water. Another study of breastfed term infants whose weight was appropriate for gestational age found that supplementation with water or dextrose water was associated with higher bilirubin concentrations on day 6 after birth. There is no evidence of the benefit of routinely providing water or dextrose water supplementation and there are possible harms, including interference with breastfeeding, hyponatremia, and water intoxication, and there are no clear risks, harms, or costs associated with not routinely supplementing infants with water or dextrose water who are not receiving phototherapy.

Hyperbilirubinemia ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — scope and risk context: The gestational age cutoff of ≥ 35 weeks was chosen because it includes most newborn infants cared for in mother-baby units and well-baby nurseries, and this guideline does not apply to preterm newborns born < 35 weeks' gestation who generally receive care in neonatal intensive care units. Although rare in high-resource settings, kernicterus is deadly and leads to severe, lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors, and at some patient-specific threshold severe bilirubinemia can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. The current evidence base is insufficient to quantitatively derive the exact treatment threshold, but recent, large cohort investigations have provided reassurance that there are certain total serum bilirubin concentrations below which kernicterus or adverse effects are not observed.

### Rolling stones: an instructive case of neonatal cholestasis [^8a52c5c0]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jaundice within the first 1-2weeks of a neonate's life will generally self-resolve; however, if it lasts longer than this time frame it warrants further work up. Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can suggest neonatal cholestasis, which in turn reflects marked reduction in bile secretion and flow. The differential diagnosis for neonatal cholestasis is broad. Neonatal choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of neonatal cholestasis, but should be considered on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated conjugated bilirubin.

Case Presentation

We describe an infant who presented with neonatal cholestasis. He subsequently underwent work up for biliary atresia, as this is one of the more time-sensitive diagnoses that must be made in neonates with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. He was ultimately found to have choledocholithiasis on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. He was managed conservatively with optimizing nutrition and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.

Conclusions

We found that conservative management, specifically optimizing nutrition and treating with ursodeoxycholic acid, can be a sufficient approach to facilitating resolution of the choledocholithiasis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^69421633]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. The focus of this guideline is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. These guidelines provide a framework for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants of 35 or more weeks of gestation. In every infant, we recommend that clinicians 1) promote and support successful breastfeeding; 2) perform a systematic assessment before discharge for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia; 3) provide early and focused follow-up based on the risk assessment; and 4) when indicated, treat newborns with phototherapy or exchange transfusion to prevent the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia and, possibly, bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).

### Quantification of cephalocaudal progression of jaundice in preterm infants [^16c0cb34]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Jaundice in newborn infants is a common clinical condition. It affects up to 80% of preterm and 60% of the term newborn infants. Neonatal jaundice can potentially progress to severe hyperbilirubinemia, which may result in kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSDs) or bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND), causing irreversible brain damage. Timely treatment of jaundiced newborn infants with phototherapy can prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia and its neurological sequelae as well as the need for invasive treatment (e.g. blood exchange transfusion). Therefore, screening of newborn infants at risk for hyperbilirubinemia is important and advised in guidelines. Transcutaneous bilirubinometry (TcB) is an effective non-invasive method for screening hyperbilirubinemia and it can reduce the number of invasive total serum bilirubin (TSB) determinations, which is currently considered the golden standard. –

The yellow skin discoloration associated with neonatal jaundice is often first observed at the face and only later in the extremities. This phenomenon is known as the cephalocaudal progression (CCP) of jaundice. The physiological causes and spatiotemporal dependency of CCP are still not fully understood. More insight into this phenomenon can improve our in-depth understanding of the progression and diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia. From a more practical point of view, it is important to understand the influence of CCP on the correlation between the TcB and TSB. Current transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) meters are designed for forehead and/or sternum measurements. However, measurements on other body locations are gaining popularity, e.g. on the interscapular site to avoid the influence of ambient lightand at the hipbone underneath the diaper to reduce the influence of photototherapy.CCP potentially influences the reliability of the TcB at these non-standard body locations.

### Model-based characterization of total serum bilirubin dynamics in preterm infants [^44cf8a80]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperbilirubinemia affects 60–80% of newborns. Elevated unconjugated bilirubin induces neurologic dysfunction by depositing in selective brain regions including the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and brainstem nuclei. Hyperbilirubinemia can manifest as acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) shortly after birth, presenting with non-specific clinical manifestations such as lethargy, hypotonia, poor feeding, recurrent apnea, and desaturations. – Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE) may ensue, known as kernicterus, causing permanent neurologic sequelae such as athetoid palsy and dystonia, hearing loss, and oculomotor impairments. Particularly, premature infants born before 32 weeks of gestation are especially vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of hyperbilirubinemia, which can be more severe and long-lasting.

The management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is guided by protocols from organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), with adaptions in national standards across different countries and regions. – Research efforts have primarily focused on the early postnatal evolution of total serum bilirubin (TSB) within the first 72 or 96 h of life, – with less attention given to the prolonged course in preterm (28–32 weeks of gestation) and extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks of gestation), who are more likely to face potentially life-threatening conditions.

The ability of preterm infants to metabolize and excrete bilirubin matures as aging after birth. After the period of physiological neonatal jaundice (usually one week after birth), as the liver matures, its ability to metabolize bilirubin improves, leading to a progressive reduction in the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. An important aspect of the metabolic pathway of bilirubin excretion is the bilirubin conjugating capacity of the liver, mediated by hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. This enzyme activity is less than 1% of adult values during the fetal and early neonatal period and then begins to increase at an exponential rate until it reaches the adult value by 14 weeks of age, after which it remains constant.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^89c4f748]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants — KAS 8 notes that if appropriate follow-up cannot be arranged for an infant recommended to have an outpatient follow-up bilirubin measure, discharge may be delayed (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade D, Option). Follow-up after discharge for some families can be challenging and potentially contribute to missing the opportunity for timely treatment of hyperbilirubinemia, whereas delay in discharge can be difficult for families and increase nursery-related expenses. The balance of benefit and harm depend on the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and the challenge of follow-up, and extending access for newborn follow-up can reduce the need to delay discharge; shared decision making can help inform the benefit-harm assessment.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to exchange transfusion, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to perform an urgent exchange transfusion in infants with a total serum bilirubin level at or above the exchange transfusion threshold. Consider deferring the exchange transfusion while continuing intensive phototherapy if, while preparing for but before starting the exchange transfusion, a total serum bilirubin concentration is below the exchange transfusion threshold and the infant does not show signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, and following the total serum bilirubin every 2 hours until the total serum bilirubin is below the escalation-of-care threshold.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^3a9f0ff1]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Suboptimal intake jaundice of the newborn — early feeding volumes, timing, and bilirubin dynamics: In the first 24 hours of life, exclusively breastfed infants may receive no more than 1–5 mL of milk per feeding or 5–37 mL in total; normal early stomach capacity is 27 mL per feeding or about 150 mL/day, and maternal secretory activation occurs around 2–5 days of age. Strong evidence suggests that increased serum bilirubin in the first few days is highly correlated with suboptimal enteral intake. Early onset jaundice occurring within 24–48 hours of birth is unlikely to be related to breastfeeding and should be assessed and treated promptly without interruption of breastfeeding. In a normal adult, even 24 hours without caloric intake results in a small increase in unconjugated bilirubin of about 17–34 μmol/L (1–2 mg/dL), an effect due to an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin.

### Rare cause of jaundice in a term newborn [^826450a6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is a frequently observed occurrence in full-term newborns and typically manifests between 48 and 96 hours following birth. Early-onset jaundice is primarily induced by pathological factors, namely sepsis, hemolysis and an excessive accumulation of bilirubin resulting from the breakdown of red blood cells. We present a case involving a full-term newborn with an uneventful perinatal history, who exhibited jaundice within the initial day of life and was subsequently admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit to commence intensive phototherapy. Initial screenings for sepsis and blood group incompatibility yielded negative results. However, despite 6hours of phototherapy, the bilirubin levels did not decrease, prompting an investigation into central nervous system haemorrhage, which uncovered the presence of a haemorrhagic stroke. After a worsening in neurological status with neonatal crisis and need for phenobarbital, a life-saving craniotomy was performed. Clinical evolution was good with no additional crisis detected after the early neonatal period and improvement in motor function at 2-month-old follow-up.

To address systems failures and promote a safer management of newborn jaundice, we propose an 'aviation safety standard' for newborn health-care services during the first week after birth. Systems failure in newborn jaundice management has been characterized by lapses in concern, loss of continuity, and delays in care by multiple providers at multiple sites. Components for a six-step national strategy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and possibly kernicterus are being implemented as delineated in the 2004 AAP guidelines. The clinical guidelines for safer and evidence-based practice have been characterized by both healthcare and societal communities. Professional and community organizations are optimizing outreach resources and facilitating institutionalization of these practices. Nationwide implementation at individual birthing hospitals concurrent with surveillance feedback needs to be initiated. Implementation of a 'six-sigma' approach, as proposed to the current Center for Disease Control and Prevention-initiated partnership (health-care providers, public health and community advocates) may be achieved through collaboration with state and national agencies.

### Jaundice and breastfeeding… [^e339ac8d]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

About jaundice Jaundice is a sign of elevated bilirubin levels. It is common during the first weeks of a child's life, especially among preterm newborns. Bilirubin is a product from the normal breakdown of red blood cells. It is elevated in newborns because they:

- Have a higher rate of bilirubin production than adults. This is due to their shorter lifespan of red blood cells and higher red blood cell concentration.
- Have immature liver function, leading to a slower metabolism of bilirubin.
- May have a delay in the passage of meconium, leading to increased reabsorption of bilirubin in the intestines. In most newborns, jaundice is termed "physiologic jaundice" and is considered harmless. Types of jaundice and therapy Suboptimal intake jaundice, also called breastfeeding jaundice, most often occurs in the first week of life when breastfeeding is being established.

Newborns may not receive optimal milk intake. This leads to elevated bilirubin levels due to increased reabsorption of bilirubin in the intestines. Inadequate milk intake also delays the passage of meconium. Meconium contains large amounts of bilirubin that is then transferred into the infant's circulation. In most cases, breastfeeding can, and should, continue. More feedings can reduce the risk of jaundice. Breast milk jaundice most often occurs in the second or later weeks of life and can continue for several weeks. The exact mechanism leading to breast milk jaundice is unknown. Some believe that substances in the mother's milk may inhibit the ability of the infant's liver to process bilirubin. Phototherapy is a common treatment for jaundice. Other therapeutic options include temporary additional feeding with mother's expressed breast milk, donor human milk, or infant formula. Rare occasions might require temporary interruption of breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding and jaundice Most newborns with jaundice can breastfeed More frequent breastfeeding can improve the mother's milk supply. This can also improve the infant's caloric intake and hydration, thus reducing elevated bilirubin. In rare cases, infants may benefit from interrupting breastfeeding for 12 to 48 hours. 1, 2 Replacement feeding during this limited time can help diagnose breast milk jaundice.

Treatment at these levels may prevent kernicterus, and risks of exchange transfusion include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^cdcaca9d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Any infant who is jaundiced beyond two to three weeks of life should be evaluated for neonatal cholestasis. Neonatal cholestasis is defined as accumulation of bile substances in blood due to impaired excretion. These infants should always have fractionated serum bilirubin levels checked to differentiate the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia of cholestasis from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is usually benign and spontaneously resolves. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, pale stools and dark urine are the cardinal features of neonatal cholestasis. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive and a systematic approach is helpful to quickly establish the diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis and affected infants need surgery before 60 days of life for better prognosis. Premature infants have multifactorial cholestasis and need a modified approach to the evaluation of cholestasis. Management of cholestasis is mostly supportive, consisting of medical management of complications of chronic cholestasis like pruritus and nutritional support for malabsorption and vitamin deficiency.

Measures

All aetiologies of jaundice beyond physiologic and breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice are considered pathologic. Features of pathologic jaundice include the appearance of jaundice within 24 h after birth, a total serum bilirubin level higher than 15 mg/dl (256 μmol/L) in preterm newborns and 20 mg/dl (340 μmol/L) in term babies. Others include rise of unconjugated bilirubin by ≥ 5 mg/dl (85 μmol/L) in 24 h, prolonged jaundice, elevation of the serum conjugated bilirubin level to ≥ 2 mg/dl (34 μmol/L) and jaundice with evidence of underlying illnesses such as haemolytic conditions, sepsis, liver pathology etc.

Overview of management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia in NICU of ESUTH

Neonatal jaundice occurring after the 2nd day of life in otherwise healthy babies without other symptoms is sent for urgent serum bilirubin estimation to guide further clinical action. As part of the unit protocols, immediate admission is indicated in jaundice occurring in the 1st of life, levels indicative of pathological jaundice (see above), in preterm, in all sick babies and those with identified risk for bilirubin encephalopathy.

After admission, a thorough history is taken documenting the onset and progress of jaundice, duration, gestational age of the baby at delivery and associated symptoms that signifies imminent risk of encephalopathy such as vomiting, refusal to suckle, weakness, abnormal movements, shrill cry, abnormal breathing etc.

A comprehensive physical examination is also done noting the anatomical level of the jaundice, activity of baby, presence of pallor, vital signs and thorough neurological assessment noting the posture, movement, cry, muscle tone and status of the primitive reflexes. Concurrently, basic laboratory investigations to estimate bilirubin level and identify possible causes are done. These tests include; serum bilirubin level (total and direct), haemoglobin level, random blood sugar, maternal and baby's blood group and rhesus status, G6PD status for males, blood film for malaria parasite and size/shape of the erythrocyte. Further investigations such as blood culture, serum protein coomb's test, serum electrolyte, urine and stool analysis, abdominal ultrasonography and blood gas are also ordered based on the findings in the history, physical examinations and initial laboratory tests.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^b7670a46]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Clinical experience suggests increased incidences of neonatal jaundice when air quality worsens, yet no studies have quantified this relationship. Here we reports investigations in 25,782 newborns showing an increase in newborn's bilirubin levels, the indicator of neonatal jaundice risk, by 0.076 (95% CI: 0.027–0.125), 0.029 (0.014–0.044) and 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002–0.016) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for PM 2.5 exposure in the concentration ranges of 10–35, 35–75 and 75–200 μg/m 3, respectively. The response is 0.094 (0.077–0.111) and 0.161 (0.07–0.252) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for SO 2 exposure at 10–15 and above 15 μg/m 3, respectively, and 0.351 (0.314–0.388) mg/dL per mg/m 3 for CO exposure. Bilirubin levels increase linearly with exposure time between 0 and 48 h. Positive relationship between maternal exposure and newborn bilirubin level is also quantitated. The jaundice−pollution relationship is not affected by top-of-atmosphere incident solar irradiance and atmospheric visibility. Improving air quality may therefore be key to lowering the neonatal jaundice risk.

### Care practices and traditional beliefs related to neonatal jaundice in Northern Vietnam: a population-based, cross-sectional descriptive study [^6685a595]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Although we were unable to determine the population incidence of hyperbilirubinemia, our study, nevertheless, contributes to understanding of perceptions of jaundice, care-seeking behavior for jaundice, and barriers to care. Our data could be used to develop educational interventions to dispel myths and improve care-seeking. Traditional, non-medical beliefs about the causes of jaundice and the use of traditional remedies in lieu of care-seeking were prevalent. Some mothers believed cranial suture diastases could cause jaundice and would treat the diastases and jaundice with an herb (typically burning the "ngai" herb and exposing the infant to the ashes or smoke). The association between jaundice and cranial suture diastasis may have arisen due to both being caused by intracranial hemorrhage which is frequent in Vietnam due to lack of vitamin K prophylaxis. Others believed jaundice was caused by "lanh". These lesions reportedly developed after the first few days of life and were believed to be associated with jaundice and poor feeding. Mothers said that jaundice would resolve and feeding improve after they scraped off the "lanh". The perceived association between the improvement in jaundice with treatment of cranial suture diastasis or removal of "lanh" may just be a coincidental temporal relationship with the peaking of physiologic jaundice at 3–5 days before spontaneous resolution. However, for those cases that progress to pathologic hyperbilirubinemia, these traditional practices may have caused false reassurance, contribute to decreased or delayed care-seeking, and may contribute to increased risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia. The common and widespread use of traditional medicine, including herbal therapies for jaundice, has been previously reported in northern Vietnam and suggests that such therapies competed with evidence-based treatments. Traditional medicine in the newborn also has been described across many cultures, sometimes causing harm, delaying care-seeking, or increasing bilirubin admission levels.

Total adherence score and proportion of jaundice protocol items adhered to before and during intervention implementation

a There were 2290 and 4440 deliveries in the intervention and control arm respectively in the pre-trial period

b There were 2494 and 5425 deliveries in the intervention and control arm respectively in the trial period

The number of jaundiced neonates decreased to 1.6 per 1000 deliveries in the intervention arm and increased to 9.2 per 1000 deliveries in the control arm during the intervention period. These jaundiced neonates were on average 5.1 days (SD = 4.5 days) old at the time of the diagnosis. The 10th and 90th percentile for adherence per theme for jaundice protocol varied from 0% to 100% in intervention arm and 14.3% to 100% in the control arm. In the intervention arm, the mean score for total adherence to jaundice protocols was 39.3% (SD = 27.7%); in the control arm it was 64.6% (SD = 8.2%). In 45 (83.3%) of all cases of jaundice, the cause of the jaundice was classified 'unknown'. One case of physiological jaundice and one case of pathological jaundice were identified in the intervention arm, while one case of cord sepsis and one case of physiological jaundice were identified in the control arm; for the rest of the cases, the cause of the jaundice was not stated in any of the records found in the health facilities. There was no documentation of treatment (using phototherapy or by sun-bathing) of three neonates in the intervention clusters. In the control clusters, all jaundiced neonates received either of the aforementioned treatment options. All sunbathed neonates were followed up during the intervention period. All jaundiced neonates received antibiotics as part of their treatment although only one case of infection (cord sepsis) was identified as a cause of jaundice.

Overall, adherence status was low to moderate during the pre-intervention and intervention periods (Fig. 1). The 57.2% improvement in adherence to jaundice protocols observed in the intervention clusters (Fig. 2) was not significant (p -value = 0.38) while improvement observed in the control clusters (43.2%) was significant (p -value < 0.001). Comparing the two study arms, control clusters scored higher in adherence to jaundice protocols before and during the intervention period (p -value = 0.005 and 0.088 respectively).

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^25d34e85]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors," adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care."

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^113e9581]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a clinically relevant population of disease-free neonates referred with prolonged jaundice, we found the 95th centile for direct bilirubin decreased slowly with age but was approximately 25 µmol/L. Failure for direct bilirubin to decrease with time at an individual level is particularly concerning. In contrast, the direct–total bilirubin ratio was highly variable and hence an unreliable indicator of pathology. While we acknowledge our data do not include any patients with liver disease, they nonetheless provide support for the NICE recommendation that well neonates with prolonged jaundice do not require investigation for liver disease if the conjugated bilirubin is ≤ 25 µmol/L. This threshold has the merits of simplicity and a high margin of safety; however, compared with other more stringent criteria, it may result in more neonates being extensively investigated with negligible gain in sensitivity.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline KAS 25 — discharge education and follow-up are specified as follows: Before discharge, all families should receive written and verbal education about neonatal jaundice, and parents should be provided written information to facilitate postdischarge care, including the date, time, and place of the follow-up appointment and, when necessary, a prescription and appointment for a follow-up transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) or total serum bilirubin (TSB). Birth hospitalization information, including the last TcB or TSB and the age at which it was measured, and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) results (if any) should be transmitted to the primary care provider who will see the infant at follow-up, and if there is uncertainty about who will provide the follow-up care, this information should also be provided to families (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation). Education should include an explanation of jaundice; the need to monitor infants for jaundice, dehydration, and lethargy; signs of ineffective feeding, fussiness, and illness; and an assessment of understanding of these issues and the recommended follow-up. Implementation of systems to provide consistent application of these recommendations for all infants 35 or more weeks of gestation within mother-baby units, hospitals, and primary care clinics is critical to the success of these recommendations, and a system should be in place to provide care whenever there is uncertainty regarding the provision of appropriate follow-up.

Hyperbilirubinemia — visual assessment, estimation accuracy, and early testing (KAS 4): KAS 4 states, "All infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at least every 12 hours following delivery until discharge. TSB or TcB should be measured as soon as possible for infants noted to be jaundiced < 24 hours after birth. (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation)." Visual estimation studies show differences as great as 13 to 15 mg/dL between the actual TSB or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and estimated values; however, if the infant is not jaundiced at all or the clinician's visual bilirubin estimate is < 5 mg/dL, a TSB ≥ 12 mg/dL is highly unlikely. Visual estimation is routinely used to guide decisions about obtaining TcB or TSB in term-born outpatients 3 or more days old, but all infants should have at least 1 TcB or TSB measured.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^ed172a72]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Most neonates are affected by jaundice in their first days of life, caused by accumulation of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia). While this condition occurs to some degree in 50–90% of births, usually it resolves without treatment. Phototherapy is used in more serious cases, around 5–10% of newborns, and can be effective. Yet, severe cases of jaundice still occur — leading to neurotoxicity, long-term cognitive impairment, and in rare cases kernicterus and death — and cause a significant burden on global health –.

Many questions about the etiology of neonatal jaundice remain, although the core biochemistry of bilirubin metabolism is known. Bilirubin (unconjugated form) is produced in the breakdown of hemoglobin, then taken up into hepatocytes, and converted to conjugated bilirubin by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Conjugated bilirubin is transported to bile, while hopping in and out of hepatocytes to prevent local accumulation, then travels to intestines for excretion via feces. In neonates, liver UGT expression is low, while the production of unconjugated bilirubin is high (because of faster turnover of red blood cells and fetal hemoglobin), leading to its accumulation. Likely, neonates also differ in activity of other enzymes, such as uptake into the liver, transporters, and excretion mechanisms, contributing to the bilirubin imbalance, but these factors have only begun to be explored.

It is not clear why in some newborns this imbalance is more severe, and clinical presentation worse. Bilirubin accumulation is more pronounced in preterm newborns, reportedly because the relevant metabolic pathways are not yet matured, although the specifics of this are not yet established. Some rare pathological factors with clear mechanisms are known, such as hemolysis due to ABO or Rhesus incompatibilityand highly deleterious mutations in UGT1A1 or transporter genes. Genetic variants may also modify the effects of environmental factors, such as breastfeeding. However, genetic studies of neonatal jaundice to date have been limited to only established candidate genes, and have often produced conflicting results even for the same variants. Most of the genetic basis, and in particular common variants or other, non-UGT genes, remains largely unexplored. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could fill in these gaps by discovering new variants or genes associated with neonatal jaundice, as well as clarifying the importance of different known metabolic pathways in newborns, ultimately leading to better identification of risk cases or new treatment strategies.

Given the high proportion of neonates requiring phototherapy and the absence of follow-up data on neurodevelopmental outcomes, future prospective studies are essential to evaluate the long-term effects of neonatal jaundice and the effectiveness of culturally appropriate resource-sensitive interventions. The inclusion of neonates aged 1–6 days introduces inherent variability in bilirubin levels due to physiological transitions during this period. While physicians incorporated age in the assessment of jaundice, the lack of precise hour-specific data was a limitation of our retrospective design. Prospective studies employing rigorous hour-based nomograms could refine risk assessment.

The strengths of this study include its case-control design and focus on an under-researched geographic area. However, limitations include reliance on maternal recall and medical records, and the absence of data on maternal drug administration during labor, anesthesia type, umbilical cord management, or G6PD status. Future studies should incorporate these variables to comprehensively assess their effects on neonatal jaundice. Overall, this study provides crucial data specific to Somaliland. These findings can inform the development of targeted screening and management protocols tailored to the unique challenges and resources of this setting, potentially improving outcomes for newborns at risk of jaundice.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^52a07a09]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Clinical experience suggests increased incidences of neonatal jaundice when air quality worsens, yet no studies have quantified this relationship. Here we reports investigations in 25,782 newborns showing an increase in newborn's bilirubin levels, the indicator of neonatal jaundice risk, by 0.076 (95% CI: 0.027–0.125), 0.029 (0.014–0.044) and 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002–0.016) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for PM 2.5 exposure in the concentration ranges of 10–35, 35–75 and 75–200μg/m 3, respectively. The response is 0.094 (0.077–0.111) and 0.161 (0.07–0.252) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for SO 2 exposure at 10–15 and above 15μg/m 3, respectively, and 0.351 (0.314–0.388) mg/dL per mg/m 3 for CO exposure. Bilirubin levels increase linearly with exposure time between 0 and 48h. Positive relationship between maternal exposure and newborn bilirubin level is also quantitated. The jaundice-pollution relationship is not affected by top-of-atmosphere incident solar irradiance and atmospheric visibility. Improving air quality may therefore be key to lowering the neonatal jaundice risk.

### Risk factors for readmission for phototherapy due to jaundice in healthy newborns: a retrospective, observational study [^2daeebb5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postnatal hospital stay in many developed countries has been decreasing over the past few decades. In Israel, the national health insurance covers a hospital stay of 48 h after an uneventful vaginal birth and a stay of 3 days after an uncomplicated caesarean delivery as the accepted length of stay (LOS) for mothers and infants. A similar trend was observed in a Canadian study that evaluated close to 2 million live births and found that approximately 47% of mother-infant dyads were hospitalized for 1 day following a vaginal birth and that approximately 49% were hospitalized for 3 days following a caesarean delivery. While there are many benefits to early discharge, including cost reduction, higher availability of hospital beds for other mothers, and reduced risk for nosocomial infections to mothers and infants, there are also specific risks associated with premature discharge, even of healthy infants, with hyperbilirubinemia being chief among them. Physiological jaundice typically appears in over 80% of newborn babies. It develops between the second and fourth day of life and peaks between the fourth and fifth day, thus, under current practices, it is most likely to peak after the neonate has left the hospital.

A recent study conducted in the UK analyzed over 4 million live births and reported a readmission rate for neonatal jaundice of 5.2%. A Canadian study observed that 4.2% of infants following a vaginal birth and 2.2% following a caesarean delivery were readmitted for neonatal jaundice. The findings of analyses that compared length of postnatal stay and readmission for neonatal jaundice have been inconclusive, however, the correlation appeared to be stronger for term infants than for late preterm infants. Guidelines issued in 2004 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and updated in 2009 on the follow-up and management of infants post-discharge recommended a visit at a healthcare provider within 48 h from discharge. The Israeli guidelines on hyperbilirubinemia management also include a recommendation for all infants to be seen by a healthcare professional within 2–3 days post-discharge, irrespective of total serum bilirubin levels at discharge and the presence or absence of risk factors for developing severe hyperbilirubinemia. Accordingly, several reports suggested that implementation of universal postnatal screening for hyperbilirubinemia within 48 h from discharge might decrease hospital readmission rates due to neonatal jaundice. However, it was our impression that there were additional factors that increased the risk for jaundice-related readmission. The aim of the present study was to identify those risk factors.

### Factors associated with neonatal jaundice among neonates admitted to three hospitals in burao, somaliland: a facility-based unmatched case-control study [^9c59de7f]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal jaundice refers to yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes resulting from the deposition of bilirubin in body tissues. In adults and older children, hyperbilirubinemia is typically defined by a serum bilirubin concentration exceeding 1.5 mg/dL. However, owing to the physiological transition processes occurring after birth, neonates frequently exhibit higher bilirubin levels, with jaundice becoming clinically apparent when total serum bilirubin reaches approximately 5 mg/dL. This transitional hyperbilirubinemia is often benign, yet under certain circumstances, it may progress to pathological levels that pose a significant risk of acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus.

The global burden of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia remains substantial, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. An estimated 1.1 million infants worldwide develop severe hyperbilirubinemia annually, with neonatal jaundice ranking among the top ten causes of neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Beyond mortality, untreated or inadequately managed jaundice contributes substantially to long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, compounding the societal and economic impacts in resource-limited settings. In Somaliland, preliminary reports indicate that up to 30% of neonatal hospital admissions are due to jaundice, which contributes to approximately 20% of all neonatal deaths in the region.

In Somaliland neonatal jaundice is a frequent cause of hospital admission. However, this region faces distinct challenges that may shape both the risk factors and outcomes associated with neonatal jaundice. Widespread home deliveries, limited availability of neonatal intensive care and phototherapy units, cultural reliance on traditional postpartum care practices, and under-resourced referral systems influence the early identification and management of affected neonates. These factors can potentially exacerbate the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia and its complications. Moreover, Somaliland's predominantly pastoralist population is subject to unique nutritional and environmental exposures, which may contribute to conditions such as low birth weight or dehydration, further influencing the risk of jaundice. Existing health inequities, reflected in disparities in maternal education, rural residence, and healthcare accessibility, may also impact timely care seeking and outcomes for jaundiced newborns.
