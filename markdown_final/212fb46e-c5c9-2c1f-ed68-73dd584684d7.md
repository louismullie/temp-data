## Question

when elevated total cholesterol indicate treatment with statin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when elevated total cholesterol indicates treatment with a statin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether total cholesterol meaningfully informs statin decisions or if LDL-C is the primary driver. Then, I should verify the major guideline categories that trigger statin therapy. Next, I will translate those categories into practical thresholds and intensities. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk enhancers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer and double-check for any exceptions where total cholesterol might still matter.

> Let me first confirm the clinical principle: total cholesterol is a crude marker and statin decisions are driven by LDL-C, non-HDL-C, diabetes, clinical ASCVD, and calculated 10-year ASCVD risk, not by total cholesterol alone. I should double-check that contemporary guidelines de-emphasize total cholesterol for treatment decisions, which they do, focusing instead on LDL-C and risk-based indications [^0fdc680a] [^88dbcf29].

> Next, I should review the four main groups where statins are indicated regardless of total cholesterol. Hold on, let me verify the exact wording: adults with clinical ASCVD, adults 20–75 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, adults 40–75 years with diabetes, and adults 40–75 years without diabetes who have LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. These are the core ACC/AHA categories and they do not hinge on total cholesterol values [^0fdc680a] [^93e442d2].

> I will now examine the LDL-C thresholds and intensities. For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, high-intensity statin is recommended in adults 20–75 years. For diabetes ages 40–75, moderate-intensity statin is indicated, with high-intensity reasonable if multiple risk factors are present. For primary prevention without diabetes, moderate-intensity is advised when 10-year risk is 7.5–19.9%, and high-intensity when risk is ≥ 20%. Wait, I should confirm the percent-reduction goals: intermediate risk aims for ≥ 30% LDL-C reduction, high risk for ≥ 50%, which aligns with the 2018–2019 ACC/AHA guidance [^0fdc680a] [^88dbcf29].

> But wait, what if total cholesterol is high and LDL-C is not? I need to check whether non-HDL-C ever changes the decision. Non-HDL-C is a secondary target and can refine risk, especially in diabetes or when triglycerides are elevated; some guidelines and pathways incorporate non-HDL-C thresholds for intensification, though ACC/AHA primarily uses percent LDL-C reduction. So, while total cholesterol itself is not a treatment trigger, a high total cholesterol often tracks with higher LDL-C or non-HDL-C, which can support statin use in the appropriate risk context [^3434cc43] [^0fdc680a].

> Let me consider special populations and risk enhancers. In adults 20–39, very high LDL-C (≥ 190 mg/dL) warrants statin therapy, and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL with family history is reasonable to treat. In adults > 75, decisions should be individualized via clinician–patient discussion. Risk enhancers such as premature ASCVD family history, LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL, elevated Lp(a), chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, or inflammatory disorders can justify statin initiation at borderline or intermediate risk. I should confirm that CAC scoring can reclassify risk: CAC = 0 allows deferral in many, whereas CAC ≥ 100 strongly supports statin therapy [^d562e8a0] [^db656f16] [^23a6256f].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of triglycerides and when they change statin decisions. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia (nonfasting ≥ 175 mg/dL) functions as a risk enhancer in primary prevention and can support moderate-intensity statin at intermediate risk; however, statins are not first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/dL), where triglyceride-specific therapy is prioritized. This nuance matters when total cholesterol is high due to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins rather than LDL-C [^60ae4690] [^b123e085].

> I should double-check the bottom line so I don't overstate anything. Elevated total cholesterol alone does not indicate statin therapy; statins are indicated when LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, when diabetes is present in adults 40–75, when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, or when clinical ASCVD is present. In these scenarios, total cholesterol may be elevated, but the decision rests on LDL-C, diabetes, calculated risk, or established disease, not on total cholesterol per se [^0fdc680a] [^93e442d2].

Treat with a statin when **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^0fdc680a] or when **10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%** [^d76c7231] and LDL-C is 70–189 mg/dL [^0fdc680a]. Also initiate statins for **diabetes in adults 40–75 years** [^0fdc680a] and for **clinical ASCVD** [^028d106c]. Total cholesterol is not used to decide statin therapy; focus on LDL-C, risk factors, and ASCVD risk [^0fdc680a]. Use moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention and high-intensity for secondary prevention or very high LDL-C [^0fdc680a] [^c0d53b42].

## Clinical guidelines for statin therapy

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provide clear recommendations for statin therapy based on LDL-C levels, clinical ASCVD status, diabetes, and calculated 10-year ASCVD risk [^0fdc680a] [^d76c7231]. Total cholesterol is not a primary determinant for statin initiation [^0fdc680a].

### Indications for statin therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for statin therapy** |
|-|-|
| LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) | High-intensity statin therapy recommended for adults aged 20–75 years [^0fdc680a] |
| Clinical ASCVD (e.g. coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease) | High-intensity statin therapy recommended for adults aged ≤ 75 years [^028d106c] |
| Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) in adults aged 40–75 years | Moderate-intensity statin therapy recommended [^0fdc680a] |
| LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL (1.8–4.9 mmol/L) and 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% | Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy recommended after clinician–patient risk discussion [^0fdc680a] |

### Role of total cholesterol

Total cholesterol is a general measure of lipid status but is **not used to guide statin initiation** [^0fdc680a]. Decisions are based on LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and clinical risk factors rather than total cholesterol alone [^0fdc680a].

---

## Risk assessment tools

The ACC/AHA recommends using the **Pooled Cohort Equations** to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk [^0fdc680a]. This tool incorporates age, sex, race, total cholesterol, HDL-C, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive treatment, diabetes, and smoking status [^0fdc680a]. Patients with a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% are considered for statin therapy if LDL-C is 70–189 mg/dL [^0fdc680a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Age**: Adults > 75 years require individualized assessment and shared decision-making for statin initiation [^0fdc680a].
- **Statin intolerance**: Alternative therapies (e.g. ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) may be considered for patients unable to tolerate statins [^c81ba940].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, exercise, and weight management are recommended alongside statin therapy [^56fc61b1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: High-intensity statin therapy recommended [^0fdc680a].
- **Clinical ASCVD**: High-intensity statin therapy recommended for adults ≤ 75 years [^028d106c].
- **Diabetes mellitus (age 40–75)**: Moderate-intensity statin therapy recommended [^0fdc680a].
- **LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%**: Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy recommended after risk discussion [^0fdc680a].

---

Total cholesterol alone **does not dictate statin therapy**; decisions should be based on LDL-C, clinical ASCVD status, diabetes, and calculated 10-year ASCVD risk [^0fdc680a].

### Statins for all? [^e360cd1a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^6e8e728a]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^93986ea3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.

High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% and risk-enhancing factors start or intensify statin therapy. If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older.

If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and statin use among U.S. adults with intermediate 10-year predicted ASCVD risk [^e11f4908]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

While HDL-C is considered in the pooled cohort equation to calculate 10-year ASCVD risk, it is not recommended as an ASCVD risk factor or risk enhancer. Furthermore, adults with either low or high HDL-C may actually be at increased risk of an ASCVD event. In contrast, the current analysis shows that adults with an HDL-C above the normal range may be treated less aggressively with statin medication, despite a similar ASCVD risk. The role of HDL-C in ASCVD is an active area of research, yet the simplified view of HDL-C as "good cholesterol" is both inaccurate and potentially misleading. When considering statin use, it behooves clinicians and patients not to use high HDL-C as a "protective" factor to justify withholding appropriate statin therapy when indicated. Future analyses should focus on alternative lipid markers, such as total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and lipoprotein(a), to assess guideline-concordant statin utilization. Better understanding how clinicians and patients use HDL-C to influence decision-making may be important to improving statin use among indicated adults.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f8e2207]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations — patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^26480d9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^513386b5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^935393ac]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association patient-centered dyslipidemia management emphasizes that an elevated level of atherogenic cholesterol is a root cause of atherosclerosis and that reducing elevated levels will lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; when lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality, and non-lipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed. Care should follow a patient-centered approach in which the initial step is a determination of the patient's risk for an ASCVD event and the patient should be an active participant in shared decision making. Lifestyle counseling is a key element, and if lifestyle therapies are insufficient to achieve desired atherogenic cholesterol levels, evidence-based drug therapy, particularly moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered; if goal levels are not achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, combining a statin with a second (and sometimes a third) agent may be considered for selected patients. Alternative strategies may be needed for patients who are statin intolerant or who prefer not to use statin therapy, and regular patient and lipid follow-up is warranted; treatment goals and periodic monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels are important tools. The scope of these recommendations also includes lifestyle therapies, groups with special considerations (children and adolescents, women, older patients, certain ethnic and racial groups, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with residual risk despite statin and lifestyle therapies), and strategies to improve patient outcomes by increasing adherence and using team-based collaborative care.

Statin therapy indications — statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician-patient risk discussion.

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^711bb727]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^0791e886]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^6c6544bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^853a9ff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^9f2693bc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Optimizing lipid management in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^94254958]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

According to the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dL should be discharged on lipid-lowering therapy. When LDL cholesterol levels are between 100 and 129 mg/dL, evaluation of ratios of LDL cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol may provide additional insight into a patient's risk status. Patients who were using statin therapy before admission for an acute coronary syndrome should be continued on lipid-lowering therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2002 guideline update for management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction recommends statin therapy at discharge as a class I indication, level of evidence A. Furthermore, studies confirm that statin therapy begun early during hospitalization can prevent ischemic events in patients who are treated by an invasive strategy and those who are treated only by a medical strategy. However, studies suggest that patient compliance with a statin regimen after discharge is far from optimal. There are 2 programs available to help ensure that appropriate patients receive and continue taking lipid-lowering therapy. These programs are the Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) and the Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP).

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Are treatment targets for hypercholesterolemia evidence based? Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^079e0b8b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Search for evidence supporting target age, level of intervention and target values for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in children with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL and Cochrane Reviews databases from 1966 to 2007 were searched for articles reporting statin therapy in children and adolescents aged 8–18 years. Retrieved articles were screened for double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Results

Seven trials involving 884 patients met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis findings showed significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 were significantly increased by statin therapy. Evidence on target level in children was limited to one study attainment of LDL cholesterol treatment target in 60% of the subjects in the treatment group and none in the placebo group reached their target LDL cholesterol. Evidence on the effect of statins on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis was limited to two studies (one RCT on the effect upon the carotid intima-media thickness (n = 211; mean difference (MD) -0.01; 95% CI -0.03 to -0.00), and one showing that the mean absolute change in flow-mediated dilation after 28 weeks of statin treatment was significantly higher in the simvastatin group compared to placebo group (MD 2.7%; 95% CI 0.42 to 4.98).

Conclusions

There is no firm evidence regarding when to start statin treatment or what target LDL cholesterol level should be attained. Recent recommendations that favour statins as the first-line drug treatment for hypercholesterolemia are evidence based. Studying high-risk groups (obese or diabetic patients) and incorporating composite end points may help define treatment guidelines.

### Cholesterol, not just cardiovascular risk, is important in deciding who should receive statin treatment [^83b8a894]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins, including the most recent, fail to make the best use of the evidence from clinical trials by concentrating on absolute CVD risk as a statin indication and not also considering that a major determinant of therapeutic benefit is the magnitude of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achieved. This decrease is proportional to the pretreatment concentration. We set out to apply this knowledge to the calculation of the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNT) and to assess critically how current guidelines performed at different degrees of CVD risk across a range of LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol concentrations.

Methods and Results

Number needed to treat to prevent one event revealed exclusion from the treatment of some people with higher cholesterol levels, who may benefit more than others needlessly exposed to statins with no realistic prospect of benefit. Furthermore, abandonment of cholesterol therapeutic goals disadvantaged people with higher levels.

Conclusion

These problems can be overcome by basing the decision to treat on the NNT calculated both from absolute CVD risk and also on the LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achievable with statin treatment. This need not adds an additional layer of complexity for the clinician, because computer programmes already used to estimate CVD risk could be easily amended, thus permitting more effective deployment of statins in the population.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^722655c0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### Recent update to the US cholesterol treatment guidelines: a comparison with international guidelines [^01b949c6]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guideline advocated several changes from the previous Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Assuming full implementation, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline would identify ≈13 million Americans as newly eligible for consideration of statin therapy. Three features of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline primarily responsible for these differences are the specific risk assessment tool endorsed, the risk threshold considered sufficient to warrant primary prevention statin therapy, and the decision not to include cholesterol treatment targets. There is no consensus among international guidelines on the optimal approach to these 3 components. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends assessing absolute risk with the Pooled Cohort equations, which were developed to improve on previous risk assessment models by including stroke as an outcome and by broadening racial and geographic diversity. Each of the leading international guidelines recommends a different equation for absolute risk assessment. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline advises consideration of statin therapy for an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, which is lower than the thresholds recommended by other leading international guidelines. Lastly, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline does not endorse a treat-to-target strategy but instead specifies the appropriate intensity of statin for each risk category. This approach is shared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines but differs from other international guidelines. In this review, we summarize the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations and compare them with recommendations from Adult Treatment Panel III and other leading international guidelines.

Statin therapy — Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^4c46c8d5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

### Statin therapy in women [^2bb0d178]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol recommend therapy for patients with (1) known cardiovascular disease (CVD); (2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 190 mg/dL or higher; (3) type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and LDL-C between 70 mg/dL and 189 mg/dL (for ages 40–75); and 4) LDL-C between 70 mg/dL and 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5% (for ages 40–75), using their new risk calculator. Although statin therapy is indicated for women at elevated risk of CVD, safety concerns related to glucose elevations and myalgias may outweigh benefits for women at low absolute risk of CVD.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^79cf8b96]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^73010106]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^f65a5e3d]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^6dfee316]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^e0ad0db7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, which contain a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use (1.3)

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.
Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered", although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence". Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted", and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients".

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^5532cf70]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

Primary prevention — borderline/intermediate ASCVD risk in adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes: Patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to < 7.5% were judged borderline and initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy may be considered, while those with 7.5% to < 20% are intermediate risk and the guideline recommends that such patients be considered for treatment with a moderate-intensity statin; in borderline or intermediate risk started on moderate-intensity statin, patients are recommended to achieve a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; inadequate response is defined as < 30% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), for which routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if these thresholds are not achieved, the writing committee recommends consideration of escalation to a high-intensity statin.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3f54197f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b123e085]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia and the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines: myths, oversimplification, and misinterpretation versus facts [^10ab52a8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic condition resulting in severe, lifelong elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a marked increased risk of early-onset coronary disease. FH is treatable when identified, yet is vastly under-recognized and undertreated. Although the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol presented a paradigm shift, we believe that there have been serious oversimplifications, misinterpretations, and erroneous reporting about the current ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines that have contributed to suboptimal care for these subjects. In summary, the ACC/AHA guidelines place tremendous emphasis on the identification of patients with FH, the initiation of high-intensity statin therapy, the need to obtain follow-up lipid values to assess the efficacy and compliance to lifestyle and medical therapy, and the role of nonstatin drugs when needed for optimal care of the individual patient.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^0fdc680a]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Four cases of cholesterol management informed by the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology multisociety guideline on the management of blood cholesterol [^734ac704]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

These 4 hypothetical cases highlight some of the new features in the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology multisociety cholesterol management guidelines. Topics include management issues in a secondary prevention patient judged to be at very high risk of another event, a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 190 mg/dL or greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), a primary prevention patient with intermediate (7.5%-19.9%) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, and a patient who has statin-associated adverse effects. A multiple-choice format is used to engage clinicians in selecting the best choice based on guidance from the new 2018 cholesterol management guidelines.

### Recommendations for statin management in primary prevention: disparities among international risk scores [^aef1c221]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the consensus-driven process of algorithmic risk stratification as the first step to determine statin allocation in primary prevention in many prominent lipid guidelines leads to marked heterogeneity on an international scale with respect to treatment eligibility and the potential need for ancillary testing. In the context of such heterogeneity, most algorithms systematically identify candidates for treatment who are predominantly male, are of advanced age, and have co-morbidities of hypertension and/or smoking. Whether this is the best approach for reducing or eliminating lipid-specific cardiovascular risk in the general population should be re-considered.

Perspectives: core clinical competencies

Risk algorithms induce profound variance in statin treatment decisions and the potential for reliance on ancillary testing. The results bring into question whether algorithm-based approaches are optimal for lowering lipid-related risk in primary prevention.

Translational outlook

Additional studies are required to establish an internationally accepted patient phenotype warranting primary prevention therapy with statins based on available randomized clinical trial data.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^533e7e75]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^a65966f8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^efb5fedd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Combination drug therapy in dyslipidemia management — Therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent may be considered for patients who have not reached their treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with very high or high risk, and the maximum tolerated statin dosage should generally be used before add-on therapy is considered. Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d76c7231]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — Initial risk stratification required the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and the magnitude of benefit was considered proportional to estimated risk, such that a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% provides at least a small net benefit and 10% or greater provides at least a moderate net benefit; the recommendation concerns initiating statins, and in adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins; these recommendations do not pertain to adults with familial hypercholesterolemia or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L).

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — risk-enhancing factors for intermediate risk indicates that knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for all individuals but particularly for those at intermediate risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤ 20%). An example cited is that a family history of premature ASCVD identified women ≥ 60 years of age with elevated hs-CRP and without ASCVD who benefited from high-intensity statin therapy, and those with primary LDL-C elevations of ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L) have elevated lifetime ASCVD risk.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^d19e07dd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

### A current approach to statin intolerance [^d8b3de61]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the first-line pharmacotherapy for cholesterol reduction. Use of these drugs in large randomized clinical trials has consistently shown significant reductions in major vascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization. The updated guidelines for the treatment of high blood cholesterol from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), will lead to an increase in the number of patients taking statins. Hence, the number of cases of statin intolerance may subsequently increase, emphasizing the need to understand and treat this important problem.

ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations for clinical ASCVD state that "High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD*, unless contraindicated". (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). If high-intensity therapy "is contraindicated† or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated". (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). For individuals with clinical ASCVD " > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug–drug interactions and to consider patient preferences, when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin. It is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it". (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A). The document defines clinical ASCVD as "Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin".

### For clinicians… [^cd350438]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Featured Resource For people with high LDL cholesterol levels or for others at high risk for having an ASCVD event in the next 10 years, experts recommend lifestyle changes and cholesterol-lowering medications to lower ASCVD risk. Clinical blood cholesterol treatment guidelines released in 2013 from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommended statins for four main groups who might benefit. 1 In November 2018, new clinical guidelines were released by the ACC, AHA, and others that provide additional specificity to the 2013 recommendations, reinforce the need for appropriate-intensity statin therapy among people at risk of having an ASCVD event, and emphasize the importance of patient–clinician shared decision making.
2. About Statins Statins, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, lower LDL cholesterol by reducing the liver's production of cholesterol.

They also improve the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. 6 Data from 2013–2014 indicate that only about half of U. S. adults who might benefit from statin use are taking them. Some groups are more likely to use statins for cholesterol management than others: 7 The 39. 1 million people who are at high risk for an ASCVD event but are not taking a statin could reduce their risk of a heart attack or stroke by up to half if therapy were taken regularly. 7, 8 Clinicians and patients should weigh this significant potential benefit against the small risk of experiencing harmful side effects: The 2018 ACC/AHA guidelines state that very high-risk individuals who have suboptimal LDL levels after maximal doses of statins may also benefit from additional medications: 14 Bile acid sequestrants. These medicines help remove cholesterol from the blood by removing bile acids.

The body needs bile acids, and removing them forces the liver to make more, which it does by breaking down LDL cholesterol, consequently lowering serum cholesterol levels.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^5c8cc94c]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

### Present status of statin therapy [^55cc7e2b]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination with added risk reduction by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention where the absolute risk reduction is much less are more difficult, involving LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management — if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents — pharmacologic therapy is supported with carefully qualified indications: Statins and nonstatins lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), and randomized controlled trials demonstrate low short- and medium-term adverse event rates with statin use. These data "support the use of statins in children and adolescents at age ≥ 10 years who have FH and have not responded to 3 to 6 months of lifestyle therapy", and "statins may be considered at age 8 years" with concerning family history, extremely elevated LDL-C, or elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], within informed shared decision-making. Treatment intensity "should be based on the severity of the hypercholesterolemia and should incorporate patient and family preference". Nonstatin options noted include ezetimibe, which shows reasonable LDL-C lowering with no significant adverse effects, and nonsystemic bile acid sequestrants, which "can be useful" for LDL-C lowering though tolerability is an issue.

### Advances in lipid therapy: the role of lipid treatment in women in primary prevention [^99e2ce22]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women. Given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women, primary prevention is an important focus. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines for men and women on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults based on randomized-controlled trials. Fixed and appropriate intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual's risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patients for primary prevention is recommended rather than cholesterol level goals. A more recent consensus statement regarding the role of non-statin therapies has been released, but like the prior guidelines released in 2013, there were no sex-specific recommendations. An evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women.

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk". LDL levels are reported in mg/dL.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: informing risk / benefit decisions [^280141bb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults-even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the current guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^3434cc43]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

American dyslipidemia guidelines discuss the atherogenic potential of non-HDL-C but do not incorporate non-HDL-C treatment thresholds for primary prevention, instead focusing on percent LDL-C lowering(though the 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for nonstatin therapies includes non-HDL-C thresholds). Although primary prevention risk calculators (eg, 2013 American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Pooled Risk, 2024 Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events [PREVENT]), incorporate non-HDL-C levels indirectly by including total cholesterol and HDL-C, none require explicit knowledge or reflection on inputting a non-HDL result into the calculator to estimate risk. As a result, to most clinicians in routine practice, the importance of non-HDL levels in risk estimates may remain unclear. European and Canadian clinical practice guidelines incorporate non-HDL-C thresholds for intensification into their treatment algorithms, along with LDL-C thresholds. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society's (CCS) 2021 dyslipidemia guideline suggests that in primary prevention, a person with intermediate CV risk should be offered a statin when LDL-C is ≥ 135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C ≥ 162 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L). If a statin is initiated and LDL-C remains ≥ 77 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C > 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), dose adjustment or add-on therapy could then be considered. In the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, non-HDL-C is a secondary lipid target particularly in persons with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Examining the association between non-HDL-C and LDL-C levels following statin initiation and CV risk can help elucidate the real-world implications of guideline recommendations that include non-HDL-C. We hypothesize that there is residual risk associated with achieved LDL-C below guideline-directed thresholds for intensification in the setting of non-HDL-C above recommended thresholds. Therefore, we sought to examine patterns of LDL-C and non-HDL-C lipid levels after statin initiation for primary prevention and their association with CV outcomes.

Atherogenic cholesterol lowering — statin therapy and risk factor management emphasizes that moderate- and high-intensity statins are reasonable for most patients, while in hypercholesterolemic patients who are statin intolerant, alternate atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drugs or alternative statin dosing regimens may need to be considered; nonlipid atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus, and therapies to lower cholesterol will reduce ASCVD risk even in the presence of other risk factors, with identified risk factors requiring management to maximize ASCVD risk reduction.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk-based therapies identify persistently elevated triglycerides (nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dl) as a risk-enhancing factor and outline statin thresholds and effects. In primary prevention patients without diabetes mellitus or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5% to < 20%, the presence of persistent hypertriglyceridemia supports a decision to initiate at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, and for 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% to < 7.5% patient-clinician discussion is recommended regarding initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. Statins provide a 10% to 30% dose-dependent reduction in triglycerides in patients with elevated triglyceride levels; similarly, statin therapy should be initiated or maximized if such patients have a history of diabetes mellitus or ASCVD, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated at ≥ 500 to 999 mg/dL following initiation of statin therapy, the clinician should consider intensification and monitor adherence to therapy.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^0f3dcf67]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^e740b975]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

Clinical recommendations quoted from the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); in individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); and in individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A).

### ACC / AHA release updated guideline on the treatment of… [^f9eae5b4]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice The guideline emphasizes that lifestyle modification remains a critical component of ASCVD reduction. Four groups most likely to benefit from statin therapy are identified:

1. Patients with any form of clinical ASCVD
2. Patients with primary LDL-C levels of 190 mg per dL or greater 3. Patients with diabetes mellitus, 40 to 75 years of age, with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL
4. Patients without diabetes, 40 to 75 years of age, with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7. 5%. Decades of research have demonstrated an association between high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Randomized controlled trials have found that treating with statins reduces ASCVD events.

Based on these data, the Blood Cholesterol Expert Panel from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued an updated evidence-based guideline in 2013 that addresses the use of fixed doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce the risk of ASCVD in adults 21 years and older. to 189 mg per dL but without clinical ASCVD; and persons without clinical ASCVD or diabetes who have LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% or greater. The guideline identifies high- and moderate-intensity statin therapy for use in primary and secondary prevention. The absolute risk reduction in ASCVD events associated with statin therapy can be estimated by multiplying the 10-year ASCVD risk by the anticipated relative risk reduction based on the intensity of the statin.

The net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit is approximately the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with statin therapy vs. the number of potential excess adverse effects. Persons with LDL-C less than 190 mg per dL who do not fall into a statin benefit group or for whom risk-based treatment is uncertain, other factors may be used to inform treatment decision making. Statin therapy may be considered after evaluating for potential benefits, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences.

Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — screening and statin initiation criteria span childhood to older adulthood: screening can be performed with fasting or nonfasting measurement of lipids. In children, adolescents (10 to 19 years of age), and young adults (20 to 39 years of age), priority should be given to estimation of lifetime risk and promotion of lifestyle risk reduction, and Drug therapy is needed only in selected patients with moderately high LDL-C levels (≥ 160 mg/dL [≥ 4.1 mmol/L]) or patients with very high LDL-C levels (190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]). Three major higher-risk categories are patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]), adults 20 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus, and adults 40 to 75 years of age, and Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus are candidates for immediate statin therapy without further risk assessment. In other adults 40 to 75 years of age, 10-year ASCVD risk should guide therapeutic considerations; when risk is uncertain, it can be helpful to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC), and a CAC score equal to 0 is useful for reclassifying patients to a lower-risk group, often allowing statin therapy to be withheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are present. For patients > 75 years of age, RCT evidence for statin therapy is not strong, so clinical assessment of risk status in a clinician–patient risk discussion is needed for deciding whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.

Risk-enhancing factors for primary prevention — role and thresholds in clinician–patient decision-making: In the clinician-patient risk discussion they can be useful for identifying specific factors that influence risk, and their presence helps to confirm a higher risk state and thereby supports a decision to initiate or intensify statin therapy. Examples that denote high lifetime risk for ASCVD and favor initiation of statin therapy include LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L), apoB ≥ 130 mg/dL (particularly when accompanied by persistently elevated triglycerides), and elevated Lp(a). Additional noted factors are family history of ASCVD, premature menopause, and South Asian race, which appear to convey a higher baseline risk and are stronger candidates for statin therapy, and conditions associated with systemic inflammation (chronic inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) which reasonably justifies statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients.

Lifestyle modifications

In addition to pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions should be emphasized. These include:

- **Heart-healthy diet**: Adopting a diet low in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates, while rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, is essential.
- **Physical activity**: Encouraging regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, can help improve lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular health.

Although the patient's CAC score of 0 AU suggests a low short-term risk of cardiovascular events, the elevated Lp(a) level and family history of premature CAD indicate an elevated long-term ASCVD risk. Initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy, along with lifestyle modifications, is recommended to reduce LDL-C and mitigate the patient's lifetime ASCVD risk. Regular monitoring of lipid levels and continued cardiovascular risk assessment are critical to ensure appropriate management and adherence to therapy. A fasting lipid panel should be repeated 4 to 12 weeks after initiating statin therapy to assess the patient's response. The goal is to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C from baseline or an LDL-C level below 100 mg/dL. Further follow-up visits should assess adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes, as well as monitor for any adverse effects of the medication. This approach of using Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor is consistent with AHA/ACC guidance. Furthermore, de-risking patients with a CAC of 0 is consistent with the ACC ECDP although no specific note is made of Lp(a) and CAC of 0. Similarly, the ESC and CCS guidelines discuss Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing feature but do not discuss a role for CAC testing in this setting. No guideline provides specific treatment recommendations based on elevated Lp(a).

### The risk-benefit paradigm vs the causal exposure paradigm: LDL as a primary cause of vascular disease [^fee532a5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

All current guidelines use the 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event to select subjects for statin primary preventive therapy. Benefit from therapy is stated to be determined by risk with the result that statin primary preventive therapy is initiated only when the risk of a cardiovascular event over the next decade exceeds a specified level. Thus all current guidelines are based primarily on the Risk-Benefit paradigm of primary prevention. The recent American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines differ from others in basing selection for statin therapy virtually exclusively on risk except for those few subjects with markedly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The Causal Exposure paradigm differs from the Risk-Benefit paradigm in that the objective of therapy is to prevent the anatomic disease within arterial walls that produces cardiovascular risk. Moreover, the anatomic disease and, therefore, the cardiovascular risk, is a function of the injurious action of the causal factors of vascular disease, such as blood pressure and LDL, on the arterial wall over long periods. In this article, we explain the strengths and weaknesses of both paradigms to provide a more secure framework to compare the strengths and weaknesses in the different cholesterol guidelines with particular emphasis on the evidence that the cardiovascular risk and the benefit from statin therapy is related to the level of LDL.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk of CHD, FLOLIPID can be started simultaneously with diet.

1.1 Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events

In patients at high risk of coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, FLOLIPID is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing CHD deaths.
Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke.
Reduce the need for coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures.

1.2 Hyperlipidemia

FLOLIPID is indicated to:

Reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa, heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb).
Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV hyperlipidemia).
Reduce elevated TG and VLDL-C in patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia).
Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

### Excluded populations… [^6b7f5298]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level.

There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent.

Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe. Icosapent ethyl appears to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality with elevated triglyceride levels, although the single trial results are controversial because of high rates of cardiovascular events in the control group. Target cholesterol levels are not recommended to guide these decisions. For patients taking statins, monitoring response by measuring lipid levels is generally unnecessary because titration to a specific cholesterol level is of uncertain benefit. Cholesterol measurement for patients receiving secondary prevention should be limited to only those high-risk patients in whom icosapent ethyl or PCSK9 inhibitors are being considered. Editor's Note: Drs. Arnold and Buelt are members of the 2020 VA/DoD Dyslipidemia Guideline Working Group.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^2359437f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^23a6256f]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### New cholesterol guidelines and primary prevention in women [^121c8de3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States. The role of primary prevention of CVD is a necessary focus of healthcare, given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released new guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults that were based on results of randomized controlled trials. These guidelines apply to both men and women. Achievement of a target cholesterol level is no longer part of the guidelines. Rather, the guidelines recommend an appropriate and fixed intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual׳s risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated LDL-C for primary prevention. The new guidelines emphasize statin therapy over other lipid-lowering therapy. The new guidelines are evidence-based, coming from randomized control trials that have clearly demonstrated improved outcomes using statin therapy in those with ASCVD and those at high risk of ASCVD, not based on LDL targets but rather LDL lowering. This evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women. There were no specific sex differences in the new guidelines, and the focus of this article is to provide the evidence to support the use of these guidelines in women.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^d2294976]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### Practical guidance for combination lipid-modifying therapy in high-and very-high-risk patients: a statement from a European Atherosclerosis Society task force [^c81ba940]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Task Force provides practical guidance for combination therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or triglycerides (TG) in high-risk and very-high-risk patients.

Methods

Evidence-based review.

Results

Statin-ezetimibe combination treatment is the first choice for managing elevated LDL-C and should be given upfront in very-high-risk patients with high LDL-C unlikely to reach goal with a statin, and in primary prevention familial hypercholesterolaemia patients. A proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor may be added if LDL-C levels remain high. In high and very-high-risk patients with mild to moderately elevated TG levels (> 2.3 and < 5.6 mmol/L [> 200 and < 500 mg/dL) on a statin, treatment with either a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) may be considered, weighing the benefit versus risks. Combination with fenofibrate may be considered for both macro- and microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Conclusions

This guidance aims to improve real-world use of guideline-recommended combination lipid modifying treatment.

Safety is another important consideration when increasing the proportion of adults receiving statin therapy. Dr Robinson, co‐author of the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline, 6 summarized safety data on statin therapy, 14, 27, 28 which indicated that the 5‐year NNH was ≈167 for moderate‐ and 63 for high‐intensity statin therapy. 19 With regard to the risk‐to‐benefit considerations with high‐ versus moderate‐intensity statin therapy, and assuming a linear relationship between 1‐ and 5‐year risk, the 5‐year NNT in adults with CHD taking high‐ versus moderate‐intensity statin is 31 to prevent a major vascular event versus an NNH of 100 for diabetes mellitus. 15 Analyses from JUPITER indicate that statin‐related diabetes mellitus reflects a shortening of the latent period from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus by a few weeks. In JUPITER, only minimal changes in the fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin values were observed among all statin‐treated participants. 27
