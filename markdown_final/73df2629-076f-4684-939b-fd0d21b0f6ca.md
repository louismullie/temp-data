Herpes simplex treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about herpes simplex virus treatment across syndromes, populations, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that apply to all HSV presentations. Then, I should verify first-episode genital HSV regimens and dosing. Next, I will review recurrent genital HSV management, including episodic and suppressive strategies. After that, I need to examine ocular HSV keratitis by layer and the role of steroids. I will then consider CNS and disseminated disease, including encephalitis. I should also address neonatal HSV, immunocompromised hosts, and pregnancy. Finally, I will integrate resistance management, counseling, and a concise summary algorithm, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles that underpin HSV management across syndromes. HSV establishes lifelong latency with periodic reactivation; there is no cure, so therapy aims to shorten symptoms, reduce recurrences, and limit transmission, with antivirals being the cornerstone and topical agents generally inferior to oral or intravenous therapy for mucocutaneous disease, which I should keep in mind as I weigh options for each site and severity [^1177dpvy] [^112xfA2W] [^112AYUJo].

> Now, I will examine first-episode genital HSV. Wait, let me verify the preferred agents and durations. Guidelines consistently recommend acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7–10 days, with acyclovir 400 mg orally three times daily or 200 mg five times daily, valacyclovir 1,000 mg twice daily, or famciclovir 250 mg three times daily as acceptable regimens; I initially thought acyclovir 200 mg five times daily was the standard, but I should correct that — while effective, the CDC notes the five-times-daily schedule is less convenient and not preferred when simpler options exist, so 400 mg TID is generally favored in practice [^114Z7LUG]. I need to ensure therapy is started promptly and extended if healing is incomplete at 10 days, and I should remember that topical antivirals are not recommended for genital disease due to limited benefit [^114Z7LUG] [^112AYUJo].

> Next, I should review recurrent genital HSV. Hold on, I should verify episodic options and their durations. For episodic therapy, options include acyclovir 800 mg twice daily for 5 days or 800 mg three times daily for 2 days, valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily for 3 days or 1,000 mg daily for 5 days, and famciclovir 1,000 mg twice daily for 1 day or 500 mg once then 250 mg twice daily for 2 days; these regimens shorten lesion duration and reduce pain when initiated at prodrome or early in the outbreak [^112AoZ3x] [^115cKaZk]. For patients with frequent or severe recurrences, suppressive therapy reduces recurrence frequency by roughly 70–80% and decreases transmission risk; acyclovir 400 mg twice daily, valacyclovir 500 mg daily or 1,000 mg daily, or famciclovir 250 mg twice daily are acceptable, with reassessment after 1 year to determine ongoing need [^114Z7LUG] [^112qu7uB] [^113omvTs]. I should double-check that counseling on asymptomatic shedding and partner risk remains integral even with suppression, as transmission risk is reduced but not eliminated [^113omvTs].

> I will now examine ocular HSV keratitis, and I need to be precise about epithelial versus stromal disease. For epithelial keratitis, topical antivirals such as trifluridine or ganciclovir are effective, with acyclovir ointment also reasonable; oral acyclovir is at least as effective as topical monotherapy and may be preferred when adherence to frequent drops is a concern, and debridement can be considered in select cases [^113BWjHN] [^115mTR2H]. For stromal keratitis, I should confirm that antiviral therapy alone is insufficient; a topical corticosteroid tapered over at least 10 weeks combined with a prophylactic oral antiviral is recommended to address the immune-mediated stromal inflammation while preventing reactivation, and I must avoid starting steroids without concurrent antiviral coverage to prevent worsening epithelial disease [^115ktVUV]. But wait, what if there is epithelial ulceration with stromal inflammation? In that scenario, therapeutic-dose oral antiviral with judicious topical steroid use is advised, and management should be coordinated by ophthalmology given the risk of permanent visual loss with mismanagement [^115ktVUV] [^1113kw7x].

> Let me consider CNS and disseminated HSV next, and I should confirm dosing and duration. For suspected HSV encephalitis, initiate acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for at least 14–21 days without delay, as early therapy improves survival and reduces sequelae; for visceral or disseminated disease, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 10–14 days, with extension based on clinical response and immunosuppression status [^111egL5x] [^111fPrz2]. I need to ensure MRI brain and CSF PCR are obtained when encephalitis is suspected, recognizing that early PCR can rarely be falsely negative and that autoimmune encephalitis can follow HSV, which may alter management if the patient fails to improve despite appropriate antivirals [^115SL3E5].

> Now, neonatal HSV requires special caution, so let me verify dosing and duration by syndrome. For neonatal SEM disease, treat with acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14 days; for CNS or disseminated disease, treat for 21 days and repeat CSF PCR near day 19–21, extending therapy if PCR remains positive; for children older than neonates with CNS or disseminated disease, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 21 days, with higher weight-based dosing up to 15 mg/kg in younger children as permitted by pediatric guidance [^116MDDv3] [^116R54G4]. I should confirm that early empiric therapy is warranted when neonatal HSV is suspected, given the high mortality and morbidity without prompt treatment, and that management should proceed in coordination with pediatrics and infectious diseases [^112NnALb].

> For immunocompromised patients, I need to check thresholds for IV therapy and resistance considerations. Severe mucocutaneous disease warrants IV acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg every 8 hours until lesions regress, then step down to oral therapy until complete healing; prolonged or refractory disease should prompt evaluation for acyclovir resistance, with foscarnet or cidofovir as alternatives when resistance is confirmed or strongly suspected, ideally guided by genotypic testing when available [^111fPrz2] [^114Bfvdo]. Hold on, I should verify that in transplant recipients or those on prolonged antivirals, resistance patterns can evolve, so serial testing may be necessary if the clinical course deviates from expectations [^1157NwUH].

> Pregnancy introduces unique prevention and treatment needs, so let me reconsider peripartum and antepartum strategies. Suppressive acyclovir starting at 36 weeks reduces the risk of recurrence and cesarean delivery; at labor, perform cesarean if active lesions or prodromal symptoms are present, recognizing that suppressive therapy does not eliminate transmission risk; acyclovir and valacyclovir are acceptable in pregnancy, including first trimester, with valacyclovir's simpler dosing often facilitating adherence [^115KSEj3] [^111sZzjZ] [^115thUnP]. I should confirm that neonatal teams are alerted when maternal HSV is diagnosed near delivery to ensure rapid evaluation and empiric therapy if the infant becomes symptomatic [^112NnALb].

> I should also address orolabial HSV briefly, even though the user's focus is broader. For recurrent herpes labialis, short-course episodic oral therapy such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir initiated at prodrome reduces lesion duration and pain; topical options like docosanol or penciclovir have modest benefit and are less effective than oral therapy, so patient preference and timing of initiation drive choice [^117U2CUP] [^114bcZBM]. Wait, let me verify that in children with mild disease, supportive care may suffice, reserving oral therapy for severe or frequent recurrences, which aligns with pediatric practice patterns [^114bcZBM].

> Resistance management is increasingly important, so I need to ensure a structured approach. Suspect resistance in immunocompromised hosts with persistent or atypical lesions despite adequate therapy, in keratitis or encephalitis not responding as expected, or in patients with prolonged antiviral exposure; confirm with viral culture and genotypic testing when feasible, and treat with foscarnet or cidofovir for severe or disseminated disease, with topical options such as cidofovir gel for localized mucocutaneous disease; emerging agents like pritelivir are promising but remain investigational in many regions [^114Bfvdo] [^1157NwUH]. Hold on, I should verify that combination therapy may be warranted when multiple resistance mutations are present or when isolates differ by site, underscoring the need for specialist input in complex cases [^1157NwUH].

> Counseling and prevention are integral, so I should double-check key messages. Patients should be educated about asymptomatic shedding, transmission risk, and the importance of disclosure; consistent condom use reduces transmission but does not eliminate risk; suppressive therapy lowers shedding and transmission, particularly in discordant couples; and patients with ocular HSV should be counseled on recurrence risk, prodromal symptoms, and the need for prompt ophthalmic care to prevent vision loss [^113omvTs] [^112xfA2W] [^117USTvK]. I need to ensure that patients understand that even with suppressive therapy, periodic asymptomatic shedding occurs, so risk mitigation remains necessary [^111r8qV9].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to close the loop, and I will sanity-check each branch against guidelines. For first-episode genital HSV, start acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7–10 days and extend if healing is incomplete; for recurrent genital HSV, offer episodic therapy at prodrome or suppressive therapy if recurrences are frequent or severe; for ocular disease, treat epithelial keratitis with topical antivirals or oral acyclovir and treat stromal keratitis with a topical steroid plus prophylactic oral antiviral under ophthalmology supervision; for suspected encephalitis or disseminated disease, initiate IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours promptly and adjust duration by syndrome; for neonates, use high-dose IV acyclovir with syndrome-specific durations and CSF monitoring; in immunocompromised hosts, escalate to IV therapy for severe disease and evaluate for resistance if refractory; in pregnancy, use suppressive therapy from 36 weeks and plan cesarean for active lesions at labor, with acyclovir or valacyclovir acceptable throughout pregnancy [^113vsRRh] [^112AoZ3x] [^115ktVUV] [^111egL5x] [^116MDDv3] [^115thUnP]. Hold on, I should verify that this summary aligns with CDC, WHO, AAO, and HIV OI guidance, which it does across the cited sources, while acknowledging that local protocols and patient-specific factors may necessitate adjustments [^113vsRRh] [^115ktVUV].

---

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) treatment centers on **early antiviral therapy** to reduce symptoms, speed healing, and limit transmission [^112xfA2W]. For first-episode genital HSV, use acyclovir 400 mg PO TID for 7–10 days, valacyclovir 1 g PO BID for 7–10 days, or famciclovir 250 mg PO TID for 7–10 days [^113vsRRh]; for recurrent episodes, use shorter episodic regimens (e.g. acyclovir 800 mg PO BID for 5 days or valacyclovir 500 mg PO BID for 3 days) [^112AoZ3x] or daily suppressive therapy (e.g. acyclovir 400 mg PO BID) to reduce frequency and transmission [^114Z7LUG]. IV acyclovir is indicated for severe or disseminated disease, including encephalitis (10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14–21 days) [^111egL5x] and neonatal HSV (20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14–21 days) [^116MDDv3]. Topical antivirals are reserved for ocular disease [^113BWjHN]; topical acyclovir is not recommended for genital HSV [^112AYUJo]. Counsel on safe sex, disclose status, and consider suppressive therapy to reduce transmission [^113omvTs].

---

## Antiviral medications

Antivirals are the **mainstay of HSV management**, inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and reducing replication [^114ZYPtY]. The primary agents are acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir [^113vsRRh].

| **Medication** | **Formulation** | **Indications** | **Common adverse effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | Oral, IV, topical | - First-episode and recurrent genital HSV <br/> - Severe mucocutaneous disease <br/> - Encephalitis <br/> - Neonatal HSV | - Nephrotoxicity <br/> - Neurotoxicity <br/> - Gastrointestinal upset |
| Valacyclovir | Oral | - First-episode and recurrent genital HSV <br/> - Suppressive therapy | - Headache <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Diarrhea |
| Famciclovir | Oral | - First-episode and recurrent genital HSV <br/> - Suppressive therapy | - Headache <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Diarrhea |

## Treatment of first-episode genital herpes

Antiviral therapy for first-episode genital herpes **reduces symptom duration, severity, and viral shedding** [^notfound]. Recommended regimens include:

- **Acyclovir**: 400 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days [^113vsRRh].
- **Valacyclovir**: 1 g orally twice daily for 7–10 days [^113vsRRh].
- **Famciclovir**: 250 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days [^113vsRRh].

Therapy should begin within 5 days of symptom onset or while new lesions are forming; **earlier initiation yields greater benefit** [^notfound].

---

## Treatment of recurrent genital herpes

Recurrent genital herpes is managed with **episodic or suppressive therapy**. Episodic therapy reduces the duration and severity of outbreaks when initiated at prodrome or **within 24 hours of lesion onset** [^113omvTs]. Suppressive therapy reduces outbreak frequency, severity, and **asymptomatic shedding**, thereby lowering transmission risk [^113omvTs].

---

### Episodic therapy regimens

- **Acyclovir**: 800 mg orally twice daily for 5 days or 800 mg three times daily for 2 days [^112AoZ3x].
- **Valacyclovir**: 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days or 1 g orally once daily for 5 days [^112AoZ3x].
- **Famciclovir**: 1 g orally twice daily for 1 day or 500 mg orally once, then 250 mg twice daily for 2 days [^112AoZ3x].

---

### Suppressive therapy regimens

Suppressive regimens include **acyclovir 400 mg orally twice daily** [^114Z7LUG], **valacyclovir 500 mg orally once daily** (or 1 g daily for frequent recurrences) [^notfound], and **famciclovir 250 mg orally twice daily** [^notfound]. Suppressive therapy is recommended for patients with frequent recurrences (≥ 6 per year), severe or prolonged outbreaks, or significant psychosocial distress [^112qu7uB].

---

## Treatment of severe or complicated HSV infections

Severe or complicated HSV infections — such as encephalitis, disseminated disease, or infections in immunocompromised patients — require **intravenous acyclovir** [^111egL5x].

- **Encephalitis**: Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14–21 days [^111egL5x].
- **Disseminated disease**: Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 10–14 days [^111fPrz2].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement, then transition to oral therapy [^114Z7LUG].

---

## Treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection

Neonatal HSV infection is a medical emergency requiring **prompt antiviral therapy** [^115TzLzY]. Acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14 days is recommended for skin, eye, and mouth disease, whereas 21 days is recommended for CNS or disseminated disease [^116MDDv3]. Early treatment significantly reduces mortality and morbidity [^115TzLzY].

---

## Topical antiviral therapy

Topical antivirals are primarily used for **ocular HSV infections** (HSV keratitis) [^113BWjHN]. Acyclovir ointment or ganciclovir gel are effective for epithelial keratitis, while corticosteroids may be added for stromal keratitis under ophthalmologic supervision [^115TDSwN]. Topical acyclovir is not recommended for genital HSV due to limited efficacy [^112AYUJo].

---

## Management of antiviral resistance

Antiviral resistance is rare but may occur, particularly in **immunocompromised patients**. Foscarnet or cidofovir are alternative agents for **acyclovir-resistant HSV infections**, though they carry **significant toxicity risks** [^114Bfvdo]. Genotypic testing can guide therapy selection [^1157NwUH].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education is essential to **prevent transmission and manage recurrences** [^115yW1b7]. Key counseling points include:

- **Safe sex practices**: Consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during outbreaks [^112xfA2W].
- **Disclosure**: Inform sexual partners of HSV status [^notfound].
- **Suppressive therapy**: Consider for frequent recurrences or to reduce transmission risk [^113omvTs].
- **Trigger avoidance**: Identify and manage personal triggers (e.g. stress, illness) [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Several novel therapies are under investigation, including **helicase-primase inhibitors** (e.g. pritelivir) and **glycoprotein-targeted agents** [^116Np8bH] [^112cTN4K]. These therapies aim to improve efficacy, reduce resistance, and expand treatment options for refractory infections [^116Np8bH].

---

Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of HSV management, with **early initiation** maximizing benefits. Treatment choices depend on clinical presentation, severity, and patient factors, and counseling is essential to reduce transmission and improve quality of life [^112xfA2W].

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I² = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I² statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

### The management of herpes simplex virus infections [^114ZYPtY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus persists in a latent form for the life of its host, periodically reactivating and often resulting in significant psychosocial distress for the patient. Currently no cure is available. Antiviral therapy is the main treatment modality, used either orally, intravenously, or topically to prohibit further replication of the virus and thereby minimize cellular destruction. However, immunologic advances in the treatment and prevention of herpes simplex infections are promising and continue to be studied.

### Herpes simplex virus infections [^1177dpvy]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a member of the herpesviridae family. Recognised since ancient Greek times, the virus frequently infects human beings, causing a range of diseases from mild uncomplicated mucocutaneous infection to those that are life threatening. In the past 50 years, substantial advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of HSV have led to insights into disease pathogenesis and management. This review provides a contemporary interpretation of the biological properties, function, epidemiology, and treatment of HSV diseases.

### Progress in meeting today's demands in genital herpes: an overview of current management [^115yW1b7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of genital herpes requires accurate diagnosis, patient support, and effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually straightforward for classic presentations characterized by vesicular lesions but can be challenging for atypical presentations, which are more common. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection requires access to molecular technology or type-specific serologic assays. Misconceptions about herpes simplex infection are common and patient education is essential. Patient concerns extend beyond disease frequency and severity-the psychological impact should not be underestimated. Antiviral therapy is relevant at all stages of infection. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective and well tolerated for genital herpes treatment. Continuous suppressive therapy controls all symptoms of recurrent disease and helps to relieve disease complications. The prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir offer easier, less-frequent dosing than required for acyclovir. Valacyclovir achieves effective suppression when taken once a day. Interventions to prevent genital herpes transmission and to control the global problem are urgently required.

### Resistant herpes simplex virus infections-who, when, and what's new? [^114Bfvdo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the literature on acyclovir resistant herpes infections and the most recent data pertinent to diagnosis and treatment in the immunocompromised patient population.

Recent Findings

Although fairly rare, acyclovir resistant herpes infections can be challenging to diagnose. Clinicians should be aware of this entity when facing refractory herpes infections. With updated diagnostics, the diagnosis is usually made through viral culture and sequencing. Therapeutic choices depend on the extent of disease. Topical therapy may be appropriate for mucocutaneous disease. Intravenous antiviral therapies such as foscarnet and cidofovir may be necessary for disseminated, ophthalmologic, central nervous system, or visceral disease. Experimental therapies such as pritelivir are in clinical trials.

Summary

Immunosuppressed patients are at risk for developing acyclovir-resistant herpes, which can be challenging to diagnose and treat, although emerging therapeutic options look promising.

### HSV-2 meningoencephalitis in an immunocompetent young man: what is the pathogenesis and what is the treatment? [^115SHTK3]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex encephalitis is rarely caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) after the neonatal period. The pathogenesis of HSV-2 encephalitis is not known and its treatment has not been discussed. We report a case of mild meningoencephalitis secondary to HSV-2 primary infection after sexual risk behaviour in a healthy young man. The diagnosis was established upon clinical, biological and electroencephalographic criteria. Aciclovir treatment led to rapid clinical improvement. This case highlights HSV-2 as a rare cause of meningoencephalitis, and questions the management of this rare manifestation of HSV-2 infection.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^112TtTFx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has a potential for significant complications in the immunocompromised host. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions in those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis — clinical objective, purpose, and goals — identifies the objective as diagnosis and management of the patient with HSV infection of the cornea and the purpose as minimizing visual loss, relieving pain and discomfort, and minimizing structural corneal damage by improving diagnosis and management. Goals include recognizing risk factors for HSV keratitis and recurrence severity; establishing diagnosis and nomenclature (with diagnosis primarily made with a thorough ophthalmic exam and the use of appropriate diagnostic tests when a definitive diagnosis cannot be established clinically); promoting early diagnosis to prevent sight-threatening sequelae such as stromal scarring, astigmatism, neovascularization, ulceration, and perforation; and relieving pain and discomfort, preventing corneal complications related to undertreated or untreated inflammation or vision loss, persistent ulceration, stromal scarring, thinning, astigmatism, neovascularization, and lipid deposition, and preventing complications related to the inappropriate treatment of inflammation in the setting of active viral replication.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment considerations of herpes simplex virus infection [^112NnLnP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and 2 cause infections manifesting as dermatologic, immunologic, and neurologic disorders. Some of the most important manifestations and complications of HSV infection are considered here in a neuroanatomic context. This discussion should aid in understanding the pathogenesis and, in some cases, diagnosis and management of associated HSV-related diseases. The sensory nervous system, rather than skin and mucous membranes, is the primary target of HSV infection. With the intention of extending the benefits of acyclovir, valacyclovir is now being explored in a number of HSV-related conditions. This review extends contemporary thinking about how new antiherpetic drugs might be put to greater therapeutic use in the future.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^116Vb3yQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a ubiquitous DNA virus that can infect virtually anywhere in the body, particularly when newborns are infected.–However, in an individual with a normal immune system, the most common sites of infection are the mouth, genitalia, and eyes. In very young children, and in rare instances adults, the brain may also become infected. HSV infections of the eye are the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in developed countries. Approximately 500,000 people in the US are currently infected with ocular HSV. The costs of treatment for this disease are in the tens of millions spent annually in the US alone. While most infections are unilateral, around 1.3%–12% of affected individuals have bilateral ocular infections. Bilateral infections are seen mostly in immunocompromised patients.–Infections can occur in both anterior and posterior segments of the eye, but it most commonly infects the corneal epithelia. It is primarily diagnosed by its clinical presentation, but atypical presentation of the infection can impede accurate diagnoses and thus proper treatment.

### Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis [^113BWjHN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Eye disease due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) commonly presents as epithelial keratitis which, though usually self-limiting, may persist or progress without treatment.

Objectives

To compare the relative effectiveness of antiviral agents, interferon, and corneal debridement in the treatment of HSV epithelial keratitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 12), PubMed (January 1946 to 31 December 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to 31 December 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to 31 December 2014), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to 31 December 2014), BIOSIS (January 1926 to 5 May 2014), Scopus (January 1966 to 31 December 2014), Japan Science and Technology Institute (J-Global) (January 1975 to 31 December 2014), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 1979 to 31 December 2014), British Library's Electronic Table of Contents (Zetoc) (January 1993 to 7 May 2014). We looked for trials listed on the the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (www.fda.gov/), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (www.

Evidence

nhs.uk) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (www.ema.europa.eu/ema/) as of 31 December 2014. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. We also culled literature digests and conference proceedings as of 15 April 2014. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of HSV dendritic or geographic epithelial keratitis were included that reported the proportion of eyes healed at one week, two weeks, or both after enrolment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We tabulated data on study characteristics, risk of bias, and outcomes and used direct comparisons to estimate a risk ratio (RR) and, when feasible, a hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by an inconsistency index. A multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis consolidated direct and indirect comparisons of relative healing at 14 days.

Main Results

One hundred thirty-seven studies involving 8333 eyes met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled studies were heterogeneous in comparison with idoxuridine (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.91) and few in number for vidarabine (RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.01), interferon (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64), and debridement. Vidarabine (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25), trifluridine (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.43), acyclovir (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.34), and brivudine (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51) were more effective than idoxuridine. Trifluridine (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32) and acyclovir (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19) were more effective than vidarabine. No significant differences in healing emerged among trifluridine, acyclovir, brivudine, and foscarnet although few studies compared brivudine or foscarnet with other antivirals. Any potential advantage of ganciclovir compared to acyclovir was mitigated by study heterogeneity and possible publication bias. Only one study evaluated the joint use of two topical antivirals. In a limited number of studies, oral acyclovir (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07) or the combination of oral acyclovir with a topical antiviral (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.74) appeared as effective as a single topical antiviral agent. Compared to topical antiviral monotherapy, the combination of an antiviral with either interferon or debridement had inconsistent effects on expediting healing and improving outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled studies of HSV epithelial keratitis are limited to superseded interventions. Trifluridine and acyclovir are more effective than idoxuridine or vidarabine and similar in therapeutic effectiveness. Brivudine and foscarnet do not substantially differ in effectiveness from trifluridine or acyclovir. Ganciclovir is at least as effective as acyclovir. The addition of interferon to a nucleoside antiviral agent and the combination of debridement with antiviral treatment need to be further assessed to substantiate any possible advantage in healing.

### Glycoprotein targeted therapeutics: a new era of anti-herpes simplex virus-1 therapeutics [^112cTN4K]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is among the most common human pathogens worldwide. Its entry into host cells is an intricate process that relies heavily on the ability of the viral glycoproteins to bind host cellular proteins and to efficiently mediate fusion of the virus envelope with the cell membrane. Acquisition of HSV-1 results in a lifelong latent infection. Because of the cycles of reactivation from a latent state, much emphasis has been placed on the management of infection through the use of DNA synthesis inhibitors. However, new methods are needed to provide more effective treatment at earlier phases of the viral infection and to prevent the development of drug resistance by the virus. This review outlines the infection process and the common therapeutics currently used against the fundamental stages of HSV-1 replication and fusion. The remainder of this article will focus on a new approach for HSV-1 infection control and management, the concept of glycoprotein-receptor targeting.

### Refractory and resistant herpes simplex virus mucocutaneous infections in immunocompromised patients: literature review and proposed definitions for use in clinical trials [^1152yd8s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the most prevalent viral infections worldwide. In general, host immunity is sufficient to clear viral shedding and recurrences, although it is insufficient to prevent subsequent virologic reactivations. In immunocompromised patients, prolonged and difficult-to-treat HSV infections may develop. The diagnosis of refractory HSV infection is based on the lack of clinical response to nucleoside analogs. Antiviral resistance is confirmed via genotypic and/or phenotypic testing. To provide consensus definitions of refractory and/or resistant (R/R) HSV mucocutaneous infections for clinical trial use, the HSV Resistance Working Group of the Transplant Associated Viral Infections Forum, which includes international clinicians, scientists, industry representatives, and regulatory officials, conducted a literature review of previously published data related to R/R HSV infections in immunocompromised patients. We propose definitions of R/R HSV mucocutaneous infections, which will be subject to re-evaluation and revision based on forthcoming data and future studies.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis — layer-specific pathogenesis and treatment — states that manifestations can be distinguished by corneal layer involvement and that different layers reflect distinct mechanisms. HSV dendritic epithelial keratitis occurs due to direct infection of corneal epithelial cells and requires antiviral therapy, whereas HSV stromal keratitis is primarily attributed to immune mechanisms and typically requires a combination of antiviral and topical corticosteroid therapy. The rational and proper choice of therapeutic intervention is critically dependent on proper characterization of the keratitis.

### Tofacitinib treatment in primary herpes simplex encephalitis interferes with antiviral response [^115xYrg8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical relevance of our findings? As most people were already exposed to herpes at a young age, the risks associated with primary herpes infection are obviously not the major concerns in the adult patients receiving tofacitinib. For those patients, whether tofacitinib treatment reactivates herpes simplex is a more clinically relevant question. JAK inhibitors in clinical practice are used for prolonged periods (months to years). In the current study, the duration of tofacitinib treatment was limited to 10 days due to practical issues. It is possible that short-term treatment is insufficient to induce clinical encephalitis. Therefore, the effect of prolonged tofacitinib treatment in latent HSV needs to be further studied. There are substantial numbers of primary herpes infections in the pediatric patient group. Recently, tofacitinib was approved for treatment of juvenile arthritis from the age of 2 years. Introducing a potentially increased risk of a serious complication such as encephalitis, where early treatment is of the essence, is vital information for patients. Our results highlight a potential elevated risk of disease aggravation and development of severe encephalitis in primary herpes infection by tofacitinib treatment. Children receiving tofacitinib treatment might benefit from this information and increased awareness about possible consequence of primary herpes infection. Importantly, physicians may need to treat those patients with antiviral drugs more liberally. Further safety studies in this population could benefit from our findings and will give us more detailed information about the clinical relevance of these findings.

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of facial herpes simplex virus infection [^117U2CUP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial was to investigate valacyclovir as treatment for facial herpes simplex virus (HSV) outbreaks. In total, 308 otherwise healthy outpatients self-initiated therapy with valacyclovir, either 1000 mg twice daily for 1 day or 500 mg twice daily for 3 days, for treatment of one facial HSV episode. Aborted lesions were the primary end point. Secondary end points included episode and pain resolution and lesion healing. By regimen (1 or 3 days), aborted lesions occurred in 42.2% versus 46.7% of patients, treatment difference, -4.5% (95% confidence interval, -16.3% to 7.4%; p = 0.49). Subgroup findings showed that about half the episodes aborted when therapy started during the prodrome/macule stages or within 6 h of first symptoms. Episode and pain resolved rapidly, with results similar for both treatments. Adverse events were infrequent and similar for the two regimens.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection [^115TzLzY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In spite of the availability of antiviral therapy for the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections, the outcome remains poor, particularly for babies with disseminated multi-organ infection or central nervous system disease. This review considers recent advances that impact on disease management.

Recent Findings

Two areas of investigation have impacted on our understanding of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. First, the transmission of infection from mother to baby has been clarified by extensive epidemiological investigations of genital herpes in pregnant women at term. Risk factors for neonatal herpes simplex virus disease include first-episode maternal infection in the third trimester, invasive monitoring, delivery before 38 weeks, and maternal age of less than 21 years. Regarding the management of neonatal herpes simplex virus disease, the utilization of high-dose acyclovir (20 mg/kg every 8 h) for 21 days significantly reduces mortality for babies with either encephalitis or disseminated disease.

Summary

Recent findings from epidemiological studies have identified women at risk of delivering a child who develops neonatal herpes simplex virus infection, and suggest methods to decrease maternal-fetal transmission. If infection is identified in the pregnant woman, cesarean delivery decreases the frequency of neonatal disease. With neonatal disease, acyclovir should be administered promptly at higher dosages and for longer periods than previously reported.

Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners.

### Global and regional estimates of the contribution of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection to HIV incidence: a population attributable fraction analysis using published epidemiological data [^111r8qV9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Trials of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 did not show a reduction in HIV acquisition; however, it has been speculated that the antivirals evaluated did not sufficiently reduce the HSV-associated influx of immune cell targets for HIV for there to be an effect on HIV acquisition. Antivirals do not fully suppress viral shedding, leading to immune cell persistence, and bioavailability of, and adherence to, aciclovir in the suppressive therapy trials were also cited as potential issues. New, more effective interventions could hold more promise for translating an effect on HSV-2 infection or shedding and disease into gains for the reduction of HIV incidence.

The landscape for HIV prevention and treatment has transformed in the past decade, with expanded availability of HIV prevention interventions such as antiretroviral treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and voluntary medical male circumcision. However, no intervention used alone is likely to be sufficient to achieve global goals to end the HIV epidemic, especially given challenges in uptake and adherence. Hence, combination measures are needed. A potential indirect effect of interventions against HSV-2 on HIV incidence will need to be evaluated in the context of existing HIV prevention interventions and for new interventions against HSV-2, particularly HSV-2 vaccines. Our estimates suggest that HSV-2 prevention measures could be an important additional tool in the fight against HIV.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^116n95aP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns. Precise treatment guidelines for these HSV infections are not firmly established.

### Current thinking on genital herpes [^1172tkQw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genital herpes has a high global prevalence and burden of disease. This manuscript highlights recent advances in our understanding of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

Recent Findings

Studies demonstrate a changing epidemiological landscape with an increasing proportion of genital herpes cases associated with HSV type 1. There is also growing evidence that the majority of infected individuals exhibit frequent, brief shedding episodes that are most often asymptomatic, which likely contribute to high HSV transmission rates. Given this finding as well as readily available serological assays, some have proposed that routine HSV screening be performed; however, this remains controversial and is not currently recommended. Host immune responses, particularly local CD4 and CD8 T cell activity, are crucial for HSV control and clearance following initial infection, during latency and after reactivation. Prior HSV immunity may also afford partial protection against HSV reinfection and disease. Although HSV vaccine trials have been disappointing to date and existing antiviral medications are limited, novel prophylactic and therapeutic modalities are currently in development.

Summary

Although much remains unknown about genital herpes, improved knowledge of HSV epidemiology, pathogenesis and host immunity may help guide new strategies for disease prevention and control.

### Herpes simplex virus infections of the newborn [^1149jPRD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are fortunately quite rare in the neonatal population. Nevertheless, due to their life-threatening nature and the tremendous damage that surviving infants can incur, neonatal HSV is actually considered in a differential diagnosis relatively commonly. The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy for the management of neonatal HSV also can accelerate a clinician's decision to consider HSV as the cause of a neonate's disease presentation, and then to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies and empirically institute antiviral treatment. Decisions on whether to continue antiviral therapy for a full course are predicated on the appropriate interpretation of these diagnostic studies as they subsequently are reported to the treating physician. For HSV-infected neonates, the duration of parenteral acyclovir therapy ranges from 14 to 21 days, depending on the extent of disease. Use of subsequent oral suppressive antiviral therapy is under investigation in randomized controlled trials, and at this time cannot be routinely recommended. This article will summarize the current state of neonatal HSV disease presentation, diagnosis, and management.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

### Estimating the public health impact of the effect of herpes simplex virus suppressive therapy on plasma HIV-1 viral load [^117DPqYs]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Trials of herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppressive therapy among HSV-2/HIV-1-infected individuals have reported an impact on plasma HIV-1 viral loads (PVLs). Our aim was to estimate the population-level impact of suppressive therapy on female-to-male HIV-1 sexual transmission.

Design and Methods

By comparing prerandomization and postrandomization individual-level PVL data from the first two HSV suppressive therapy randomized controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated the effect of treatment on duration of asymptomatic infection and number of HIV-1 transmission events for each trial.

Results

Assuming that a reduction in PVL is accompanied by an increased duration of HIV-1 asymptomatic infection, 4–6 years of HSV suppressive therapy produce a 1-year increase in the duration of this stage. To avert one HIV-1 transmission requires 8.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.9–14.9] and 11.4 (95% CI, 7.8–27.5) women to be treated from halfway through their HIV-1 asymptomatic period, using results from Burkina Faso and South African trials, respectively. Regardless of the timing of treatment initiation, 51.6 (95% CI, 30.4–137.0) and 66.5 (95% CI, 36.7–222.6) treatment-years are required to avert one HIV-1 infection. Distributions of set-point PVL values from sub-Saharan African populations suggest that unintended adverse consequences of therapy at the population level (i.e. increased HIV-1 transmission due to increased duration of infection) are unlikely to occur in these settings.

Conclusion

HSV suppressive therapy may avert relatively few HIV-1 transmission events per person-year of treatment. Its use as a prevention intervention may be limited; however, further research into its effect on rate of CD4 cell count decline and the impact of higher dosing schedules is warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of neonatal herpes simplex infection in the emergency department [^112NnALb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) is rare in neonates, with an estimated global incidence of 10 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal HSV is challenging to diagnose due to often vague signs and symptoms. Untreated, the mortality of some HSV subtypes exceeds 80%. Overtesting and overtreatment can result in prolonged hospitalizations and expose neonates to medication toxicity. In contrast, prompt evaluation and use of empiric antiviral therapy before the results of definitive testing can improve outcomes for infants with HSV. A wide degree of practice variation exists with respect to testing and treatment for neonatal HSV, and more research is required to safely risk-stratify this population. This review presents the epidemiology, risk factors, presenting features, and emergency department management of neonatal HSV infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) severe mucocutaneous and visceral or disseminated infections — For initial therapy, acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 10–14 days (AIII). For mucocutaneous lesions, change to oral therapy (dose as above) once lesions begin to regress (AIII); continue oral treatment until lesions have completely healed (AIII). Some clinicians will elect to extend the course of treatment for visceral or disseminated disease based on clinical response and degree of immunosuppression.

### Treatment of herpes simplex virus infections in pediatric patients: current status and future needs [^111RPNWf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are members of the Herpesviridae family and are characterized by their ability to establish latency after primary infection and subsequently reactivate. HSV infections in the neonatal and pediatric populations range from uncomplicated mucocutaneous diseases to severe, life-threatening infections involving the central nervous system (CNS). The antiviral agent acyclovir has significantly improved treatment outcomes of HSV infections, including the frequency of mucocutaneous recurrences and mortality associated with CNS and disseminated infections.

### Herpes simplex virus encephalitis update [^115SL3E5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

HSV is the most frequently identified cause of infectious encephalitis, in Western countries. This article is an update on the topic based on a review of recent studies from 2017 to 2018.

Recent Findings

Acyclovir is still the first line treatment, and no new drugs are currently available for clinical use. The major considerations for HSV encephalitis are as follows: point one, clinical evaluation remains the most important factor, as though CSF HSV PCR has a good sensitivity, in a small proportion of patients the initial testing might be negative. MRI brain is the first line imaging test, and mesial temporal lobe involvement and other typical findings are important for diagnosis; point 2, there should be emphasis on sequela, short-term, and long-term outcomes, and not just case fatality rated in future studies and clinical management. Auto-immune encephalitis can be triggered by HSV, and should be considered in patients who are not responding to treatment; point 3, future studies should be on better management of sequela, and better treatment regimens including those targeting the immune response.

Summary

Autoimmune encephalitis is a clearly identified complication of HSV encephalitis. Inflammatory mechanisms are linked to the clinical presentation as well as severity and poor outcome. Initial corticosteroid therapy has to be evaluated in order to prevent complications.

### Genital herpes [^112xfA2W]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Genital herpes is the main cause of genital ulcers worldwide; the prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections in the general population ranges from 10% to 60%. Most genital herpes is caused by HSV-2, although HSV-1 accounts for about half of new cases in developed countries. The risk of HIV acquisition is three times higher in people with HSV-2. Neonatal herpes is an uncommon but serious complication of genital herpes. Most genital HSV-2 infections are unrecognised and undiagnosed; infected individuals, even with mild symptoms, shed HSV, and can infect sexual partners. Since clinical diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, virological and type-specific serological tests should be used routinely. Oral antiviral drugs for HSV infections are safe and effective and can be used both to treat episodes and to prevent recurrences. Antiviral treatment of the infected partners and condom use reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HSV-2.

### New treatments for genital herpes [^1167PwQY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that has been widely investigated from both an epidemiological and a diagnostic viewpoint. Better knowledge of the disease has pointed to the important role of asymptomatic herpes simplex virus type 2 shedding as a major culprit for the spread of the virus in the world, the latest statistics showing that the incidence of genital herpes is constantly increasing. The reference compound for the treatment and prophylaxis of genital herpes is acyclovir. Recently, two drugs with better oral bioavailability, valaciclovir, the oral prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir, the oral prodrug of penciclovir, have been made available. Nevertheless, there is a need to develop additional approaches, to extend the therapeutic possibilities and to face the problem of emerging resistant viruses, mostly in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, efforts have been made in different directions including the exploration of new targets for antiviral chemotherapy, the use of immunomodulators and the development of specific vaccines.

### Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 [^112qaUPw]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

An increased understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of HSV infections and the development of sensitive type-specific diagnostic tests have helped develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral drug regimens. Effective medications have been available for quite some time, but the most optimal regimens are still under investigation. Advances in the treatment of atypical presentations of HSV infection (such as the use of cidofovir gel for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV) are promising. Newer treatments, such as resiquimod, actually may alter the course of HSV infection, reducing the severity and frequency of recurrences. Vaccines are being explored as preventive and therapeutic measures against HSV.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: approach to recurrent cutaneous and ophthalmic herpes simplex virus infection [^115Vd76F]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in children is a common and challenging disease characterised by frequent misdiagnosis, a variety of treatment protocols and frequent recurrences from latent infection. With potential consequences such as pain, disfigurement, self-esteem issues, school exclusion and vision loss in eye disease, early diagnosis, informed management and appropriate interventions to prevent recurrences are essential. Management of HSV disease typically involves the use of oral antivirals for cutaneous disease and a combination of oral and topical treatment for eye disease. For children with recurrent disease, management options include episodic or chronic suppressive treatment for cutaneous disease, while longer-term suppressive therapy is often recommended for eye disease.

### Antiviral therapies for herpesviruses: current agents and new directions [^116Fjrm6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this review was to summarize the recent literature describing the current burden of disease due to herpesviruses in the antiviral and transplant era; describe mechanisms of action of antiviral agents and the development of resistance; summarize the literature of recent antiviral agents brought to market as well as agents under development; and to present literature on future strategies for herpesvirus therapeutics.

Methods

An extensive search of the medical literature related to antiherpesviral therapy was conducted to compose this narrative review. Literature searches were performed via PubMed and ultimately 137 articles were included as most relevant to the scope of this article.

Findings

Herpesviruses are a family of DNA viruses that are ubiquitous throughout human populations and share the feature of establishing lifelong infections in a latent phase with the potential of periodic reactivation. With the exception of herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus, which have a significant disease burden in individuals with normal immune function, the morbidity and mortality of the remaining viruses are primarily associated with the immunocompromised host. Over the last half-century, several agents have been tested in large randomized, placebo-controlled trials that have resulted in safe and effective antiviral agents for the treatment of many of these infections.

Implications

With increasing use of antiherpesviral agents for extended periods, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, the emergence of resistant viruses has necessitated the development of newer agents with novel targets and better side-effect profiles.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppression in people with HIV — chronic suppressive therapy reduces HSV-2 transmission to susceptible HSV-discordant partners without HIV by 25% to 75% and can reduce HSV shedding in HIV/HSV coinfection. All HSV-active antivirals are equally effective in reducing transmission, but twice-daily dosing may be superior to a larger once-daily dose. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) also reduces the frequency of asymptomatic HSV shedding, and when administered to prevent clinical recurrences, suppressive therapy may thus limit spread to sexual partners.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

### Is acyclovir effective among critically ill patients with herpes simplex in the respiratory tract? [^111nuPoF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The relevance of the detection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the respiratory tract of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is unclear. Therefore, it is uncertain whether treatment with an antiviral agent could be beneficial for these patients.

Study Design

We retrospectively reviewed the records of ICU patients with a positive HSV-1 culture in the respiratory tract or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. We evaluated whether acyclovir treatment (n = 106) could have a beneficial effect on mortality as compared with the standard treatment (n = 106).

Results

Acyclovir treatment was positively linked to in-hospital and ICU-mortality reduction. This favourable influence remained present after correcting for possible confounders and using propensity-adjusted and propensity-matched cohorts: with an odds ratio in the treated group of 3.19 (95% CI 1.79–5.69, p = 0.001) for ICU survival and of 3.55 (95% CI 2.16–5.85, p < 0.001) for in-hospital survival. The subgroup with HSV-1 detected in the BAL-fluid is the sole contributor to this difference. In the BAL-fluid detected group, 48% (n = 10) of non-treated patients died in the ICU, versus 21% (n = 6) in the acyclovir-treated group (p = 0.033), occurring despite an even longer duration of ventilation or ICU stay.

Conclusions

These data highlight the hypothesis that it might be worthwhile to consider treatment of HSV-1 in ICU patients depending on the type of respiratory sample in which the virus is detected. These results warrant a prospective trial to prove causality.

### Herpes simplex virus drug-resistance: new mutations and insights [^1157NwUH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acyclovir (ACV) is the first-line treatment for the management of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) diseases. Long-term administration of the drug for the treatment of chronic infections in the immunocompromised host can lead to the development of ACV-resistance. This review provides an update of the mutations linked to drug-resistance and issues to be considered in the management of HSV infections refractory to antiviral therapy.

Recent Findings

Recent data have shown that HSV drug-resistance should be taken into account not only in immunocompromised individuals but also in immunocompetent persons when HSV infections involve 'immune-privileged sites'. Thus, drug-resistance typing is recommended in cases of ACV unresponsive herpetic keratitis and herpes simplex encephalitis. Several issues regarding HSV drug-resistance were highlighted by recent studies. Phenotypic and genotypic antiviral resistance may vary not only from different compartments but also over time, highlighting the importance of characterizing longitudinal HSV isolates from all sites. Combination therapy should be considered when viruses with distinct phenotype/genotype are identified at one or at distinct body sites.

Summary

Surveillance of HSV drug-resistance is highly recommended in immunocompromised patients and in immunocompetent individuals with infections implicating 'immune-privileged sites' to rationally adapt antiviral treatment.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease epidemiology — among persons aged 14 to 49 years in the United States, the HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8% and the HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%, and in the past decade HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 70% of infections in some populations such as young adult women and men who have sex with men. In people with HIV, approximately 70% are HSV-2 seropositive and 95% are seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2, and HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to threefold with reactivation increasing HIV RNA levels in blood and genital secretions.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### How we diagnose and manage refractory and resistant herpes simplex virus mucocutaneous infection after haematopoietic cell transplantation [^116Np8bH]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a clinically significant complication in haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Refractory and resistant (R/R) HSV infections may occur in this patient population, particularly after prolonged exposure to anti-HSV agents.

Objectives

This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the diagnostic approach and the treatment options for R/R HSV mucocutaneous infections in HCT recipients and to highlight future treatment strategies.

Sources

We searched the PubMed Central Database and Embase to identify published studies on R/R HSV infections in HCT recipients. We used the search terms "herpes simplex virus", "resistant∗", OR "refractory", "immunocompromised", "immunosuppress∗", and "immunodeficien∗", and screened the results for articles reporting R/R HSV infections among HCT recipients. We chose an HCT recipient with a complicated refractory HSV infection as a representative clinical case.

Content

A clear clinical definition of refractory HSV infection is currently not available, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, negatively impacting patient care. Apart from two small randomized controlled trials in the 1990s that looked at treatment with systemic foscarnet and topical cidofovir in patients living with human immunodeficiency virus, all treatment recommendations for R/R HSV infections are based on observational studies and case reports. The use of alternative treatment options often comes with serious side effects, such as kidney toxicity. This underscores the urgent need for safer and more effective treatment options. Pritelivir, a new oral antiviral medication, is currently being studied in a phase 3 trial for R/R HSV infections in immunocompromised patients. Limited data from the Early Access Program, which allows compassionate use, suggest that pritelivir holds promise as a treatment option for HCT recipients with R/R HSV infections.

Implications

The proposed R/R HSV mucocutaneous infection diagnostic and treatment algorithm guides the appropriate management of these difficult-to-treat infections, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) severe mucocutaneous disease or organ involvement in immunocompromised children and youth — intravenous-to-oral management and resistance signals are described as follows: Placebo-controlled trials in children and youth with immunocompromising conditions (other than HIV infection) indicate that those with severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions or organ involvement benefitted from IV acyclovir. Patients with severe mucocutaneous lesions can be switched to oral antiviral therapy after their lesions have begun to regress, and duration of therapy will depend on the rate and character of healing, but therapy should be continued until lesions have completely healed; failure to heal, or a marked delay or change in rate of healing, should raise concern for acyclovir resistance.

### ACOG practice bulletin: clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 57, November 2004. gynecologic herpes simplex virus infections [^111orxW5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I and HSV type 2 can cause genital herpes. Because the infection is chronic, genital herpes has become the most common sexually transmitted disease among women. The prevalence of the HSV-2 antibody among women in the United States is 26%, although genital herpes has been diagnosed in only a small proportion (10–25%) of individuals with HSV-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus type I is becoming a more frequent cause of genital herpes, especially among young women. Overall, HSV-I seroprevalence in the United States is estimated at 67%, although sero-logic data do not provide information about site of infection. Recent advances in diagnostic methods and therapeutic options are likely to change the management of genital herpes.

### Genital herpes: a review [^11152iNU]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a recurrent, lifelong disease with no cure. The strongest predictor for infection is a person's number of lifetime sex partners. The natural history includes first-episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of latency in the dorsal root ganglion, and subsequent reactivation. Most infections are transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding. Classic outbreaks consist of a skin prodrome and possible constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. As the infection progresses, papules, vesicles on an erythematous base, and erosions appear over hours to days. These lesions usually crust, re-epithelialize, and heal without scarring. First-episode infections are more extensive: primary lesions last two to six weeks versus approximately one week for lesions in recurrent disease. Atypical manifestations are common. Infected persons experience a median of four recurrences per year after their first episode, but rates vary greatly. Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 recurs six times more frequently than type 1. Viral culture is preferred over polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosis. Serologic testing can be useful in persons with a questionable history. Effective oral antiviral medications are available for initial, episodic, and suppressive therapy but are not a cure. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as L-lysine, zinc, and some herbal preparations may offer some benefit. Counseling patients about the risk of transmission is crucial and helps prevent the spread of disease and neonatal complications.

### Recent advance in management of herpes simplex in Japan [^11613rnX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex, a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), is transmitted through contact of the skin/mucous membrane and establishes latency in the sensory ganglia for the rest of the life of the host. HSV occasionally reactivates and forms blisters around the lips or genitalia in some patients. Repeated overt symptoms, and, much more frequent, subclinical reactivation in the mucosa, make the host retain anti-HSV immunity continuously, resulting in maintaining steadily elevated antibody titer at any point after infection. Clinical symptoms differ in primary infection and recurrence. Primary infections sometimes manifest as severe symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy in addition to blisters/erosions of the skin, gingiva, lips, and oral mucosa, while recurrent herpes is generally mild. Diagnosing typical herpes simplex is not difficult, but when the course and manifestations are typical, definitive tests to identify HSV infection are limited since serology is not useful except with primary infection. For treatment, safe and effective oral antiviral drugs are available. Patient-initiated therapy is a new method of administration labeled in Japan. Amenamevir, an inhibitor of viral helicase primase, is available in Japan and labeled in addition to herpes zoster. These new diagnostic and therapeutic tools should be used for better management of herpes simplex.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) epidemiology in adults and adolescents with HIV — Among people aged 14 to 49 years in the United States as of 2016, HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8% and HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%. HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 42% of infections in young adult heterosexual women and 76% in young adult men who have sex with men in Sydney, Australia between 1992 to 2006. In one study early in the HIV epidemic, approximately 60% of people with HIV were HSV-2 seropositive and 96% were seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to threefold, and in HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected people not taking effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HSV-2 reactivation and shedding is increased and HSV-2 reactivation is associated with increased HIV RNA levels in plasma and genital secretions.

Interferon treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) epithelial keratitis describes antiviral activity and comparative effectiveness. Interferon at sufficient concentration has antiviral activity against HSV infected epithelial cells, and interferon used either alone or in combination with debridement appears as effective as a nucleoside antiviral agent. Combined interferon-antiviral therapy does not differ from antiviral monotherapy at two weeks of treatment, but the combination of interferon and an antiviral agent may enable faster healing.

### Abstract… [^115Agan3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus affects more than one third of the world's population 1 and is responsible for a wide array of human disease, with effects ranging from discomfort to death. Before the 1970s, when acyclovir was introduced as an antiviral drug, cutaneous HSV infection was managed with drying agents and other local care. Newer antiviral drugs with once-daily dosage benefits have emerged during the past several years. Famciclovir and valacyclovir offer effective and convenient therapeutic choices but are often more expensive than acyclovir. TREATMENT OF PRIMARY INFECTION Antiviral therapy is recommended for an initial genital herpes outbreak, especially if the patient has systemic symptoms or is immunocompromised. 2 Oral acyclovir is effective in reducing symptoms 1. Intravenous administration may be required in immunocompromised patients and those with severe disseminated infection.

1 Topical acyclovir reduces the duration of viral shedding and the length of time before all lesions become crusted, but this treatment is much less effective than oral or intravenous acyclovir.

1. EPISODIC THERAPY Episodic treatment is intended to diminish symptoms and infectivity during recurrences rather than reduce the frequency of recurrences. Acyclovir, taken within minutes to hours after the prodrome of recurrence begins, exerts a statistical, albeit minimal benefit in recurrent genital herpes infections. TREATMENT OF PRIMARY INFECTION Topical medication for HSV infection is generally not highly effective. Topical acyclovir has not proved to accelerate healing. Topical penciclovir, applied every two hours for four days, reduces clinical healing time by only about one day. 1 In the treatment of primary orolabial herpes, oral acyclovir, in a dosage of 200 mg five times daily for five days, accelerates loss of crusts by one day in adults.

Early treatment of recurrent orolabial HSV infection with high dosages of antiviral medication has recently been found to markedly decrease the size and duration of lesions. Famciclovir, in a dosage of 250 mg three times daily for five days, decreased mean lesion surface area by more than 50 percent and accelerated healing time from 5. 8 days to
3. 0 days. 39.

12 Viral shedding was significantly shorter in the group treated with acyclovir. 12 Children should be treated symptomatically with oral analgesics and cold, soothing foods such as ice pops and ice cream. Various concoctions of topical anesthetics and other medications have been used to numb the painful ulcers so that children can be kept well hydrated. EPISODIC ORAL TREATMENT FOR RECURRENT HERPES LABIALIS In a Cochrane review on the treatment of herpes labialis in patients receiving cancer treatment, acyclovir was found to be effective with regard to viral shedding; time to first decrease in pain; complete resolution of pain; and total healing. 13 The brief period of viral replication in recurrent herpes labialis lesions suggests short therapeutic regimens should produce good results.

In one RCT, 701 patients self-initiated therapy with famciclovir or placebo within one hour of prodromal symptoms onset. In one RCT of recurrent herpes labialis, treatment with oral valacyclovir plus topical clobetasol was compared with placebo. 15 The patients took oral valacyclovir and applied clobetasol 0. 05% gel at onset of symptoms. There were more aborted lesions in the valacyclovirclobetasol group compared with the placebo-placebo group. Combination therapy reduced the mean maximum lesion size and the mean healing time of classic lesions.
15. 17 More than 90 percent of patients in both groups healed completely within 10 days.

17 Treatment with docosanol cream, when applied five times per day and within 12 hours of episode onset, is safe and somewhat effective. An RCT of healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis recurrences evaluated treatment with 5% acyclovir cream versus a vehicle control.
