## Question

What are the clinical features of hypertensive urgency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical features of hypertensive urgency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and diagnostic threshold. Then, I should verify the core clinical feature that distinguishes urgency from emergency. Next, I will review commonly reported symptoms and their frequency. After that, I need to check for atypical or misleading presentations and how to interpret them. Finally, I will consider special populations, reconcile evolving terminology, and synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor incorrectly. Hypertensive urgency is typically defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg without acute target organ damage, which is the critical differentiator from hypertensive emergency, where acute organ injury is present and mandates parenteral therapy and ICU-level care [^7dbb8153] [^5b5912e0] [^f062bcbf].

> Wait, let me verify the core clinical feature before listing symptoms. The defining clinical feature is the absence of acute hypertension-mediated organ damage; patients may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms, but there should be no evidence of acute cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, or ophthalmologic injury on history, exam, or testing, which is what converts an urgency into an emergency and changes management entirely [^7dbb8153] [^5b5912e0] [^f062bcbf].

> I will now examine commonly reported symptoms and their frequencies, but I should be cautious not to overinterpret them as organ damage. Headache is the most frequently reported symptom, around 42% in one ED cohort, followed by epistaxis, faintness, psychomotor agitation, and nonspecific malaise or nausea, with some patients remaining completely asymptomatic; importantly, these symptoms are nonspecific and do not, by themselves, indicate target organ injury [^0e62cb47] [^7dbb8153].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chest pain or dyspnea implying organ damage. While chest discomfort or dyspnea can occur in patients with severe hypertension, in hypertensive urgency these symptoms are typically nonspecific and not accompanied by objective evidence of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or aortic dissection; if such evidence is present, the diagnosis shifts to hypertensive emergency and mandates IV therapy and ICU care, so I need to ensure I correlate symptoms with objective findings before labeling an emergency [^5b5912e0] [^f062bcbf].

> Let me consider special populations, because the clinical picture can vary. In pediatrics, hypertensive urgency often presents with headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and visual complaints, but many children are asymptomatic; severity correlates with age and height/sex-adjusted percentiles, and children with higher BP ratios relative to the 99th percentile plus 5 mmHg tend to have more severe presentations, so I should adjust expectations to age-specific norms and not overcall symptoms as organ damage without corroboration [^daa2cbe2] [^dc3ee149].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant. In pregnancy, thresholds for concern are lower, and persistent severe hypertension (typically ≥ 160/110 mmHg) warrants urgent treatment even without clear end-organ damage because of the risk of progression to preeclampsia or eclampsia; thus, the same symptom set may carry different implications and urgency in obstetric patients, so I need to apply obstetric-specific algorithms rather than nonpregnant adult frameworks [^a8873dbc] [^8be861e8].

> I should double-check the evolving terminology so I don't mislabel cases. Contemporary guidance increasingly replaces "hypertensive urgency" with "severe hypertension without acute target organ damage", reflecting that the management and prognosis align with poorly controlled hypertension rather than a distinct acute entity; this reinforces that the key clinical feature remains the absence of acute organ injury rather than any specific symptom complex [^984425ac] [^5b5912e0] [^086e0fb1].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything critical. Clinically, hypertensive urgency is characterized by severe blood pressure elevation (≥ 180/110 mmHg) with either no symptoms or nonspecific symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, psychomotor agitation, or mild gastrointestinal upset, and — most importantly — no evidence of acute target organ damage on history, examination, or testing; if acute organ injury is identified, the diagnosis becomes hypertensive emergency and requires immediate parenteral therapy and ICU-level monitoring, so I need to actively screen for neurologic deficits, chest pain with ischemia, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and retinal hemorrhages or papilledema before concluding "urgency" [^7dbb8153] [^5b5912e0] [^f062bcbf].

---

Hypertensive urgency is defined as **severe hypertension (≥ 180/110 mmHg) without acute target organ damage** [^7dbb8153]. Patients are often asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, epistaxis, or mild anxiety [^7dbb8153] [^0e62cb47]. There is **no evidence of acute end-organ injury** — such as encephalopathy, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, or retinopathy — on history, examination, or testing [^5b5912e0]. The key clinical feature is the absence of acute target organ damage, which distinguishes hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency [^5b5912e0].

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Patients with hypertensive urgency may present with a variety of symptoms, although many are asymptomatic. Common symptoms include:

- **Headache**: Frequently reported, often nonspecific and not indicative of acute neurological injury [^7dbb8153] [^0e62cb47].

- **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: Common nonspecific symptoms [^7dbb8153].

- **Nausea or vomiting**: May occur but are not associated with acute gastrointestinal injury [^7dbb8153].

- **Epistaxis (nosebleeds)**: Occasionally reported, typically benign [^0e62cb47].

- **Mild anxiety or psychomotor agitation**: Nonspecific and not indicative of acute psychiatric injury [^7dbb8153].

- **Chest discomfort or dyspnea**: May occur but are not associated with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure [^notfound].

---

## Absence of acute target organ damage

The defining clinical feature of hypertensive urgency is the **absence of acute target organ damage**. This distinguishes it from hypertensive emergency, which involves acute injury to organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, or eyes [^5b5912e0]. Specifically, hypertensive urgency lacks:

- **Neurological injury**: No encephalopathy, stroke, or transient ischemic attack [^5b5912e0].

- **Cardiovascular injury**: No acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, or aortic dissection [^5b5912e0].

- **Renal injury**: No acute renal failure or significant proteinuria [^5b5912e0].

- **Ophthalmologic injury**: No acute retinopathy or visual loss [^5b5912e0].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

When evaluating a patient with suspected hypertensive urgency, clinicians should:

- **Confirm blood pressure**: Ensure accurate measurement with appropriate cuff size and technique [^536bfb18].

- **History and examination**: Assess for symptoms of acute target organ damage, including neurological deficits, chest pain, dyspnea, visual disturbances, and oliguria [^5b5912e0].

- **Laboratory tests**: Typically not required in asymptomatic patients without evidence of organ damage. Consider basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram if symptoms or risk factors are present [^536bfb18].

- **Imaging**: Not indicated unless specific symptoms suggest acute organ injury (e.g. chest X-ray for dyspnea, head CT for altered mental status) [^20724b44].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Hypertensive urgency, while not immediately life-threatening, indicates poorly controlled hypertension and increased risk of future cardiovascular events [^aaf48bac]. Management focuses on **gradual blood pressure reduction over 24–48 hours** using oral antihypertensive medications, close follow-up, and patient education [^5b5912e0]. Aggressive intravenous therapy or rapid blood pressure reduction is not indicated, as it may cause harm without proven benefit [^5b5912e0].

## Clinical features of hypertensive urgency

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Blood pressure | ≥ 180/110 mmHg without acute target organ damage [^7dbb8153] |
| Symptoms | - Often asymptomatic <br/> - Or nonspecific (headache, dizziness, nausea, epistaxis, mild anxiety) [^7dbb8153] [^0e62cb47] |
| Neurological | No encephalopathy, stroke, or TIA [^5b5912e0] |
| Cardiovascular | No acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or aortic dissection [^5b5912e0] |

Broader Coverage of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects by Guidelines and Protocols Proposed for the Primary Clinical Conditions

The natural diagnosis sequence in patients with hypertensive emergencies is usually from the typical manifestations of the primary clinical diagnosis and not from the detection of high BP. The management of BP is one among several steps of care in such conditions, and frequently the intervention over BP is secondary or even not considered in guidelines for the primary diagnoses.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^7dbb8153]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive urgency (HU) is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, without associated end-organ damage. Patients with HU may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, malaise, psychomotor agitation, nausea, or vomiting.

Up to 65 million Americans have hypertension; about 1% will have an episode of HU during their lives. The prevalence of HU in emergency room (ER) or office settings is estimated at 3–5%. In a recent cohort study, cardiovascular events were found to occur in less than 1% of patients within a 6-month period.

Guidance for immediate management of HU is unclear, since there is no consensus on the optimal target for acute blood pressure reduction or the time frame for achieving a normal blood pressure range. Most patients receive drug therapy for elevated blood pressure within the first 48 h of presentation. – Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of different medication choices and associated comorbidities is crucial for clinicians, especially generalists.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence of the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive medications used to treat HU in adults, either in the clinic or ER. This systematic review is intended for a broad audience, including clinicians — especially general internists — along with policymakers and funding agencies, professional societies developing clinical practice guidelines, patients and their care providers, and researchers.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^c655af25]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive urgency, ACEP 2013 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine medical intervention in the emergency department in patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP (HTN stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). Consider treating markedly elevated BP in the emergency department and/or initiate therapy for long-term control in selected patients, such as with poor follow-up. Refer patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP for outpatient follow-up.

### Clinical features in the management of selected hypertensive emergencies [^376693b7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A hypertensive emergency is a clinical diagnosis that is appropriate when marked hypertension is associated with acute target-organ damage; in this setting, lowering of blood pressure (BP) is typically begun within hours of diagnosis. For hypertensive urgency with no acute target-organ damage, BP lowering may occur over hours to days. A hypertensive emergency may present with cardiac, renal, neurologic, hemorrhagic, or obstetric manifestations, but prompt recognition of the condition and institution of rapidly acting parenteral therapy to lower BP (typically in an intensive care unit) are widely recommended. For aortic dissection, the systolic BP target is lower than 120 mm Hg, to be achieved during the first 20 minutes using a beta-blocker (typically esmolol) and a vasodilator to reduce both shear stress on the aortic tear and the BP, respectively. Otherwise, sodium nitroprusside is the agent with the lowest acquisition cost and longest record of successful use in hypertensive emergencies; however, it is metabolized to toxic thiocyanate and cyanide. Other attractive agents include fenoldopam mesylate, nicardipine, and labetalol; in pregnant women, magnesium and nifedipine are used commonly. Most authors suggest a reduction in mean arterial pressure of approximately 10% during the first hour and a further 10% to 15% during the next 2 to 4 hours; hypoperfusion can result if the BP is lowered too suddenly or too far (eg, into the range of < 140/90 mm Hg). Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6 to 12 hours of parenteral therapy, and the patient moved out of the intensive care unit, when consideration should be given to screening for secondary causes of hypertension. Long-term follow-up to ensure adequate control of hypertension is necessary to prevent further target-organ damage and recurrence of another hypertensive emergency.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^8e65a4d5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^6958f478]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^709ef022]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgency (HU), defined as acute severe uncontrolled hypertension without end-organ damage, is a common condition. Despite its association with long-term morbidity and mortality, guidance regarding immediate management is sparse. Our objective was to summarize the evidence examining the effects of antihypertensive medications to treat.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase through May 2016. Study selection: We evaluated prospective controlled clinical trials, case–control studies, and cohort studies of HU in emergency room (ER) or clinic settings. We initially identified 11,223 published articles. We reviewed 10,748 titles and abstracts and identified 538 eligible articles. We assessed the full text for eligibility and included 31 articles written in English that were clinical trials or cohort studies and provided blood pressure data within 48 h of treatment. Studies were appraised for risk of bias using components recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main outcome measured was blood pressure change with antihypertensive medications. Since studies were too diverse both clinically and methodologically to combine in a meta-analysis, tabular data and a narrative synthesis of studies are presented.

Results

We identified only 20 double-blind randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies, with 262 participants in prospective controlled trials. However, we could not pool the results of studies. In addition, comorbidities and their potential contribution to long-term treatment of these subjects were not adequately addressed in any of the reviewed studies.

Conclusions

Longitudinal studies are still needed to determine how best to lower blood pressure in patients with HU. Longer-term management of individuals who have experienced HU continues to be an area requiring further study, especially as applicable to care from the generalist.

RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) If primary aldosteronism screening is warranted, and the patient remains asymptomatic and without complications of hypertension, consider withholding a new antihypertensive regimen until blood samples can be obtained.
(2) For patients who are symptomatic (e.g. hypertensive emergency) or exhibit complications of hypertension, do not discontinue ongoing efforts to manage hypertension. Instead, interpret primary aldosterone screening results in the context of medication effects.
(3) Patients should be referred to endocrinology or hypertension specialists like nephrology or cardiology. However, which specialty should preferentially manage primary aldosteronism might differ based on the institution and available resources.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^9858647e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The recognition of the risks of high blood pressure (BP) in the last century was highlighted by observing the acute association between very high BP and medical catastrophes in emergency settings, including stroke, acute left ventricular failure, and myocardial infarction. Edward Freis was among the first authors to propose the concept of "hypertensive crisis", which he characterized as a life‐threatening disorder caused by acute or severe elevation of BP and clinical manifestations secondary to hypertension. According to Freis, the clinical manifestations included encephalopathy, neuroretinitis, evidence of rapidly advancing renal impairment, and acute heart failure.

Hypertension guidelines incorporated the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report proposed the classification of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Hypertensive emergencies were characterized by hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute left ventricular failure, dissecting aortic aneurysm, severe hypertension, toxemia, head trauma, extensive burns, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction, in which BP should be lowered within 1 hour. Urgencies were defined as situations in which BP should be controlled within 24 hours, including accelerated or malignant hypertension, perioperative hypertension, and patients requiring emergency surgeries.

With slight variations in the criteria for the definition of urgencies and emergencies, these recommendations have been repeatedly copied and pasted into the Joint National Committee guidelines and the guidelines from Europe and other countries. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertension guidelinesdefined hypertensive emergencies as severe BP elevations (> 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of hypertensive encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute renal failure, and eclampsia. The guideline defined hypertensive urgencies as situations associated with severe BP elevation in patients without an acute or impending change in target organ damage or dysfunction. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines of hypertensionincluded the diagnosis of malignant hypertension (characterized by funduscopic changes or disseminated intravascular coagulation), excluded any presentation of stroke from the criteria to characterize hypertensive emergencies, and proposed a similar definition for hypertensive urgencies.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^0f6549e5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^c2f148a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with high BP in emergency departments have worse long‐term cardiovascular outcomes than those with lower BP. This consequence is expected because these patients already have high BP levels and a longer duration of hypertension. The diagnoses of urgency and emergency would be justified if short‐term outcomes were influenced by prompt therapy in emergency departments. Nevertheless, there is no clinical trial in patients diagnosed as having hypertensive urgencies and emergencies showing the short‐term reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. The long‐term benefits would depend of the management after the discharge of the emergency department.

The denomination of hypertensive urgency for the isolated elevation of BP in the emergency room has been questioned. There is no evidence that lowering BP in a short period prevents major cardiovascular events and the prognosis was not different in patients referred to an emergency service. The resumption of medication for the chronic management of hypertension in this context can be considered.

The utility of the diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies to guide the treatment of patients in emergency departments should also be questioned. There is a clear difference between the dangerous long‐term elevation of BP, the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, and the acute elevation of BP, even if accompanied by target organ damage or dysfunction. Delayed therapy for primary clinical conditions, and treating high BP instead, continues to occur in emergency settings. Here, we propose reasons to abandon the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency (Table), which had been useful to characterize the risks of high BP but now deserves an honorable retirement.

### Management of patients with hypertensive urgencies and emergencies: a systematic review of the literature [^edc749d9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.

Methods

medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.

Results

None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.

Conclusions

Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^fc04ffaf]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe and rapid increase of the blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180/110 mmHg that often requires immediate but careful intervention to lower BP. This clinical condition often needs the access to the emergency department and can be further classified into hypertensive urgency or emergency based on the presence of acute target organ damage. Hypertensive urgencies are characterized by a rapid and severe BP elevation without organ injuries, whereas hypertension emergencies involve acute target organ damage, including the central nervous system (hypertensive encephalopathy and ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke), the cardiovascular system [myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and aorta dissection or rupture], or the kidneys (acute renal failure).

Although there has been significant overall improvement in survival after hypertensive crises over the past fifty years, both hypertensive urgency and emergency are still associated with an increased short-term risks of adverse events. Relatively few studies on small populations have investigated the long-term risk of adverse events in patients who have survived hypertensive crises, and no data are available about the impact of the number and type of target organ damage and their associated risks of adverse clinical outcomes. Our aim was to assess the one-year risk of adverse events in patients presenting with hypertensive crises, using a large global federated healthcare dataset.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

The emergency physician should recognise potentially harmful blood pressure (BP) levels and ensure they are adequately treated, in order to avoid life-threatening complications. A hypertensive emergency is a severely elevated BP complicated by target organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and/or renal). Hypertensive urgency, however, is a severe elevation in BP without target organ dysfunction. This distinction is critical for the clinical approach. The authors present a case of a severe hypertension due to primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In this case, the lack of BP measurement in the infant surveillance and the devaluation of an albuminuria detected in a previous routine urine examination, have culminated in a late diagnosis of a severe hypertension, with subsequent effects on target organs.

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies in emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f93a8a73]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies and of acute hypertension-mediated organ damage (aHMOD) in emergency departments is unknown. Moreover, the predictive value of symptoms, blood pressure (BP) levels and cardiovascular risk factors to suspect the presence of aHMOD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies in emergency departments and of the relative frequency of subtypes of aHMOD, as well as to assess the clinical variables associated with aHMOD.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, OVID, and Web of Science from their inception to 22 August 2019. Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Eight studies were analysed, including 1970 hypertensive emergencies and 4983 hypertensive urgencies. The prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies was 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively [odds ratio for hypertensive urgencies vs. hypertensive emergencies 2.5 (1.4–4.3)]. Pulmonary oedema/heart failure was the most frequent subtype of aHMOD (32%), followed by ischemic stroke (29%), acute coronary syndrome (18%), haemorrhagic stroke (11%), acute aortic syndrome (2%) and hypertensive encephalopathy (2%). No clinically meaningful difference was found for BP levels at presentations. Hypertensive urgency patients were younger than hypertensive emergency patients by 5.4 years and more often complained of nonspecific symptoms and/or headache, whereas specific symptoms were more frequent among hypertensive emergency patients.

Conclusion

Hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies are a frequent cause of access to emergency departments, with hypertensive urgencies being significantly more common. BP levels alone do not reliably predict the presence of aHMOD, which should be suspected according to the presenting signs and symptoms.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^758c2ba4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how best to safely decrease blood pressure in patients with HU. Larger and longer-term studies are also needed, including participants with other common comorbidities. Such research would hopefully provide more guidance to improve both short- and long-term cardiovascular outcome.

### Hypertensive emergencies in the emergency department [^995f14fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects approximately one-third of Americans. An additional 30% are unaware that they harbor the disease. Significantly increased blood pressure constitutes a hypertensive emergency that could lead to end-organ damage. When organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney are affected, an intervention that will lower the blood pressure in several hours is indicated. Several pharmacologic options are available for treatment, with intravenous antihypertensive therapy being the cornerstone, but there is no standard of care. Careful consideration of each patient's specific complaint, history, and physical examination guides the emergency physician through the treatment algorithm.

### Hypertensive urgency in the office setting… [^cbdd5b43]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown. Conclusions and Relevance Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later. Quiz Ref IDApproximately one-third of the US population has hypertension, which is associated with an increased risk for end-organ damage, mainly myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.

1–4 For chronic uncontrolled hypertension, every 20–mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure or 10–mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure is associated with doubling of vascular mortality. 5 Because organ damage results from increased blood pressure over time, physicians may be concerned about the potential for end-organ damage after severely elevated blood pressure, even for short periods. Many patients with hypertensive urgency undergo evaluation and treatment in the emergency department, where asymptomatic severe hypertension accounts for as many as 27% of medical emergencies10 and 3% of all visits. 10, 11 A recent American College of Emergency Physicians policy statement on this topic acknowledges the dearth of evidence supporting recommendations for optimal follow-up, checking for target organ damage, and the effectiveness of ED treatment.

12 In practice, when patients present to outpatient clinics with severely elevated blood pressure, some are directly admitted to the hospital, some are sent to the ED, and others are sent home with adjustments to antihypertensive therapy. Hypertensive urgency is a sign of poorly controlled hypertension and is associated in the longer term with end-organ damage, primarily of the heart, brain, and kidneys. 3, 5 In the office setting, however, very high blood pressure readings may also be perceived as posing an immediate risk of acute coronary syndrome or stroke, perhaps prompting hospital referral. Although less dramatic, uncontrolled hypertension in these patients is a more likely cause of long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As such, appropriate follow-up and intensification of antihypertensive therapy should be emphasized.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^b58f74d4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

WHY YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MANAGE HYPERTENSION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM

Given the frequency with which clinicians encounter hypertension and its complications, it can be habitual to initiate therapeutic interventions without considering that hypertension may be secondary to another pathophysiologic process. For hospitalists, the inpatient setting may further discourage screening of primary aldosteronism. Because intensive blood pressure management in hospitalized adults is associated with greater risk of adverse events, hospitalists may not be inclined to consider additional workup or treatment of hypertension. Moreover, hypertension due to primary aldosteronism could respond at least partially to common first‐line antihypertensive agents, thereby inducing a false sense of security. Primary aldosteronism screening aims to identify renin‐independent aldosterone overproduction. Multiple antihypertensive medications (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta‐blockers, diuretics) that frequently serve as first‐line agents for essential hypertension interact with the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Providers could therefore be concerned that use of these medications could potentially confound the diagnostic evaluation of primary aldosteronism.

A CLINICAL SCENARIO

A woman in her mid‐30s presented for shortness of breath since awakening. She additionally had palpitations, and a feeling of chest pressure that radiated to her back. In the emergency room, her blood pressure reached a peak of 190/139 mmHg. She was diagnosed with hypertensive emergency and started on intravenous and oral metoprolol tartrate, which resolved symptoms.

In the emergency department, labs were significant for hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.7 mg/dL), normal serum bicarbonate (23 mEq/L), 2+ urine protein, and 3+ urine blood. At her most recent clinic visit 3 months ago, her blood pressure was within normal limits. On hospitalist team assessment, the patient's blood pressure had improved to 154/97 mmHg. The hospitalist team thereafter diagnosed the patient with essential hypertension and continued treatment with metoprolol tartrate.

### First-attack pediatric hypertensive crisis presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^daa2cbe2]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive crisis in children is a relatively rare condition presenting with elevated blood pressure (BP) and related symptoms, and it is potentially life-threatening. The aim of this study was to survey children with first attacks of hypertensive crisis arriving at the emergency department (ED), and to determine the related parameters that predicted the severity of hypertensive crisis in children by age group.

Methods

This was a retrospective study conducted from 2000 to 2007 in pediatric patients aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of hypertensive crisis at the ED. All patients were divided into four age groups (infants, preschool age, elementary school age, and adolescents), and two severity groups (hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency). BP levels, etiology, severity, and clinical manifestations were analyzed by age group and compared between the hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency groups.

Results

The mean systolic/diastolic BP in the hypertensive crisis patients was 161/102 mmHg. The major causes of hypertensive crisis were essential hypertension, renal disorders and endocrine/metabolic disorders. Half of all patients had a single underlying cause, and 8 had a combination of underlying causes. Headache was the most common symptom (54.5%), followed by dizziness (45.5%), nausea/vomiting (36.4%) and chest pain (29.1%). A family history of hypertension was a significant predictive factor for the older patients with hypertensive crisis. Clinical manifestations and severity showed a positive correlation with age. In contrast to diastolic BP, systolic BP showed a significant trend in the older children.

Conclusions

Primary clinicians should pay attention to the pediatric patients who present with elevated blood pressure and related clinical hypertensive symptoms, especially headache, nausea/vomiting, and altered consciousness which may indicate that appropriate and immediate antihypertensive medications are necessary to prevent further damage.

### First-attack pediatric hypertensive crisis presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^a55e57f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It has been demonstrated that high blood pressure (BP) contributes to the early development of cardiovascular structural and functional changes in children. With increasingly high BP, autoregulation eventually fails, leading to damage of the vascular wall and further organ hypoperfusion. Hypertensive crisis is a critical condition characterized by a rapid, inappropriate and symptomatic elevated BP, and is categorized as hypertensive urgency (without damage of target-organs) and hypertensive emergency, which is associated with rapid deterioration of target-organs (heart, brain, kidneys and arteries), and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Hypertensive encephalopathy, an example of hypertensive emergency, is associated with hypertension (HTN) and includes a combination of various neurological manifestations such as altered mental status, headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance, seizure (76% of patients exhibit three of these four signs), or even stroke.

The causes of HTN and hypertensive crisis vary by age. Primary HTN accounts for most hypertensive children over the age of six years, and 90% of the causes of HTN in children over 15 years of age. Younger and more severe HTN pediatric patients are believed to account for secondary HTN. As a result of increasing mean BMI levels and increasing salt intake, the incidence of HTN in children appears to be steadily climbing. The incidence of HTN in 2003 was reported to range from 1% to 5% of children aged 1 to 18 years in the United States. In Taiwan, HTN has been found to range from 0.13% to 0.5% of children aged 6 to 15 years, and around 1% to 3% of school-aged children. The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical features, etiology and treatment of children with first attacks of hypertensive crisis and to determine the predictors of severity of hypertensive crisis.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^75cd082e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, if suspicion for primary aldosteronism is high enough to warrant screening, ongoing management of hypertension should not be discontinued solely for maximizing screening accuracy. Instead, the provider should conduct primary aldosteronism screening and interpret the results in the context of the patient's current medications. Conversely, it may be reasonable to withhold treatment or consider the use of antihypertensive medications with minimal RAAS interaction for a short period in those with new asymptomatic and uncomplicated hypertension.

In instances of hypertensive urgency, when symptoms related to hypertensive emergency are absent, screening for primary aldosteronism can occur. In cases of hypertensive emergency, medications such as verapamil and hydralazine may be useful before obtaining the needed laboratory samples. These practices would improve the integrity of primary aldosteronism screening, thereby guiding patients toward targeted treatment selection and improved health outcomes.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^d96ff8fb]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Most patients with a clear clinical phenotype of hypertension-mediated organ damage are admitted to the emergency department for usually mild and aspecific symptoms like dizziness, headache, pain, frequently associated to anxiety. A less aggressive approach in performing further tests for subclinical organ damage or in prescribing treatment or short-term re-evaluation by a specialist is the most common medical approach to this group of patients, perhaps underestimating the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events in this group of patients.

In addition, anxiety, psychopathological traits and drug nonadherence have been frequently overstated causes of hypertensive urgencies. Very recently nonadherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication has been reported in only 25% of patients with hypertensive urgencies presenting at the emergency department, and was associated with male sex and with a higher number of antihypertensive drugs, but not with depression or anxiety.

In our study, treated hypertensive patients with hypertensive urgencies had a high rate of BP control during the follow-up, although a greater percentage of patients did not receive antihypertensive treatment or decided to withdraw the prescribed treatment during the follow-up. Therefore, we cannot exclude that in some patients, BP values remained elevated in the long-term, justifying, at least in part, the occurrence of events.

Our registry has some obvious limitations. First, this is an observational study, with a retrospective analysis of data prospectively collected in 2015, and therefore, representing the management for hypertensive emergencies and urgencies after emergency department referral and hospitalization in a tertiary hospital in Italy 6 years ago. Second, we have not performed a follow-up visit but a telephone interview, collecting all available medical records examination from the general practitioners and by the Hospital Information System. We were able to contact 895 out of the original 1214 patients, although clinical characteristics of the original sample and of patients included in this report were superimposable. We believe that a possible consequence is the underestimation rather than overrating of cardiovascular risk in this population.

### Evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency [^cffc3dc7]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when acute organ injury is present. Careful and effective strategies to reduce blood pressure and diminish the effects of pressure-mediated injury are essential. While the selection of specific antihypertensive medications varies little across different forms of hypertensive emergencies, the intensity of blood pressure reduction to the target pressure differs substantially. Treatment hinges on balancing the positive effects of lowering blood pressure with the potential for negative effects of organ hypoperfusion in patients with altered autoregulatory mechanisms. When patients do not have acute organ injury in addition to severe hypertension, they benefit from a conservative, outpatient approach to blood pressure management. In all cases, long term control of blood pressure is paramount to prevent recurrent hypertensive emergencies and improve overall prognosis. This review discusses the current evidence and guidelines on the evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency.

### Hypertensive urgency: an undesirable complication of a "Male performance" herbal product [^496ab03e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgency is a clinical scenario that may be associated with herbal supplement use and that requires special consideration with regard to emergency department management.

Case Report

A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations and severely elevated blood pressure without evidence of end organ dysfunction. Hypertension failed to be controlled with multiple doses of oral clonidine and intravenous labetalol. The patient later admitted to using an herbal supplement containing yohimbine, a selective ⍺2-adrenoreceptor antagonist specifically linked to cases of refractory hypertension. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Between 17–35% of the U.S. adult population may use herbal supplements on a sporadic or regular basis; pharmacologically active agents in herbal supplements may affect both a patient's presentation and response to treatment. Most patients do not mention over-the-counter and herbal products in their medication profile unless specifically asked, and therefore it is important for emergency physicians to be aware of the pharmacologic effects of herbal supplements in the evaluation and treatment of refractory severe hypertension.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^638711fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^a03a8cae]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Clinicians have to frequently manage acute BP reduction for a critically ill patient, with specific indications suggested by more recent guidelines or consensus papers. Conversely, a large number of patients admitted to the emergency department have longstanding hypertension and should be referred to outpatient care rather than receive acute interventions. The short-term and long-term effects of acute BP-lowering on cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality have been evaluated in few clinical trials or surveys. Data on the prevalence of patients referred to the emergency departments describing their clinical features have increased in more recent years, underlying the relevance of this topic from a public health perspective. At the same time, more data are needed in the everyday management and follow-up of these patients. In particular, it is not clear whether patients with very high BP values (usually > 180/110 mmHg) but absence of acute hypertension-mediated target organ damage should be considered as 'uncontrolled hypertension' or 'hypertensive urgency'. As recently proposed, 'hypertensive urgencies' should not be considered a separate entity as there is no evidence that treatment in patients who lack acute hypertension-mediated organ damage is different from patients with asymptomatic uncontrolled hypertension. Some data collected in an office setting have demonstrated that cardiovascular risk is not particularly high in these patients; in addition BP control and/or the incidence of major cardiovascular events was similar in those sent home or referred to the emergency department. Other studies have shown that even patients with hypertensive urgencies, in the absence of hypertension-mediated organ damage, compared with hypertensive patients with lower BP values in the office or at admission to the emergency department, have a poorer event-free survival.

On the basis of the above considerations, we considered worthwhile to investigate the occurrence of clinical events and blood pressure control during follow-up, in patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies referred to the emergency department of 'ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia' during a period of 12 months.

### Hypertensive crisis: clinical-epidemiological profile [^65f9252b]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertensive crisis (HC) stands out as one type of acute elevation in blood pressure (BP) and can manifest as hypertensive emergency (HE-with target-organ damage (TOD)) or hypertensive urgency (HU-without TOD), usually accompanied by levels of diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical-epidemiological profile of HC over the course of 1 year in a university reference hospital and perform a review of the literature. The study was a cross-sectional study, conducted over a period of 1 year (2006) in 362 patients who presented for treatment at the emergency hospital with HC, as described above. Among all patients examined, 231 individuals met the criteria for HE and 131 met the criteria for HU. Patients with HE were older (P < 0.001) and more sedentary (P = 0.026) than those with HU. Furthermore, fewer HE patients than HU patients had previously undergone antihypertensive treatment (P = 0.006). The groups did not differ regarding BP levels, gender, smoking or body mass index. Dyspnea (41.1%), thoracic pain (37.2%) and neurological deficit (27.2%) were common signs/symptoms in those with HE. Meanwhile, in the group with HU, we most frequently found headache (42.0%), thoracic pain (41.2%) and dyspnea (34.3%). Among the forms of HE, we most frequently observed acute lung edema (30.7%), myocardial infarction/unstable angina (25.1%), and ischemic (22.9%) and hemorrhagic (14.8%) stroke. HC is a clinical entity associated with high morbidity in the emergency room. Individuals with HE are older and sedentary and have lower rates of antihypertensive treatment. Adequate control of BP should be pursued as a way to avoid this severe complication of hypertension.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting [^d112dd24]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study with propensity matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.

Results

Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean (SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure, 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; P = 0.56). Patients sent home had lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; P = 0.01) and at 8 to 30 days (59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; P = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^2ae3a846]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

### Hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and postpartum period [^a8873dbc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies, many with underlying chronic hypertension, and approximately 1–2% will undergo a hypertensive crisis at some point during their lives. Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive urgency and emergency; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy as persistent (lasting 15 min or more), acute-onset, severe hypertension, defined as systolic BP greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Pregnancy may be complicated by hypertensive crisis, with lower blood pressure threshold for end-organ damage than non-pregnant patients. Maternal assessment should include a thorough history. Fetal assessment should include heart rate tracing, ultrasound for growth and amniotic assessment, and Doppler evaluation if growth restriction is suspected. Initial management of hypertensive emergency (systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) generally includes the rapid reduction of blood pressure through the use of intravenous antihypertensive medications, with goal systolic blood pressure between 140 mmHg and 150 mmHg and diastolic pressure between 90 mmHg and 100 mmHg. First-line intravenous drugs include labetalol and hydralazine, but other agents may be used, including esmolol, nicardipine, nifedipine, and, as a last resort, sodium nitroprusside. Among patients with hypertensive urgency, slower blood pressure reduction can be provided with oral agents. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding, diagnosis, and management of hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Definitions of elevated BP states

Various terminologies have been applied to describe severe elevation in BP, including acute severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency, malignant hypertension (MHT), accelerated phase hypertension and hypertensive crisis. It is important to distinguish between the key terms to guide appropriate management and minimise the potential for iatrogenic harm.

Acute severe hypertension

The definition of 'severe' has changed progressively in the last 70 years. Most experts would accept that a BP of > 200/120 mmHg is severe, and needs urgent attention, but the degree of urgency depends on the precise circumstances. For example, a BP of 180/100 mmHg in a poorly adherent, uncontrolled chronically hypertensive patient, would not usually be considered as acute severe HTN needing immediate treatment, whereas a BP of 160/100 mmHg would be a medical (hypertensive) emergency in the context of acute end organ damage (EOD), such as preeclampsia. We prefer the term 'acute severe hypertension' to indicate patients with severe elevation in BP without evidence of acute and/or life-threatening EOD. Most patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) belong to this category and it is difficult to distinguish whether the rise in BP is acute or chronic especially if BP has not been measured recently. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (NG 136) refer to this subgroup as severe hypertension {NICE, 2019 }. The term 'hypertensive urgency' in patients who are asymptomatic is not necessarily useful as this can lead to undue anxiety in patients and increased costs to healthcare with low associated morbidity; we prefer to avoid the use of this term.

Hypertensive emergency

Hypertensive emergency is elevated BP, which when sustained over the next few hours may lead to progressive life-threatening EOD. It primarily includes conditions such as acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, aortic dissection, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, pheochromocytoma crisis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In several of these diagnoses, BP may be severely elevated though not necessarily. Even a moderate elevation of BP can be potentially life-threatening in certain situations, particularly if the elevation of BP is rapid. Rise in BP may not be the immediate causal factor in some emergency states like acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) but may co-exist and complicate management.

Risk of Bias Assessment

For controlled trials, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. For cohort studies, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Data Synthesis

We could not combine results statistically because of heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures. Furthermore, studies often lacked clearly defined primary outcomes. Therefore, we qualitatively synthesized results by antihypertensive medication class and created tables summarizing the evidence across all studies reviewed.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^741da7b1]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, patients with hypertensive emergencies present a significantly higher cardiovascular event rate, possibly explained by their higher prevalence of previous cardiovascular disease, and to a lesser extent by differences in age or sex (being men at higher cardiovascular risk profile) or other risk factors, including the degree of BP increase during the acute episode. During follow-up, stroke was the leading cardiovascular event in our study population, followed by heart failure, renal failure and acute coronary syndromes, although the higher risk of subsequent events was confirmed in our patients with all different clinical presentation of hypertension-mediated organ damage.

BP control during the follow-up in our study was not different between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, reaching more than 70% among those receiving treatment. This finding is similar to the observation of Vleck et al. showing a prevalence of BP control of 56 and 50% and comparable SBP and DBP values measured during follow-up in patients admitted with a hypertensive urgency or in the control group of hypertensive patients (admitted to the emergency department for several reasons and with BP values > 140 and/or 90 mmHg). However, we cannot exclude the role of uncontrolled BP in favoring the occurrence of cardiovascular events as the achievement of BP control was reported in a lower percentage of patients who developed subsequent cardiovascular events during the follow-up. The lack of differences in noncardiovascular hospitalization and death (because of neoplastic diseases, trauma or severe infections) between patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies not only strongly reinforces the role of optimal control of BP but also of all other risk factors in cardiovascular secondary prevention.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^e39c1058]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study provides a description of 1-year follow-up of consecutive patients referred in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in northern Italy (Brescia) with hypertensive urgencies or hypertensive emergencies. We have shown a high 1-year cardiovascular event rate and high 1-year death rate for cardiovascular causes in both hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies.

These data expand our previous observation and other studies, providing an insight into this high-risk setting of acute hypertension increase.

We have previously reported the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients examined in two different period of time (2008 and 2015) showing a prevalence of clinical presentation, which is similar to other observational studies.

We observed slight differences between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, with higher mean age and men prevalence for hypertensive emergencies. The difference in sex prevalence could be because of the absence of pregnant women with emergencies, whereas the older age of hypertensive emergencies could be the expression of more comorbidities like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus leading to higher degree of atherosclerosis and further increasing the cardiovascular risk profile of these patients.

### Association between hypertensive urgencies and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension [^aaf48bac]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with hypertensive urgency have a higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular events compared with hypertensive patients without this event.

Methods

Overall, 384 patients with hypertensive urgency and 295 control patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Hypertensive urgency was defined as a systolic blood pressure above 220 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg without any evidence of acute end-organ damage. The control group consisted of patients admitted to the emergency department with a systolic blood pressure between 135 to 180 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure between 85–110 mmHg. The number of cardiovascular events defined as acute coronary syndrome, acute stroke, atrial fibrillation, acute left ventricular failure and aortic aneurysm were consecutively analyzed during follow-up. The median follow-up time was 4.2 years (interquartile range 2.9–5.7 years). Twenty-six patients of the urgency group and 23 patients of the control group were lost for follow-up.

Results

Overall, 117 (17%) patients had nonfatal clinical cardiovascular events and 13 had (2%) fatal cardiovascular events. The frequency of cardiovascular events was significantly higher in patients with hypertensive urgencies (88 vs. 42; P = 0.005). The Cox regression analysis identified age (P < 0.001) and hypertensive urgencies (P = 0.035) as independent predictors for subsequent cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Hypertensive urgencies are associated with an increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with arterial hypertension.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^8aa82ad4]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond the increased risk of all-cause death and MACE, patients with hypertensive emergencies also had an increased risk of incident AF compared to those with hypertensive urgencies. Chronic hypertension though hemodynamic changes, neuroendocrine factors, and cardiac remodelling create a favourable environment where AF can onset and perpetuate. Thus, the high prevalence of preexisting hypertension in patients with hypertensive emergencies, may help to explain the high risk of incident AF found in these patients. However, it cannot be excluded that an acute and severe BP increase may have similar effects, especially when additional well known risk factors for AF, such as the target organ damages, are present. Regardless of the origin, both incident and preexisting AF may contribute to the high risk of adverse events in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, the risk of MACE in patients with hypertensive emergencies could be even higher than reported in our study. The subgroup analysis suggests a competitive risk between the two primary outcomes in patients with preexisting AF, potentially leading to an underestimated risk of MACE due to their high risk of all-cause death.

Additionally, we found that the incidence of new dialysis treatments over the one-year period after hospital discharge was higher in patients with hypertensive emergencies than in those with hypertensive urgencies. This may represent another key factor contributing to the increased risk of cardiovascular events, as dialysis dependence not only raises the risk of AF but also predisposes patients to other cardiovascular events and complicates the clinical management of preexisting cardiovascular conditions.

Lastly, we observed that 4% of patients with hypertensive urgencies progressed to hypertensive emergencies within one-year after hospital discharge. No previous studies have specifically investigated this aspect. Thus, these incidence data and the associated clinical phenotypes – characterised by female sex, young age, Black or Asian ethnicity together with a high cardiovascular burden – needs to be confirmed in dedicated prospective studies.

In light of these results, future studies on the clinical course of patients with hypertensive crises should place greater emphasis on the impact of both incident and preexisting AF, as well as dialysis, on the risk of adverse events. There remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding the optimal screening and therapeutic strategies for detecting and managing AF in this setting. Moreover, further research is needed to identify the key risk factors for the progression from hypertensive urgency to hypertensive emergency, allowing for the characterization of clinical phenotypes with varying levels of risk.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^0c43fd95]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

Hypertensive emergencies — burden and management principles: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Common forms of acute hypertension-related target organ damage include acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders (encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], acute ischemic stroke), and acute kidney injury (AKI), with aortic dissection the least common presentation. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of blood pressure (BP) to prevent or limit further target organ damage, whereas patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy; reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

P305 Clinical presentation of hypertensive crises in emergency medical services

G Ciobanu, A Oglinda

State University of Medicine and Pharmacy "Nicolae Testemițanu", Chisinau, Moldova

Introduction: According to the 2003 JNC 7 and to the ACC/AHA Guideline 2017 Hypertensive crisis is defined as an acute elevation of systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 120 mm Hg associated with evidence of new or worsening target organ damage. However, the absolute level of blood pressure may not be as important as the rate of increase.

Methods: The study was conducted between January and May 2017 and included 630 subjects of both sexes, aged 28–92 with a diagnosis of hypertensive crises. All subjects were divided into two groups: hypertensive urgencies (492 subjects) and hypertensive emergencies (138 subjects).

Results: The total sample of 630 subjects was 57.9% female and 42.1% male. The largest number of subjects belonged to the age group of 60–69 (36.4%) years of age: 28.8% with hypertensive urgency and 38.6% with hypertensive emergency. The average blood pressure in subjects with hypertensive crisis was 216.46/122.16 mmHg. The most common symptoms of hypertensive urgency were (42.2%), epistaxis (16.4%), faintness (8%), and psychomotor agitation (10%) while the most common symptoms of hypertensive emergency were chest pain (30.4%), dyspnea (28.6%) and neurological deficit (29%). Clinical manifestations of hypertensive emergency were cerebral infarction (26.4%), acute pulmonary edema (24.8%), hypertensive encephalopathy (20.6%), acute coronary syndromes (20.4%), cerebral hemorrhage (4,.5%), congestive heart failure (12%), aortic dissection (0.8%), preeclampsia and eclampsia (2.6%).

Conclusions: Hypertensive urgencies were significantly more common than emergencies (78.1% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients with hypertensive urgency and emergency in relation to age, gender, duration of hypertension, except for the 60–69 age group, where urgency was statistically significantly higher (p = 0.0204).

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies… [^387dcd88]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

IN ITS 1984 report, 1 the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure proposed an operational classification of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. This group suggests that emergencies are situations in which greatly elevated blood pressure must be lowered within one hour to reduce actual patient risk, whereas urgencies are situations where severe elevations in blood pressure are not causing immediate endorgan damage but should be controlled within 24 hours to reduce potential patient risk. In our view, emergencies require treatment in the hospital with parenteral antihypertensive agents to prevent immediate progression of end-organ damage. Urgencies are preferably treated with rapidly acting oral agents either inside or outside the hospital, depending on the circumstances.

The purpose of this article is to review for the practicing physician important considerations in the treatment of patients with markedly elevated blood pressure based on these definitions. The emphasis will be. Ferguson RK, Vlasses PH. Hypertensive Emergencies and Urgencies. JAMA. 1986; 255: 1607–1613.

### Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies in the cardiology emergency department: epidemiology, patient profile, and management [^33a64bd3]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive urgencies (HU) and hypertensive emergencies (HE) are common conditions in the cardiology emergency department (ED), often requiring urgent intervention. Despite their clinical significance, data on patient characteristics, etiologies, and management strategies remain limited. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology, clinical profile, and management of HU and HE in a tertiary cardiology ED. A single-center, observational study was conducted over 12 months, enrolling patients diagnosed with HU/HE (BP ≥ 180/120mmHg). Demographic data, medical history, symptoms, etiologic factors, and antihypertensive treatments were recorded. Serial blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken to assess BP reduction during the ED stay. Of 4010 cardiology ED visits, 83 patients (2.1%) had HU/HE (median age 65 years, 45.8% male). Most had a history of hypertension (73.5%), with frequent coexisting smoking (56.6%) and dyslipidemia (43.4%). Common symptoms included dyspnea (19.3%) and chest pain (25.3%). Stress (26.8%) and increased salt intake (15.9%) were common etiologic factors. HE was diagnosed in 18 cases (21.7%), and 12.7% of HU cases required hospitalization. Mean BP on admission was 200/100mmHg, with SBP and DBP reductions of 41mmHg (-21%) and 18mmHg (-17%), respectively. Nitrates, anxiolytics, and combination therapies resulted in the greatest BP reductions. In conclusion, HU and HE are frequently observed in hypertensive patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors. Target-organ damage is not solely related to BP levels, emphasizing the need for individualized management strategies.

### Clinical significance of blood pressure ratios in hypertensive crisis in children [^dc3ee149]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypertensive crisis is categorised into hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency. The present work aimed to determine the effect of different gradings of blood pressure (BP) ratios in predicting the severity of paediatric hypertensive crisis.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series, based in the paediatric emergency departments of the Changhua Christian Hospital and the Tzu-Chi General Hospital, Taiwan. From 1995 to 2010, the correlation between the severity of hypertension (HTN) and the difference in elevated systolic BP and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg (dSBP), the difference in elevated diastolic BP and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg (dDBP), dSBP ratio (dSBP/99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg) and dDBP ratio were analysed. A total of 110 children with a first attack of hypertensive crisis were recruited.

Results

Patients with hypertensive crisis caused by essential HTN had lower dDBP ratios than the other causes (p = 0.033), while those with an oncological aetiology had the highest dSBP and dDBP ratios among all the aetiologies. For clinical presentations, patients with nausea/vomiting and visual impairment presented with higher dSBP ratios than those without the symptoms (both p < 0.05), but patients with altered consciousness had higher dSBP and dDBP ratios than those who had clear consciousness (p < 0.05). Children with hypertensive urgency had lower dSBP and dDBP ratios than those with hypertensive emergency (both p < 0.05).

Conclusions

dDBP and dSBP ratios may serve as BP parameters in predicting the severity of paediatric hypertensive crisis. A dSBP ratio greater than 20% may indicate a critical point for severe hypertensive crisis in children.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^4f6747d5]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

When evaluating treatment, we categorize for classes of drugs and did not record the exact doses of all drugs for management of all patients during the follow-up.

Thirdly the results cannot be generalized to other settings as these data were collected at a single department. However, several observational available studies have shown a high rate of cardiovascular events not only in patients with hypertensive emergencies but also with hypertensive urgencies.

In conclusion, we have underscored the importance of organizing comprehensive research efforts to improve current knowledge in this growing group of high-risk patients, hoping that in the future, we will be able to provide better overall care and improve cardiovascular outcome.

### Management of inpatient elevated blood pressures: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^05e5900b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of elevated blood pressure (BP) during hospitalization varies widely, with many hospitalized adults experiencing BPs higher than those recommended for the outpatient setting.

Purpose

To systematically identify guidelines on elevated BP management in the hospital.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, and specialty society websites from 1 January 2010 to 29 January 2024.

Study Selection

Clinical practice guidelines pertaining to BP management for the adult and older adult populations in ambulatory, emergency department, and inpatient settings.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Recommendations on treatment targets, preferred antihypertensive classes, and follow-up were collected for ambulatory and inpatient settings.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen clinical practice guidelines met inclusion criteria (11 were assessed as high-quality per the AGREE II [Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II] instrument), 11 provided broad BP management recommendations, and 1 each was specific to the emergency department setting, older adults, and hypertensive crises. No guidelines provided goals for inpatient BP or recommendations for managing asymptomatic moderately elevated BP in the hospital. Six guidelines defined hypertensive urgency as BP above 180/120 mm Hg, with hypertensive emergencies requiring the addition of target organ damage. Hypertensive emergency recommendations consistently included use of intravenous antihypertensives in intensive care settings. Recommendations for managing hypertensive urgencies were inconsistent, from expert consensus, and focused on the emergency department. Outpatient treatment with oral medications and follow-up in days to weeks were most often advised. In contrast, outpatient BP goals were clearly defined, varying between 130/80 and 140/90 mm Hg.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and guidelines specific to subpopulations.

Conclusion

Despite general consensus on outpatient BP management, guidance on inpatient management of elevated BP without symptoms is lacking, which may contribute to variable practice patterns.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting: the campania salute network [^fed9decf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgencies (HypUrg) are defined as severe elevation in blood pressure (BP) without acute target organ damage. In the office setting, treated asymptomatic patients, with severe BP elevation meeting criteria for urgency are often seen. We evaluate incident Cardiovascular (CV) events (n = 311) during follow-up (FU) in patients with HypUrg at first outpatient visit.

Methods

HypUrg was defined by systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Patients were > 18 years old, with available ultrasound data, without prevalent CV disease, and no more than stage III Chronic Kidney Disease. BP control was defined as the average BP during FU < 140/90 mm Hg.

Results

Four hundred and sixty-nine of 6,929 patients presented with HypUrg at first visit. Patients with HypUrg were more likely to be women, obese and diabetic and with higher prevalence of left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy and carotid plaque (all P < 0.05). During FU patients with HypUrg had 5-fold higher risk of uncontrolled BP (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1–6.8, P < 0.0001). In Cox regression presenting with HypUrg was not associated with increased CV risk after adjusting for significant covariates, including age, sex, BP control, LV hypertrophy, and carotid plaque (hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% CI (0.96–2.11), P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Patients with HypUrg have worst CV risk profile, reduced probability of BP control during FU and greater prevalence of target organ damage, but the excess CV event risk appears to be mediated through BP control, non-BP cardio-vascular disease risk factors, and demographic attributes.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^74847e70]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Selection

Studies that 1) reported on adults with HU who received pharmacologic therapy in outpatient settings (clinic or ER) and 2) reported initial and subsequent blood pressure values within 48 h of medication administration were reviewed. Studies were excluded if they included animals, pediatric or pregnant patients, or the presence of acute end-organ damage. Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits the use of nifedipine for acute management of elevated blood pressure, articles that included only this drug were also excluded (532 studies).

Primary outcome(s): Given the lack of consensus regarding the blood pressure reduction goal when treating HU, most studies did not report dichotomous outcomes. The primary measures of treatment efficacy were reduction in SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP; in mmHg) within 48 h of pharmacologic treatment.

Secondary outcomes: We extracted adverse effects including headache, dizziness, dry mouth, hypotension, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmia, renal impairment, new-onset proteinuria, and hospitalization. None of the studies reported on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

Data extraction: Using standardized Excel forms, four groups of two investigators each (JLW, AJC, KO, DJ, CLC, AA, BB, CH) independently extracted data including the author, country, year, study type, setting, sample size, demographics, medications, details of treatment, primary outcome, adverse effects, and initial and subsequent blood pressure values. The team calculated MAP values when not explicitly calculated by the authors.

Two members of the team independently graded the strength of clinical data and subsequent recommendations for treatment of patients with HU according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Any discrepancies were resolved after a joint review and discussion with a third reviewer. Levels of evidence were as follows: level 1A, systematic reviews (with homogeneity of randomized clinical trials); level 1B, individual randomized clinical trials (with narrow confidence intervals); level 2A, systematic reviews (with homogeneity of cohort studies); and level 2B, individual cohort studies (including low-quality randomized clinical trials). Grades of recommendation are as follows: A = consistent level 1 studies; B = consistent level 2 or 3 studies, or extrapolations from level 1 studies; C = level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies; and D = level 5 evidence or inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level. Studies with a high loss to follow-up were flagged.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^a87ef7d8]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent consensus document suggests the use of uncontrolled BP as a term in substitution of hypertensive urgency, since the management with oral antihypertensive drug administration and the outcome of these patients does not differ from those with poorly controlled BP. In fact, Patel et al. have observed that major cardiovascular events occurred after 6 months in 0.9% of patients with BP values greater than 180/110 mmHg in the office, despite they were sent home from the hospital. On the opposite, as demonstrated by other several studies the prognosis of patients admitted to an emergency department for an acute rise in BP, despite the absence of hypertension-mediated organ damage, may be associated with a high risk of a cardiovascular event. Vleck et al. have followed 384 hypertensive urgencies with a mean age of 56 years for a mean period of 5 years and have shown a cardiovascular fatal and nonfatal events rate of 23%, corresponding, roughly to an incidence of 4.6/100 patients per year. Guiga et al. report a 12-month mortality of 38.9% for hypertensive emergencies and 8.9% for hypertensive urgencies. Mancusi et al. observed that the excess cardiovascular event risk in patients with hypertensive urgencies could be mediated through higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and carotid plaques. In our study, the incidence of all cardiovascular events was 27.2 and 7.2/100 patients/year, respectively in hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, once again confirming the high cardiovascular risk of these patients, higher than that observed in clinical trials including patients at high cardiovascular risk, such as the LIFE or the VALUE studies (composite endpoint rate 3.2 and 2.5/100 patients/year, respectively).

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^20724b44]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

While specific symptoms such as acute dyspnea associated with hypertensive heart failure or chest pain concerning for an acute aortic syndrome may prompt immediate treatment before a full diagnostic evaluation, symptoms alone do not define hypertensive emergencies, and ongoing IV antihypertensive treatment should depend on additional diagnostic tests that confirm acute organ injury. For the large majority of ED patients, presenting clinical features are too nonspecific to prompt immediate IV antihypertensive therapy without confirmatory testing. Table 1 describes common symptoms that emergency medicine clinicians encounter when considering new or worsening end-organ injury in the setting of markedly elevated BP. For time-sensitive conditions such as acute ischemic stroke, rapid BP lowering may be indicated when BP exceeds 185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic or endovascular treatment is planned. Most acute ischemic stroke patients, however, are not candidates for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, and BP lowering should be avoided. The ischemic penumbra lacks autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and is dependent on systemic perfusion pressure such that acute lowering may worsen ischemia.

Table 1.
Historical and physical findings associated with hypertensive emergencies

Specific tests are indicated for all patients with suspected hypertensive emergency including a basic metabolic profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Further workup of patients with markedly elevated BP should be symptom-based and aligned with each associated condition's differential diagnosis. Figure 1 demonstrates a general approach to patients with markedly elevated BP. In a patient with altered mental status and BP > 220/120 mm Hg, the evaluation includes brain imaging by computed tomography to assess for intracerebral hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. If neither hemorrhage on computed tomography nor alternative reasons for altered mental status are present, magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted. Likewise, biomarkers of cardiac injury (troponin) and stress (natriuretic peptides) should be obtained for patients with concurrent shortness of breath or chest pain, with the addition of computed tomography angiography of the thorax and abdomen when an acute aortic syndrome is suspected.

### Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergencies in US emergency departments from 2006 to 2013 [^22ca9e65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Among the strongest epidemiological studies of hypertensive emergency are 2 recent retrospective analyses using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 9, 15 a database similar to the NEDS that includes only hospitalized patients. These studies also use ICD‐9 codes but do not include explicit requirement for coding that indicated acute target organ damage or other evidence of acuity. In the more recent analysis, Polgreen et al explored the epidemiology of hypertensive emergencies using the following specific ICD‐9 codes: malignant hypertension (401.0), hypertensive encephalopathy (437.2), and essential hypertension (401.9). In particular, they found that malignant hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy made up an increasing proportion of hospitalizations associated with any 1 of these 3 diagnoses but that overall mortality actually decreased slightly. Unlike this work, our study required ICD‐9 CM codes to indicate target organ damage. Given existing confusion about the diagnosis, where clinical evidence of acute target organ damage should be the decision point for initiating rapid BP lowering, we feel our approach is more likely to yield a clinically meaningful estimate of the true incidence of hypertensive emergency in the ED.

In addition to implications for the ED, these data also have potential bearing on how patients with markedly elevated BP should be approached in non‐ED settings, suggesting that referral to the ED for fear of a hypertensive emergency may not be necessary in the vast majority of cases. Indeed, 1 retrospective study found that patients with hypertensive urgency treated in an office setting are not any more or less likely to have a major cardiovascular event compared to patients referred to the ED or hospital. 25 Even among those actually admitted to the hospital, like those patients we defined as hypertensive emergency in the present analysis, charges for ED visits we characterized as hypertensive emergency have risen in the period from 2006 to 2013. Clarifying the epidemiology of hypertensive emergencies in the ED thus has tangible clinical relevance, especially in the context of significant morbidity and mortality in the United States from hypertension‐sensitive conditions such as heart disease and stroke. 26

### First-attack pediatric hypertensive crisis presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^b06f5667]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods of analysis

The following data were collected and analyzed: age, gender, weight, height, family history of HTN, BP on arrival to the ED, clinical manifestations of hypertensive crisis (dizziness, headache, nausea/vomiting, visual symptoms, seizure/type, altered consciousness, chest tightness/pain, target-organ damage), reversibility, anti-hypertension drugs, underlying causes (renal disease, cardiovascular (CV), essential HTN, central nervous system (CNS) factors, endocrine/metabolic disorders, oncological disease), recurrent episodes, brain imaging and duration of hospitalization (ward/intensive care unit (ICU)). In addition, to decrease the influence of age, exact BMI percentile and z-score (standard deviation score), and SBP/DBP z-score according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts were also analyzed.

CNS factors referred to CNS abnormalities as the cause of hypertension, which is different from hypertensive encephalopathy in causal connection. Essential hypertension was diagnosed after excluding secondary causes of hypertension by multiple tests, such as electrocardiography, metabolic panel, renal function tests, hemoglobin and urine routine tests, or other further specific tests including echocardiography, renal ultrasound, plasma rennin activity, plasma aldosterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and 24-hour urine free cortisol.

Case distributions of hypertensive emergency and urgency were surveyed based on different time periods. During the study period, the BP levels, etiology, severity, and clinical manifestations were compared among children by age group and compared between the patients with hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test, the Kruskal Wallis test, Jonckheere Terpstra test, and chi-square test as appropriate. The results of the descriptive analyses of independent variables were reported as percentages and mean ± S.D. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).

### The management of severe hypertension [^b756ec2c]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Although definitions of severe hypertension vary, thresholds of ≥ 160–170 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic are in most common usage. A recent focus has been placed on systolic hypertension given the increased pulse pressure in these women. In pregnancy, there is a general consensus that severe hypertension should be treated. Among woman with pre-eclampsia, attention must be paid to other end organ dysfunction, as blood pressure (BP) management is but one aspect of care. The urgency of antihypertensive therapy will depend primarily on the absolute level of BP. However, most clinicians will also consider both the rate of BP rise and the presence of maternal symptoms. Most commonly, severe hypertension is treated with parenteral labetalol or hydralazine, or oral nifedipine (capsules or PA tablet). Other options will depend on local availability. MgSO(4) should not be relied on as an antihypertensive.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension with cardiopulmonary comorbidities: is it a unique phenotype? [^bd00a45a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PAH patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities represent a unique phenotype, with distinctive clinical manifestations and treatment responses, which is different from typical PAH. They also present inconsistencies between hemodynamics and functional status from baseline to follow-up. Thus, further studies ought to concentrate on accurately identifying the phenotypes of PAH, and optimizing evaluation and treatment strategies for PAH patients with comorbidities.

### Prevalence of neurological complaints among emergency department patients with severe hypertension [^6869664f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Severe hypertension can accompany neurological symptoms without obvious signs of target organ damage. However, acute cerebrovascular events can also be a cause and consequence of severe hypertension. We therefore use US population-level data to determine prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with severe hypertension and neurological complaints.

Methods

We used nationally representative data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) collected in 2016–2019 to identify adult ED patients with severely elevated blood pressure (BP) defined as systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg. We used ED reason for visit data fields to define neurological complaints and used diagnosis data fields to define acute target organ damage. We applied survey visit weights to obtain national estimates.

Results

Based on 5083 observations, an estimated 40.4 million patients (95% CI: 37.5–43.0 million) in EDs nationwide from 2016 to 2019 had severe hypertension, equating to 6.1% (95% CI: 5.7–6.5%) of all ED visits. Only 2.8% (95% CI: 2.0–3.9%) of ED patients with severe hypertension were diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular disease; hypertensive urgency was diagnosed in 92.0% (95% CI: 90.3–93.4%). Neurological complaints were frequent in both patients with (75.6%) and without (19.9%) cerebrovascular diagnoses. Hypertensive urgency patients with neurological complaints were more often older, female, had prior stroke/TIA, and had neuroimaging than patients without these complaints. Non-migraine headache and vertigo were the most common neurological complaints recorded.

Conclusion

In a nationally representative survey, one-in-sixteen ED patients had severely elevated BP and one-fifth of those patients had neurological complaints.

### Hypertensive urgency: an important aetiology of rebound hypertension [^1d83deef]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old African-American man with a history of hypertension, end-stage kidney disease (on haemodialysis) and previous cocaine misuse presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe headache and diaphoresis without other neurological or cardiovascular signs/symptoms. He checked his blood pressure at home and found it to be 230/130. It did not improve despite taking two serial doses of oral clonidine 0.3 mg. Evaluation with head CT and lumbar puncture demonstrated no acute intracranial process, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage. These symptoms started after he took Libido-Max, an over-the-counter supplement for erectile dysfunction. This supplement includes yohimbine, an α-2 antagonist, which counteracts the effects of oral clonidine, one of his routine antihypertensive medications. This led to rebound hypertension and made his hypertensive urgency resistant to oral clonidine. He was successfully treated with intravenous labetalol and his symptoms quickly resolved after lowering of his blood pressure.

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies: a single-centre experience in Northern Italy 2008–2015 [^72fd0c26]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An increasing attention is given to emergency departments (EDs) admissions for an acute and severe rise in blood pressure (BP). Data on epidemiology and treatment of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies admitted to ED are still limited. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence, clinical presentation and treatment of patients admitted for hypertensive emergencies or hypertensive urgencies.

Methods

Medical records of consecutive patients aged at least 18 years, admitted to the ED of the Spedali Civili in Brescia in 2008 and in 2015 and presenting with SBP at least 180mmHg and/or DBP at least 120mmHg were prospectively collected and analysed.

Results

The prevalence of patients admitted with acute BP rise was 2.0% (n = 1551, age 70 ± 14 years) in 2008 and 1.75% (n = 1214, age 69.7 ± 15 years) in 2015. According to the clinical presentation and the presence of acute organ damage, patients were defined hypertensive emergencies (20.4 and 15.4%, respectively, in 2008 and 2015) or as hypertensive urgencies (79.6 and 84.5%, respectively, in 2008 and 2015). SBP and DBP values were higher in patients with emergencies than in those with urgencies (BP 193 ± 15/102 ± 15 vs. 189 ± 13/96 ± 13mmHg in 2008 and 192 ± 17/98 ± 15 vs. 189 ± 12/94 ± 15mmHg in 2015, P < 0.001 for both). Among hypertensive emergencies, the different forms of organ damage were 25% acute coronary syndromes and 1% aortic dissection in both periods, 34 and 38% acute heart failure, 40 and 37% stroke.

Conclusion

Admission to the ED for hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies is still high. Diagnosis and treatment are still not appropriate and require the rapid application of recently published guidelines.

ASSESSING AND TREATING HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive emergencies classically occur in patients with systolic BP (SBP) > 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 120 mm Hg. Nevertheless, lower thresholds can be associated with hypertensive emergencies in the setting of rapid elevations from low-to-normal baseline BP. Furthermore, BP elevations > 170/100 mm Hg can cause worsening target-organ injury in select patients. Elevated BP values in isolation, no matter how high they may be, do not by themselves define a hypertensive emergency unless the patient has concomitant acute organ injury for which immediate BP lowering will modify this injury. Thus, terms such as "hypertensive crisis", which have been historically assigned to all patients with markedly elevated BP have little utility in contemporary practice. New or worsening end-organ injury occurs in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, hematologic, and renovascular systems. The most common hypertensive emergencies are stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and acute heart failure leading to pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare and poorly understood condition that may reflect direct adverse acute effects of markedly elevated BP on the brain.

Most ED patients with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg have elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. These patients have no immediate indication for rapid BP lowering. Though a common concern among ED providers, hypertensive emergency is rare in patients with elevated BP in the ED. Thus, while all hypertensive emergencies should be managed with intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy to achieve immediate BP reduction, few patients require such intervention. Beyond hypertensive emergency, IV antihypertensive therapy is only indicated for select patients with strict oral medication restrictions and patients abruptly withdrawing from beta-blockade or sympatholytic therapy. These latter patients may benefit from IV labetalol. Given the aforementioned variability in clinical practice, it is not surprising that the majority of IV medications given to achieve immediate BP reduction in the ED are done so inappropriately to patients without new or worsening end-organ injury that can be modified by rapid treatment.

### Hypertensive crisis… [^16523261]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive crisis is a medical emergency requiring early, expert, and intensive treatment. It is a life-threatening disorder characterized by acute or severe elevation of blood pressure and by clinical manifestations secondary to the hypertension and to associated arteriolar spasm or damage. The clinical manifestations may include encephalopathy, neuroretinitis, evidences of rapidly advancing renal impairment, and acute heart failure. A number of diseases can be associated with hypertensive crisis, the most common being the accelerated or malignant phase of essential hypertension. Renal diseases, such as acute and chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, collagen vascular disease, and renovascular hypertension also are frequent causes. Sudden elevations of blood pressure which may not be sustained but are severe enough to be lifethreatening can occur in patients with pheochromocytoma.

In patients receiving treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a hypertensive crisis is precipitated by administration of sympathomimetic drugs, such as ephedrine or amphetamines, or by ingestion of. Freis ED. Hypertensive Crisis. JAMA. 1969; 208: 338–342.

### Severely increased blood pressure in the emergency department [^26aad94c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

Emergency department scope and population — Asymptomatic elevated blood pressure: This guideline is intended for physicians working in EDs and applies to patients aged 18 years or older who present to the ED with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure without signs and symptoms of acute target organ injury. It excludes patients with signs or symptoms of acute hypertensive emergencies (eg, acute stroke, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure), as well as pregnant patients, those with end-stage renal insufficiency, emergent conditions likely to cause elevated blood pressure more directly related to acute target organ injury (eg, trauma, other pain syndromes), and acute presentations of serious medical conditions associated with hypertension such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^a3f592a1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review of HU, the optimal choice of antihypertensive agent remains unclear (level 2B). Many agents demonstrated blood pressure-lowering benefit: captopril, labetalol, clonidine, amlodipine, verapamil, nitrendipine, isradipine, nifedipine, nitroglycerin, hydralazine, chlorthalidone, furosemide, diazoxide, nitroprusside, and fenoldopam. Other drugs that lowered blood pressure but are unavailable in the U.S. include lacidipine, ketanserin, and urapidil. Clinical choices in the setting of HU seemed to broaden as we conducted our extensive literature search. Side effects ranged from mild (dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, mild tachycardia, and sedation) to severe (hypotension, transient ischemic attack, uremia, and acute pulmonary edema).

Most studies limited data collection to the first few hours after initial presentation, which is not sufficient to assess morbidity and mortality. Studies were too clinically and methodologically diverse for a meta-analysis, and those that met our criteria for this systematic review included few patients. Most studies excluded patients with significant comorbidities, such as chronic kidney impairment; however, HU is a common complication in patients with associated comorbidities. In light of these factors, the generalizability of our findings is limited. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria provided only surrogate endpoint data, i.e. blood pressure lowering, and were short-term, lacking long-term morbidity and/or mortality outcomes, and providing statistical power only for differences in blood pressure lowering.

Our comprehensive systematic review regarding treatment of outpatient HU includes office and ER settings, limiting data to short-term observations of blood pressure (less than 24 h). This review also included studies based on blood pressure cut-offs, allowing us to distinguish studies that were mislabeled as urgencies or emergencies.

### Are the classical symptoms of hypertension in children still sensitive enough? [^839ab375]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The available literature is scarce on the initial symptoms of arterial hypertension in children. Our study aimed to analyze the initial clinical profile of patients referred to the hospital with suspected hypertension and those diagnosed with hypertension for the first time during a hospitalization for other reasons. This study was a retrospective analysis of medical records in 471 patients. More than half of the patients showed no symptoms. The most common symptom reported was a headache-28% (132) of patients. The diagnosis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension was more frequent in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.001). Headaches were seen more often in healthy patients than in patients with hypertension. Newly diagnosed hypertension is mainly diagnosed in asymptomatic children. Moreover, the symptoms previously described in the literature as the most common did not prove to be predictive of hypertension in our study.

Identification of hypertension

HTN in children more than 12 months of age was defined according to BP standards based on gender, age and height as stipulated in the updated classification of hypertension by the National Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension in Children and Adolescents. HTN was identified when the SBP or DBP was greater than or equal to the 95 th percentile; stage 1 HTN was defined as an SBP or DBP within the range of the 95 th percentile to the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg; stage 2 HTN was an SBP or DBP greater than the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg. For the patients younger than 12 months of age, hypertension was defined as an SBP or DBP greater than the 95 th percentile for infants of a similar age, size and sex according to a previously published report. When systolic and diastolic percentiles differed, they were categorized according to the higher value. Transient HTN means transient blood pressure elevation caused by any emotional, painful, or uncomfortable events, and was defined as an asymptomatic BP higher than the 95 th percentile only once or twice, but returning to less than the 95 th percentile on the second or third measurement without any antihypertensive medication.

A hypertensive emergency was defined as HTN in the presence of acute or ongoing target-organ lesions, or HTN in relation to an immediate life-threatening event requiring immediate intervention to reduce the BP. Hypertensive urgency was defined as an elevation in SBP/DBP higher than the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg with any complication related to the HTN and no evidence of target-organ lesions. End organ damage was defined as impairment in renal, myocardial, hepatic, and hematologic functions, and neurological manifestations derived from HTN. Acute (transient) end organ damage resulting from HTN was identified by abnormal clinical and laboratory findings which subsided after a decrease in BP. Abnormal data included abnormal electrocardiography findings, impaired renal function tests, elevated liver function markers, and neurological manifestations such as headache, altered consciousness and dizziness.

Hypertensive encephalopathy is a specific clinical syndrome characterized by acute neurological change in the setting of sudden and/or prolonged HTN that overcomes the autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral vasculature. The syndrome is defined as severe hypertension in conjunction with symptoms of headache, altered mental status, seizure, or visual disturbances, and commonly presents with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy seen on T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance images.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^5bb7d0da]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

Pathogenesis and Clinical Presentation of Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is a potentially severe hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by new‐onset maternal hypertension diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation with associated end‐organ damage involving 1 or more organ systems. The clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic hypertension to critical hypertensive emergencies with organ injury and circulatory compromise. Across this spectrum, patients can be broadly classified by disease severity into an early‐ and a late‐onset manifestation of preeclampsia. Patients who present early in pregnancy (< 34 weeks of gestation) typically exhibit a more severe clinical phenotype that involves a higher degree of placental dysfunction and associated fetal growth restriction (FGR). Abnormal placentation is hypothesized to be one of the main pathways that underlies the pathogenesis of early‐onset preeclampsia, mediating the elevation of antiangiogenic sFlt‐1 (soluble fms‐like tyrosine kinase‐1) protein and the suppression of proangiogenic PlGF protein. These endocrine changes interfere with systemic maternal vascular function and mediate transient renal injury with proteinuria. Patients who present with preeclampsia later in pregnancy (≥ 34 weeks of gestation) typically exhibit a less severe clinical phenotype and mild placental involvement that is undetectable prenatally. The development of late‐onset preeclampsia is by contrast predominantly associated with underlying maternal constitutional factors, including preexisting abnormalities of cardiovascular function. In broad terms, the pragmatic clinical division between early‐ and late‐onset preeclampsia based on a gestational age cutoff of 34 weeks distinguishes a minority of patients with severe placental dysfunction and growth restricted fetuses from the majority of patients with generally adequate placental function who have appropriately grown healthy fetuses. Optimization of maternal prepregnancy hemodynamics through exercise or other strategies has been suggested as a potentially effective intervention to prevent preeclampsia and improve pregnancy outcomes.

It would be of great clinical interest to develop a more thorough understanding of the relative importance of prepregnancy cardiovascular function in comparison with factors arising during pregnancy, especially the importance of placental diseases, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Previous research has suggested that an altered prepregnancy hemodynamic phenotype in healthy women aspiring to conceive is associated with the development of preeclampsia and FGR in the subsequent pregnancy.

Although these tend to be the classic presentations, the timing of preeclampsia diagnosis is not always synonymous with clinical severity or typical maternal and fetal phenotypes. Common maternal risk factors, including moderate obesity, chronic hypertension, and renal disease, may exert important influences on prepregnancy maternal cardiovascular and metabolic health and therefore also affect the clinical presentation, severity, and pregnancy outcomes of women destined to develop preeclampsia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — definition, risks, and approach to severe hypertension without target organ damage: Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in BP (≥ 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of acute target organ damage, and patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of BP to prevent or limit further target organ damage, but rapid correction to normal range may result in vital organ hypoperfusion due to loss of autoregulation. In contrast, patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy, and reinitiation or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients; additionally, there is no RCT evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with hypertensive emergencies.

### Assessing outcomes to determine whether symptoms related to hypertension justify renal artery stenting [^df66a202]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of the study was to determine the blood pressure (BP) response to renal artery stenting (RAS) for patients with hypertension urgency, hypertension emergency, and angina with congestive heart failure (angina/congestive heart failure [CHF]).

Methods

Patients who underwent RAS for hypertension emergencies (n = 13), hypertension urgencies (n = 25), and angina/CHF (n = 14) were included in the analysis. By convention, hypertension urgency was defined by a sustained systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 120 mm Hg, while the definition of hypertension emergency required the same BP parameters plus hypertension-related symptoms prompting hospitalization. Patient-specific response to RAS was defined according to modified American Heart Association reporting guidelines.

Results

The study cohort of 52 patients had a median age of 66 years (interquartile range 58–72). The BP response to RAS varied significantly according to the indication for RAS. Hypertension emergency provided the highest BP response rate (85%), while the response rate was significantly lower for hypertension urgency (52%) and angina/CHF (7%; P = 0.03). Only 1 of 14 patients with angina/CHF was a BP responder. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension urgency or emergency were not independent predictors of BP response to RAS. Instead, the only independent predictor of a favorable BP response was the number of preoperative antihypertensive medications (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval 2.5–22.9; P = 0.0004), which is another indicator of the severity of hypertension. Angina/CHF was an independent predictor of failure to respond to RAS (odds ratio 118.6; 95% confidence interval 2.8–999.9; P = 0.013).

Conclusions

Hypertension urgency and emergency are clinical manifestations of severe hypertension, but the number of preoperative antihypertensive medications proved to be a better predictor of a favorable BP response to RAS. In contrast, angina/CHF was a predictor of failure to respond to stenting, providing further evidence against the practice of incidental stenting during coronary interventions.

Hypertensive emergency BP-lowering targets — compelling condition versus no compelling condition: For adults with a hypertensive emergency related to a compelling condition, systolic BP (SBP) should be reduced to < 140 mm Hg for most conditions and to < 120 mm Hg in acute aortic dissection during the first hour while monitoring for other target organ dysfunction (1 C-LD). For adults with a hypertensive emergency but without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than 25% within the first hour, then if stable to < 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours, and then cautiously to 130 to 140 mm Hg during the next 24 to 48 hours to limit target organ injury (1 C-LD). Hypertensive emergencies in patients with acute ICH or acute ischemic stroke and in pregnant adults are addressed in separate sections.

### Drug nonadherence is a common but often overlooked cause of hypertensive urgency and emergency at the emergency department [^b16c25bb]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Over 70% of patients who visit the emergency department with a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency have previously been diagnosed with hypertension. Drug nonadherence is assumed to play an important role in development of hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency, but exact numbers are lacking. We aimed to retrospectively compare characteristics of patients with hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency and to prospectively quantify the attribution of drug nonadherence.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed clinical data including information on nonadherence obtained by treating physicians of patients with SBP at least 180mmHg and DBP at least 110mmHg visiting the emergency department between 2012 and 2015. We prospectively studied drug adherence among patients admitted to the emergency department with severely elevated BP by measuring plasma drug levels using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry from September 2016 to March 2017.

Results

Of the 1163 patients retrospectively analysed, 257 (22.0%) met the criteria for hypertensive urgency and 356 (30.6%) for hypertensive emergency. Mean SBP (SD) was 203 (19) mmHg and mean DBP 121 (12) mmHg. Mean age was 60.1 (14.6) years; 55.1% were men. In 6.3% of patients with hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency, nonadherence was recorded as an attributing factor. Of the 59 patients prospectively analysed, 18 (30.5%) were nonadherent for at least one of the prescribed antihypertensive drugs.

Conclusion

Hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency are common health problems resulting in frequent emergency department admissions. Workup of patients with a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency should include an assessment of drug adherence to optimize treatment strategy.

### Characteristics, practice patterns, and outcomes in patients with acute hypertension: European registry for studying the treatment of acute hyperTension (euro-STAT) [^7d06f99c]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to have hypertension, which increases their risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and organ injury. One percent of all hypertensive patients experience at least one episode of acute, severe hypertension, necessitating intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy and placing these patients at risk of overt, acute end-organ damage over their lifetime. The actual prevalence may in fact be much higher. One-fourth of patients who present to busy emergency departments (EDs) have acute, severe hypertension. In the present study, we defined this population by using a pragmatic approach according to whether the treating physicians decided to use IV antihypertensive therapy.

Multiple effective strategies are used for the management of chronic hypertension, but less is known about treating patients who present with acute, severe elevations in arterial blood pressure (BP). The optimal target for BP lowering has yet to be defined; the definitions of hypertensive urgencies, emergencies and outcome measures lack uniformity; evidence supporting the use of one drug over another is lacking; and whether certain treatments are better than others is unknown. As a consequence, treatment practices vary. The European registry for Studying the Treatment of Acute hyperTension (Euro-STAT) was conducted to evaluate 'real-life' management practices and outcomes in patients treated with IV antihypertensive therapy for an episode of acute hypertension.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies in nonpregnant, nonstroke adults — definition and ICU admission: Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in blood pressure (BP) (≥ 180/120 mm Hg) with evidence of acute target organ damage. For these patients, admission to an intensive care unit is recommended for continuous monitoring of BP and target organ damage, with this recommendation categorized as 1 B-NR.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^555ad6c8]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Transition to adult care in adolescent hypertension: Adolescents with elevated BP or HTN (whether they are receiving antihypertensive treatment) should typically have their care transitioned to an appropriate adult care provider by 22 years of age (recognizing that there may be individual cases in which this upper age limit is exceeded, particularly in the case of youth with special health care needs). There should be a transfer of information regarding HTN etiology and past manifestations and complications of the patient's HTN (grade X, strong recommendation).

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies: a preliminary report of the ongoing Italian multicentric study ERIDANO [^7cab15f2]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive urgencies (HU) and hypertensive emergencies (HE) are challenges for the Emergency Department (ED). A prospective multicentre study is ongoing to characterize patients with acute hypertensive disorders, prevalence of subclinical hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), short- and long-term prognosis; this is a preliminary report. Patients admitted to the ED with symptomatic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180/110mmHg were enrolled. They were managed by ED personnel according to their clinical presentations. Subsequently they underwent clinical evaluation and subclinical HMOD assessment at a Hypertension Centre within 72h from enrolment. 122 patients were included in this report. Mean age was 60.7 ± 13.9 years, 52.5% were females. 18 (14.8%) patients were diagnosed with HE, 108 (88.5%) with HU. There were no differences in gender, BMI, and cardiovascular comorbidities between groups. At ED discharge, 66.7% and 93.6% (p = 0.003) of HE and HU patients, respectively, had BP < 180/110mmHg. After 72h, 34.4% of patients resulted normotensive; 35.2%, 22.1%, and 8.2% had hypertension grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Patients with uncontrolled BP at office evaluation had higher vascular HMOD (49.1 vs. 25.9%, p = 0.045). Cardiac (60 vs. 34%, p = 0.049), renal (27.8 vs. 9.6%, p = 0.010) and cerebral (100 vs. 21%, p < 0.001) HMOD was more frequent in HE compared to HU group. HE showed greater cardiac, renal, and cerebral subclinical HMOD, compared to HU. 72-hours BP control is not associated with different HMOD, except for vascular HMOD; therefore, proper comprehensive examination after discharge from the ED could provide added value in cardiovascular risk stratification of such patients. One third of patients with acute blood pressure rise evaluated to the ED resulted normotensive at office evaluation (< 72hours after discharge). Patients with hypertensive emergency showed greater cardiac, renal, and cerebral subclinical HMOD, compared to the patients with hypertensive urgency. BP: blood pressure; HMOD: hypertension-mediated organ damage; y.o.: years old; mo.: months.

### Spontaneous iliopsoas haematoma: a complication of hypertensive urgency [^4715d68e]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Iliopsoas haematoma is a rare clinical entity which can be life threatening in extreme cases. We are reporting a case of iliopsoas haematoma as a complication of hypertensive urgency. A 67-year old woman presented to emergency room with hypertensive urgency and hip pain. During hospitalisation, her haemoglobin was decreasing and on further evaluation, she did not have any signs of external bleeding and laboratory results were not suggestive of haemolysis. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed a spontaneous iliopsoas haematoma. A likely explanation for this presentation in the absence of coagulopathy and trauma is very high blood pressure. Patient was on low-dose aspirin at home which could have further aggravated her bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. She was managed conservatively with blood transfusions and blood pressure was reduced to target after which she recovered.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.
