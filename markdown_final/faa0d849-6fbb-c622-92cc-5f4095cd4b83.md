## Question

What are the potential side effects of long-term use of Imodium A-D?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential side effects of long-term use of Imodium A-D (loperamide). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled dosing to anchor what "long-term" and "therapeutic" mean. Then, I should distinguish expected adverse effects at therapeutic doses from serious risks that emerge with supratherapeutic dosing or misuse. Next, I will review gastrointestinal, cardiac, endocrine, and CNS effects, and consider special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified conclusion and monitoring plan, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and FDA labeling as I go.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Loperamide is a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist with very low systemic bioavailability at therapeutic doses due to first-pass metabolism and P-glycoprotein efflux, which keeps CNS levels minimal. This is why it is generally non-sedating at labeled doses, but at high doses it can overwhelm efflux and produce central opioid effects and cardiotoxicity, so I need to keep that dose-dependent toxicity in mind as I proceed [^ba6806aa] [^a76e3c9d].

> I should confirm the labeled dosing because "long-term" safety depends on staying within recommended amounts. For adults with acute diarrhea, the OTC maximum is 8 mg/day; for prescription use, up to 16 mg/day is approved, and for chronic diarrhea, maintenance commonly falls in the 4–8 mg/day range. Exceeding 16 mg/day increases risk and is not recommended, so "long-term" within these bounds is the key safety frame I will use [^5f30f860] [^9aa4f697].

> Next, I will examine expected adverse effects at therapeutic doses. Wait, let me verify the frequencies. In clinical trials, common effects include constipation, abdominal cramps or distension, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness, with constipation being the most frequent and often dose-limiting; these are generally mild and self-limited, and more often reported in chronic diarrhea studies than in acute diarrhea, which aligns with clinical experience of cumulative antimotility effects over time [^888a4dca] [^23fa84ff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "safe at any dose". I need to check the serious risks that emerge with supratherapeutic use. The FDA has repeatedly warned that doses above recommended levels can cause life-threatening cardiotoxicity, including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, cardiac arrest, and death; case series show marked QTc prolongation and polymorphic VT, often requiring overdrive pacing or cardioversion, and toxicokinetic data demonstrate prolonged half-lives of loperamide and its metabolite, explaining persistent ECG abnormalities for days after cessation [^ee5ced04] [^a46f953f] [^389105cc] [^143d5d5f].

> I should confirm the mechanism behind the cardiotoxicity. Loperamide is a potent hERG channel blocker in vitro, which mechanistically explains repolarization delay and torsades risk; clinically, this risk is amplified by high doses, co-administered QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte disturbances, or congenital long QT, so I need to ensure I screen for these modifiable risks when counseling patients on long-term therapy [^68928a7f] [^ee5ced04].

> But wait, what if the patient is using loperamide to self-treat opioid withdrawal or chasing euphoria? I should double-check the abuse signal. Multiple case reports and series document misuse at 100–800 mg/day, with dependence, withdrawal, and fatal arrhythmias; poison center data show rising exposures and deaths, and expert statements emphasize recognition and linkage to addiction treatment, so I need to ask explicitly about dose escalation and intent of use in any long-term user [^f7df8bac] [^7867d597] [^ef78cbb3].

> Next, I should review endocrine effects, because even therapeutic-range dosing may rarely suppress the HPA axis. Case reports describe loperamide-induced secondary adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism with chronic use, likely via hypothalamic-pituitary opioidergic suppression; although uncommon, this can be life-threatening if unrecognized, so I need to consider it in patients with fatigue, hyponatremia, hypotension, or unexplained symptoms on chronic therapy [^670cb645] [^09a8c8d5].

> I will now examine CNS effects. At therapeutic doses, CNS penetration is minimal and sedation is uncommon, but at high doses loperamide can cross the blood–brain barrier and cause opioid-like CNS depression, respiratory depression, and even seizures; naloxone can reverse opioid effects in overdose, though repeated dosing may be needed due to loperamide's long half-life, so I should confirm dose history and consider naloxone in suspected toxicity [^ba6806aa] [^cba5bcd3].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In hepatic impairment, reduced metabolism may increase systemic exposure, so I should use caution and monitor for CNS effects. In older adults, susceptibility to QT effects is higher, so I should avoid QT-prolonging co-medications and correct electrolytes. In children under 2 years, loperamide is contraindicated due to respiratory depression and serious cardiac events, and in older children, use is generally discouraged for acute infectious diarrhea because of variable responses and risks; in short bowel syndrome, higher loperamide doses may be necessary and acceptable under specialist supervision, but even then, I should monitor for constipation and electrolyte disturbances [^c5a7230d] [^8a51ed91] [^8f9b2e58] [^c3c80314].

> I should confirm drug–drug interaction risks that amplify cardiotoxicity. Co-administration with CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors, or other QT-prolonging agents, can raise loperamide levels and arrhythmia risk; in patients who need antiarrhythmics, certain antibiotics, antipsychotics, or methadone, I need to reassess the necessity of loperamide and consider alternatives or closer ECG monitoring if it is unavoidable [^ee5ced04] [^a76e3c9d].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal risks that can emerge with chronic use. Beyond constipation, rare but serious complications include paralytic ileus, megacolon, and toxic megacolon, particularly in inflammatory diarrheas or immunocompromised hosts; I need to ensure patients stop loperamide promptly if abdominal distention, pain, or obstipation develop and avoid use when toxic megacolon is a concern [^709871e5] [^8f9b2e58].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified conclusion. At therapeutic doses within labeled limits, long-term loperamide is generally safe, with constipation and mild GI effects predominating and a very low risk of serious adverse events. However, with supratherapeutic dosing or misuse, the risks escalate to life-threatening cardiotoxicity, endocrine suppression, and opioid use disorder, so I should screen for dose escalation, concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte abnormalities, and hepatic disease, and counsel clearly to stay within 16 mg/day and seek care if palpitations, syncope, or persistent constipation occur [^888a4dca] [^ee5ced04] [^670cb645].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical monitoring and alternatives are in place. For patients requiring chronic antidiarrheal therapy, I should periodically reassess the indication, reinforce adherence to labeled dosing, review medications for QT risk, check electrolytes if diarrhea is severe or persistent, and consider non-opioid alternatives such as racecadotril where appropriate; if I suspect misuse or dependence, I should address opioid use disorder and offer evidence-based treatment rather than escalating loperamide, thereby mitigating both health risks and misuse potential [^ee5ced04] [^a54957ef] [^ef78cbb3].

Long-term use of Imodium A-D (loperamide) at **recommended doses** is generally safe, with constipation being the most common side effect [^888a4dca]. Serious risks are rare but include **toxic megacolon** in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or infectious colitis [^709871e5], and **cardiac arrhythmias** (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes) with high doses or drug interactions [^ee5ced04] [^68928a7f]. Chronic use may rarely cause **hypopituitarism** (secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism) [^670cb645] [^09a8c8d5]. Patients should stay within the maximum daily dose (16 mg) [^9aa4f697], avoid use in children under 2 years [^8a51ed91], and monitor for constipation, abdominal distension, or cardiac symptoms [^c5a7230d].

---

## Common side effects

Constipation is the **most frequent side effect** with chronic loperamide use, occurring in approximately 1–10% of patients [^23fa84ff]. Other gastrointestinal effects include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, nausea, and vomiting, which are generally mild and self-limited [^888a4dca].

---

## Serious gastrointestinal complications

- **Toxic megacolon**: Rare but life-threatening, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious colitis, or immunocompromised states. Loperamide should be discontinued immediately if abdominal distension or ileus develops [^709871e5] [^8f9b2e58].

- **Paralytic ileus**: Prolonged inhibition of intestinal motility can lead to ileus, especially with high doses or in susceptible patients [^709871e5].

---

## Cardiac side effects

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: High doses (> 16 mg/day) or drug interactions can cause significant QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, and torsades de pointes, which can be fatal [^ee5ced04] [^a46f953f].

- **Brugada syndrome**: Chronic high-dose use has been associated with Brugada-like ECG patterns and increased arrhythmic risk [^05a2c872] [^a3a5fe45].

---

## Endocrine effects

Chronic high-dose loperamide may rarely cause **hypopituitarism**, presenting as secondary adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism [^670cb645] [^09a8c8d5].

---

## Central nervous system effects

At therapeutic doses, CNS penetration is minimal; however, **high doses** can cause CNS depression, respiratory depression, and opioid-like effects due to systemic accumulation [^ba6806aa] [^a76e3c9d].

---

## Special populations and precautions

- **Pediatric patients**: Contraindicated in children under 2 years due to risk of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions [^8a51ed91] [^75d29bb0].

- **Elderly patients**: Greater susceptibility to CNS effects and QT prolongation; use with caution [^c5a7230d].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Reduced metabolism may increase systemic exposure; monitor closely [^c5a7230d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Maximum daily dose**: 16 mg/day for adults; avoid exceeding this limit due to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias [^9aa4f697] [^ee5ced04].

- **Duration of use**: Use the lowest effective dose and reassess regularly; prolonged use should be monitored by a healthcare professional [^c5a7230d].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for constipation, abdominal distension, signs of ileus, and cardiac symptoms (palpitations, syncope) [^c5a7230d].

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

### Loperamide abuse cardiotoxicity. should loperamide still be an over the counter medication? [^44352286]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that is inexpensive, easily accessible, and widely used. It is generally thought to be safe and effective without the potential for abuse. However, recent discovery of its ability to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms at high doses has led to not only its abuse, but also the need to recognize its cardiotoxicity due to the ability to prolong the QTc interval. We report a case of a 33 year old female with a history of opioid dependence who presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath and generalized weakness who was subsequently found to be in ventricular tachycardia. Electrocardiogram showed prolongation of the QTc and the patient later admitted to ingestion of 70 loperamide pills daily for the past year in order to alleviate her opioid withdrawal symptoms. Due to increased loperamide abuse and toxicity displayed within the last several years, public and health provider awareness should be optimized to fully understand its lethality, and stricter regulations on its availability to the general population should be considered. Even in asymptomatic patients with ECG abnormalities, emergency medicine physicians should admit them for further monitoring and aggressive medical therapy.

### Loperamide-induced hypopituitarism [^09a8c8d5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Loperamide, a phenylpiperidine derivative and a potent opioid μ-receptor agonist, is the most commonly used antidiarrhoeal medication in the UK. About 1.79 million prescriptions were issued in 2014and it is also freely available 'over the counter'. Its popularity persists due to a combination of favourable efficacy and a reasonably limited side effect profile; predictable gastrointestinal side effects do occur, but it is widely considered to be a very safe and well-tolerated medication.

Loperamide is directly absorbed into the gut wall, exerting its effect on the myenteric plexus to reduce propulsive activity and increase intestinal transit time. Although gastrointestinal tract absorption is favourable, it is rapidly extracted by hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism resulting in low levels in the systemic circulation (bioavailability < 2%). While extensively used in acute diarrhoea, a significant proportion of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disease take loperamide on a daily basis, often at relatively high doses. Prior studies have paid scant attention to the potential adverse effects of longer term ingestion.

We report a serious and hitherto undocumented adverse effect of chronic loperamide use following presentation to the endocrine clinic.

### Clinical review: loperamide toxicity [^698ffc4e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid widely used for the treatment of diarrhea. Although it is relatively safe at therapeutic doses, increasing reports describe its misuse and abuse at very high doses either for euphoric effects or to attenuate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Life-threatening loperamide toxicity can result from the relatively new clinical syndrome of loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity. These patients are often young and may present in cardiac arrest or with unheralded, recurrent syncope in conjunction with ECG abnormalities, including marked QT-interval prolongation, QRS-interval widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias. Features of conventional opioid toxicity may also be present. The mainstays of treatment include advanced cardiac life support and supportive care, although selected patients may be candidates for overdrive pacing, intravenous lipid emulsion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients who survive loperamide toxicity, consideration should be given to the treatment of an underlying opioid use disorder, if present.

Management

Loperamide non-cardiac arrhythmia overdosages should be treated as opioid overdosages. Naloxone may reverse the opioid-related toxicity, including CNS and respiratory depression, and hypotension, associated with loperamide overdosage.

In adults and pediatric patients, naloxone may be administered intravenously. Appropriate doses of naloxone, via intranasal, intramuscular, intraosseus, or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. If the desired degree of opioid-related toxicity counteraction and improvement are not obtained, naloxone may be repeated at two- to three-minute intervals. If no response in opioid-related effects is observed after naloxone has been administered, then diagnosis of opioid-induced toxicity should be questioned.

Refer to the naloxone prescribing information for complete information on initial and subsequent dosages.

For patients whose adverse reactions are responsive to naloxone, monitor vital signs, neurologic and cardiopulmonary status for recurrence of opioid overdose symptoms for at least 24 hours after the last dose of naloxone, due to the prolonged intestinal retention of loperamide and the short duration (one to three hours) of naloxone. Patients with severe CNS or respiratory depression, and those who require multiple doses of naloxone to reverse symptoms, should be admitted to the hospital and may require intensive care.

Laboratory Testing

Standard drug screens for opioids do not include an assay for loperamide; such testing for opioids will yield negative results even in the presence of loperamide.

### Increased risk for ESBL-producing bacteria from Co-administration of loperamide and antimicrobial drugs for travelers' diarrhea [^08f5cfbb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Loperamide, a drug with both antisecretory and antimotility effects, is widely used by travelers. Although mostly used alone, loperamide is sometimes used with AMDs; the combination stops symptoms faster than AMDs alone during the first 2 days of TD. After that, the combination no longer appears advantageous, probably because symptoms resolve naturally. Using loperamide with AMDs is presented as a safe option in general guidelines published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the effects of co-administration on the risk for ESBL-E acquisition have not been addressed.

Some researchers have posed the question as to whether the antimotility effect of loperamide, involving prolonged passage through the gastrointestinal tract, would, in fact, increase the risk for colonization (data not shown). Such speculations prompted us to revisit our recent data to compare loperamide, AMDs, and their combination in the treatment of TD with regard to the risk for contracting travel-acquired ESBL-E.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of loperamide hydrochloride PO:
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: use caution when using high doses of loperamide and pre-existing cardiac disease.

### Loperamide-induced cardiotoxicity: a case overlooked? [^2942c945]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A young man presented to the emergency department with seizures and recurrent episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT)/torsades de pointes (TdP) requiring cardioversion and administration of intravenous magnesium. A battery of tests performed to identify a cause for his arrhythmias and seizures were all normal. A revisit of history with family revealed he had consumed over 100 tablets/day of loperamide for the past 1year. A prolonged QT interval on his ECG raised concerns for long QT syndrome (LQTS) (congenital or acquired). Our patient was suspected to have loperamide-induced cardiotoxicity. TdP is a specific PMVT that occurs with a prolonged QT interval and is usually drug-induced. Less frequently, congenital LQTS may be implicated. With supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and temporary transvenous overdrive pacing, our patient recovered completely. We describe the importance of a systematic and time-sensitive approach to diagnosing critical illness. Loperamide overdose may cause QT prolongation, life-threatening arrhythmias/cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest. Seizures/epilepsy may also be a manifestation in young patients. There is a substantial need to revisit the safety of over-the-counter medications and increasing awareness of manifestations of drug overdose.

### Loperamide metabolite-induced cardiomyopathy and QTc prolongation [^89a9fe20]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter, peripherally acting, μ-opioid receptor agonist used for the treatment of diarrhea. In recent times users have found that at higher doses, loperamide crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches central μ-receptors in the brain, leading to central opiate effects including euphoria and respiratory depression. We report a case of a 37-year-old female who attempted suicide with over 200 loperamide tablets. During her overdose, her QTc was significantly prolonged at > 600ms. Our case aims to add to the growing body of literature describing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with loperamide toxicity and further suggests that a metabolite of loperamide, desmethylloperamide, may play a role in the pathogenesis.

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^f3878369]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.

### Loperamide abuse and dependence: clinical features and treatment considerations [^af5d1be7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder and its associated mortality have become national epidemic problems. Different measures and regulations have been implemented to curb this trend, including stricter opioid prescribing practice. With the decreased access to prescription opioids, individuals with opioid use disorder have explored alternatives including loperamide, a peripheral opioid mu-receptor agonist. There are reports of increased loperamide misuse, dependence, and mortality rate in the past few years from poison control centers, medical examiners' offices, and clinical settings. Here, we report a case of loperamide use disorder, which led to the death of the patient. Associated clinical features and treatment of loperamide use disorder, including management of intoxication and withdrawal, and long-term maintenance therapy are discussed along with potential prescribing and sale regulations to manage this newly emerging substance use disorder.

### Loperamide abuse associated with cardiac dysrhythmia and Death [^9f6b8ebe]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal with μ-opioid agonist activity. Central nervous system opioid effects are not observed after therapeutic oral dosing because of poor bioavailability and minimal central nervous system penetration. However, central nervous system opioid effects do occur after supratherapeutic oral doses. Recently, oral loperamide abuse as an opioid substitute has been increasing among patients attempting to self-treat their opioid addiction. Ventricular dysrhythmias and prolongation of the QRS duration and QTc interval have been reported after oral loperamide abuse. We describe 2 fatalities in the setting of significantly elevated loperamide concentrations.

### Loperamide misuse to avoid opioid withdrawal and to achieve a euphoric effect: high doses and high risk [^0854d634]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Loperamide is a readily accessible nonprescription medication that is increasingly being used surreptitiously as an opioid substitute to alleviate the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with loperamide misuse and toxicity.

Methods

The ToxIC registry, a nationwide, prospectively collected cohort of patients evaluated by medical toxicologists was searched from November 2011-December 2016 for patients with loperamide exposure. Each record was reviewed to determine the circumstances, dose, clinical presentations, treatment, and outcomes associated with loperamide use.

Results

Twenty-six cases were identified, and both the absolute number and relative proportion of overall cases in the ToxIC registry increased annually. The median age was 27 and 54% were male. Of cases with known intent (n = 18), 12(67%) were misuse/abuse, 3(17%) were self-harm/suicide, and 3(17%) were pediatric exploratory ingestions. Circumstances for misuse included taking higher doses than labeled (n = 7), avoiding withdrawal (n = 6), and gaining a pleasurable sensation (n = 4). The dose was reported in nine cases and ranged from 4mg to 400mg. In patients seeking to avoid withdrawal doses were 160-400mg/day; the most common reported dose was 200mg. Reported ECG abnormalities included 10 cases of prolonged QTc (> 500ms), which consisted of misuse/abuse (n = 6) and self-harm (n = 1) exposures; six prolonged QRS (> 120ms); two first degree AV block; seven ventricular dysrhythmias, five of which were single-agent exposures. All but one ECG demonstrated prolonged QTc with a range of 566-749ms. All patients with dysrhythmias in which dose were reported ingested ≥ 200mg.

Conclusions

The majority of patients had loperamide toxicity due to misuse/abuse, in-line with national trends. In patients avoiding withdrawal, doses > 100mg were observed. When taken in large doses (> 200mg), loperamide may cause significant cardiovascular effects, including QTc-prolongation and ventricular dysrhythmias.

OVERDOSAGE

The use of higher than recommended loperamide hydrochloride doses may result in life-threatening cardiac, CNS and respiratory adverse reactions.

If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

Cardiac Effects

 Symptoms

Cases of overdosage with loperamide hydrochloride (chronic ingestion of doses ranging from 70 mg to 1600 mg daily; 4 to 100 times the recommended dose) have resulted in life-threatening cardiac adverse reactions, including QT/QTc and QRS interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, Brugada syndrome and other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases include patients who were abusing (using supratherapeutic doses in place of opioids to induce euphoria) or misusing (taking higher than recommended doses to control diarrhea or to prevent opioid withdrawal) loperamide. The following are representative cases that included cardiac adverse reactions:

25 year old abused loperamide and presented to the hospital on multiple occasions with symptoms of syncope, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotensive shock. The patient also experienced ventricular tachycardia, a prolonged QTc of 527 ms and QRS interval of 170 ms, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and subsequent cardiac arrest and death (elevated loperamide blood concentration of 32 ng/ml).
54 year old misused loperamide hydrochloride (up to 144 mg per day) as a self-treatment for chronic diarrhea for over 2 years. Signs of cardiac toxicity included syncope, prolonged QT of 500 ms sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which required cardioversion and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) management.
26 year old, with prior opioid abuse, presented to the hospital with recurrent syncope and developed Torsades de Pointes requiring electrical cardioversion. An ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 85 bpm and a markedly prolonged QTc interval of greater than 700 ms. The patient reported ingesting 100 to 250 mg of loperamide hydrochloride with 400 mg of cimetidine daily for several months to simulate the euphoric sensation associated with opioids.

### Methadone management of withdrawal associated with loperamide-related opioid use disorder [^224885a7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide hydrochloride is an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal agent, acting via mu-opioid receptor agonist effects in the intestinal myenteric plexus. Although preclinical investigations suggested that abuse liability associated with loperamide use is low, there are increasing numbers of cases reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, of abuse, dependence, and withdrawal associated with loperamide use. A case of a patient with opioid use disorder, that is, in the form of protracted loperamide excess use, requiring management of withdrawal with methadone is presented. Management of withdrawal from abrupt loperamide discontinuation has not been discussed in the literature. Long-term treatment issues are also described.

### Dysrhythmias with loperamide used for opioid withdrawal [^c19dad09]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The antidiarrheal loperamide has had a recent, drastic increase in off-label use as an alternative treatment for symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The concept of this is easily discovered on the Internet and social media, where there are multiple blogs and forums promoting loperamide use at doses of 70 to 200 mg per day. Unfortunately, the serious side effects are not well recognized. Multiple cases of cardiac dysrhythmias contributing to death have been highlighted in recent literature. In November 2016, the US Food & Drug Administration released a statement highlighting the potential heart effects and risk of death with high doses of loperamide. 1 This case regards a 22-year-old who took 200 mg of loperamide per day for 2 years as an alternative to methadone in her attempts to wean off heroin. Her subsequent spontaneous collapse, dysrhythmias, and acute hospital treatment are reviewed in detail as they were contradictory to standard therapy and required a multidisciplinary approach. Her outpatient management addressed the complex biological, psychological, and social aspects of her addiction.

### Epidemiologic trends in loperamide abuse and Misuse [^7867d597]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Loperamide abuse has been increasing in the United States as a potential alternative to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use. In June 2016, the Food and Drug Administration warned health care providers and the general public about potential serious adverse outcomes, including cardiac dysrhythmias and death. The purpose of this study is to determine recent trends in intentional loperamide abuse and misuse, reported clinical effects and management, and medical outcomes as reported to poison centers across the United States.

Methods

Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System indicating intentional misuse, abuse, and suspected suicide between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, were assessed. Demographic and temporal trends, as well as reported clinical effects, medical management, and health outcomes, were analyzed.

Results

There was a 91% increase in reported exposures from 2010 to 2015, of which half were single-agent loperamide use only. Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System increased at approximately 38 cases per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5 to 42.9; P < 0.0001). Fifteen deaths were reported during this time frame, of which 8 involved single-agent loperamide abuse.

Conclusion

Loperamide abuse and misuse are projected to increase in the absence of any methods to reduce exposure or curb abuse. Health care providers should consider the potential for loperamide toxicity when managing patients with opioidlike toxicity.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Adverse Reactions, Including Torsades de Pointes and Sudden Death

Cases of prolongation of the QT/QTc interval, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, some resulting in death, have been reported in adults with use of higher than recommended doses per day of loperamide hydrochloride. Cases include patients who were abusing or misusing loperamide hydrochloride (see OVERDOSAGE and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Cases of syncope and ventricular tachycardia have been reported in adult patients receiving the recommended dosage of loperamide hydrochloride capsules. Some of these patients were taking other drugs or had other risk factors that may have increased their risk of cardiac adverse reactions. Additionally, postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age.

Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, OVERDOSAGE).

Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in:

combination with others drugs or herbal products that are known to prolong the QT interval, including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), or any other drug known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone)
patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, including patients with congenital long QT syndrome, with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions, elderly patients and those with electrolyte abnormalities.

### Electrocardiographic changes in loperamide toxicity: case report and review of literature [^389105cc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Loperamide, an antidiarrheal agent, is a µ-opioid receptor agonist increasingly abused to prevent opioid withdrawal or to produce euphoric effects. At supra-therapeutic doses, loperamide can cause cardiac toxicity due to blockade of Na and I Kr channels, resulting in wide QRS rhythms, severe bradycardia, prolonged QTc, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and death. There are limited data on the cardiotoxic effects of high dose loperamide.

Methods and Results

A case report of loperamide toxicity is presented and then added to a contemporary review of the literature. In total, the presentation and management of 36 cases of loperamide cardiotoxicity are summarized. The overall median daily dose (interquartile range) of loperamide was 200 (134–400)mg. The median QRS duration was 160 (125–170)ms. The median QTc duration was 620 (565–701)ms. Ventricular tachycardia was experienced by 24/36 (67%) of patients, 20 of which were specified to be polymorphic. Treatment was supportive, providing advanced cardiopulmonary life support and aggressive electrolyte repletion. Isoproterenol infusion or overdrive pacing was employed in 19/36 (53%) of cases. The median time to electrocardiogram normalization or hospital discharge, whichever came first, was 5 (3.5–10) days.

Conclusion

Loperamide overdose is a toxidrome that remains underrecognized, and in patients with unexplained cardiac arrhythmias, loperamide toxicity should be suspected. Prompt recognition is critical due to the delayed recovery and high risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.

OVERDOSAGE

In cases of overdosage, (including relative overdose due to hepatic dysfunction), urinary retention, paralytic ileus and CNS depression may occur. Children may be more sensitive to CNS effects than adults. Clinical trials have demonstrated that a slurry of activated charcoal administered promptly after ingestion of loperamide hydrochloride can reduce the amount of drug which is absorbed into the systemic circulation by as much as ninefold. If vomiting occurs spontaneously upon ingestion, a slurry of 100 gms of activated charcoal should be administered orally as soon as fluids can be retained.

If vomiting has not occurred, gastric lavage should be performed followed by administration of 100 gms of the activated charcoal slurry through the gastric tube. In the event of overdosage, patients should be monitored for signs of CNS depression for at least 24 hours.

If symptoms of overdose occur, naloxone can be given as an antidote. If responsive to naloxone, vital signs must be monitored carefully for recurrence of symptoms of drug overdose for at least 24 hours after the last dose of naloxone.

In view of the prolonged action of loperamide and the short duration (one to three hours) of naloxone, the patient must be monitored closely and treated repeatedly with naloxone as indicated. Since relatively little drug is excreted in the urine, forced diuresis is not expected to be effective for IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) overdosage.

In clinical trials an adult who took three 20mg doses within a 24 hour period was nauseated after the second dose and vomited after the third dose. In studies designed to examine the potential for side effects, intentional ingestion of up to 60 mg of loperamide hydrochloride in a single dose to healthy subjects resulted in no significant adverse effects.

Chronic Diarrhea

Adults

The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of loperamide hydrochloride capsules should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules per day). The maximum daily dosage is 16 mg (eight capsules per day). If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Loperamide hydrochloride capsules administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.

Elderly

No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects. However, there were no major differences reported in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. No dose adjustment is required for the elderly.

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see WARNINGS).

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Use loperamide hydrochloride with caution in such patients because the systemic exposure may be increased due to reduced metabolism (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Loperamide dependence and abuse [^f7df8bac]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Loperamide is a common over-the-counter antidiarrheal considered safe in a broad range of dosages and thought devoid of abuse potential. We describe the first case of a patient with loperamide dependence due to misuse of its opiate-like effects achieved by chronic massive oral ingestions. A 26-year-old man who was taking 800mg of loperamide per day presented requesting detoxification referral. Loperamide has potential for euphoric effects and information on how to facilitate such effects is easily available. It is important for physicians to be aware of the potential for misuse of and dependence on loperamide, with symptoms mimicking opiate use.

### Increased risk for ESBL-producing bacteria from Co-administration of loperamide and antimicrobial drugs for travelers' diarrhea [^c6871b06]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In the group taking both loperamide and AMDs, the colonization rate was strikingly high, increasing from 21% (LO–AB–) to 71% (LO+AB+). The rate also appeared to exceed the risk for using AMDs alone (40%), yet the interaction term of loperamide and AMDs did not reach statistical significance (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 0.6–16.6), and the small subject number resulted in wide CIs. Theoretically, an additional increase in the risk seen in the combination group could be brought about by loperamide: because of its antimotility effect, contact time of the AMD to the gut lumen is increased, and the selection pressure posed by the AMD may be prolonged, thus intensifying its unfavorable effects.

Our study design was limited by not including a randomized allocation of therapy and the varied use of loperamide according to symptoms. However, no association was seen between the severity of symptoms and acquisition of ESBL-E (data not shown).

Studies are needed to compare the relative risk posed by various AMD classes. Exploration of the influence of nonantimicrobial antidiarrheal agents with only antisecretory effect, such as racecadotril, as monotherapy and in combination with AMDs would also be beneficial.

### Loperamide-associated opioid use disorder and proposal of an alternative treatment with buprenorphine [^b81e5d81]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This case report describes a patient with opioid use disorder who developed cardiac toxicity secondary to non-medical use of loperamide. At recommended doses, loperamide remains in the periphery to treat diarrhea. At high doses, loperamide causes central nervous system (CNS) opioid agonism. Complications of high-dose loperamide have been documented, including cardiotoxicity, and death. This is particularly important in light of the ongoing opioid epidemic. This case presents a patient with sequela of high-dose loperamide as an illicit opioid replacement and the subsequent loperamide toxicity, including significant QTc prolongation. Abrupt cessation of his high-dose loperamide use resulted in opioid withdrawal symptoms, which were treated with buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was selected to avoid possible worsening of QTc secondary to an additional medication, such as methadone. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of buprenorphine for treatment of loperamide-associated opioid use disorder. Non-medical use of loperamide requires increased recognition by the health care community, including both physicians and pharmacists, because it can result in marked and life-threatening toxicity.

### Optimizing abemaciclib-induced diarrhea management in patients with breast cancer: a pragmatic 2-group study using a postbiotic microbiota stabilizer [^fe29d5f0]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the reduced severity of diarrhea in the Postbio group translated into the possibility of administering abemaciclib with a diminished need for dose reduction, temporary suspension, or permanent discontinuation. Alternatively, nowadays it is possible to maintain a patient on a CDK4/6i-based treatment by the utilization of alternative CDK4/6 inhibitors that are devoid of dose-limiting AEs (ie, diarrhea in the case of abemaciclib), such as ribociclib or palbociclib. In the absence of effective preventive or management strategies of diarrhea, the switch to another CDK4/6i could be considered as a strategy to mitigate the incidence of diarrhea toxicity in patients undergoing this type of treatment.

The study design implemented postbiotic administration solely during the first month of abemaciclib therapy in the prospective population, guided by literature data indicating a higher incidence and severity of diarrhea at abemaciclib initiation. However, it is essential to recognize that chronic toxicities, even at G1/2, can have significant implications if sustained over a prolonged period. While our study focused on short-term outcomes, the potential impact of chronic toxicities warrants consideration in future investigations with longer follow-up periods and/or longer postbiotic administration to assess the durability of treatment effects and mitigate potential long-term consequences. It is also noteworthy that the postbiotic was administered alongside standard supportive therapy with loperamide, which could potentially introduce a confounding effect but it was necessary according to good clinical practice. When evaluating loperamide use, we found that fewer Postbio patients required it. Furthermore, despite guideline recommendations, loperamide was associated with other AEs, including moderate/severe constipation (as known by the neoMONARCH study).

General

Allergic Reactions

Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported.

Hepatic Impairment

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied. Use loperamide hydrochloride with caution in such patients because the systematic exposure to loperamide may be increased due to reduced metabolism. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment closely for signs of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since it has been reported that the majority of the drug is metabolized and metabolites or the unchanged drug is excreted mainly in the feces, dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not required.

Geriatric Use

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of loperamide in elderly subjects. However, in two studies that enrolled elderly patients, there were no major differences in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients.

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see WARNINGS).

Information for Patients

Advise patients:

to take loperamide hydrochloride at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage is not recommended (see WARNINGS). Report to a healthcare facility if you or someone you are caring for taking loperamide hydrochloride experiences fainting episode, a rapid or irregular heartbeat or become unresponsive.
with acute diarrhea, that if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, discontinue loperamide hydrochloride and contact their healthcare provider.
to contact their healthcare provider if they see blood in their stools, or if they develop a fever or abdominal distention.
to use caution when driving a car or operating machinery, as tiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with loperamide hydrochloride (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Irinotecan hydrochloride (Camptosar) [^a6dd6d0f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions

Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of CAMPTOSAR) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses.

Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3–4 late diarrhea occurred in 23–31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3-week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with CAMPTOSAR until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of CAMPTOSAR should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea.

### A case report of torsade de pointes and Brugada pattern associated with loperamide misuse and supratherapeutic loperamide concentrations [^a3a5fe45]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Loperamide, commonly sold under the brand name Imodium® (Johnson & Johnson, Fort Washington, PA), is a widely available, over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication that possesses µ-opioid agonist properties and can have catastrophic cardiac events when misused or abused. Since the start of the opioid epidemic in the United States, there has been an increasing number of case reports and deaths linking loperamide abuse with cardiac events such as torsades de pointes (TdP) and Brugada syndrome.

Case Report

This case report presents a 22-year-old man who presented in cardiac arrest from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia consistent with TdP and a Type 1 Brugada pattern after intentional loperamide abuse. We discuss this patient's management and the proposed pathophysiology of these two cardiotoxicities, of which, to our knowledge, no previously published case report has displayed both in the same patient after a supratherapeutic loperamide ingestion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As the prevalence of opioid dependency and misuse has increased, so, too, has the misuse of un-scheduled medications such as loperamide to achieve central nervous system opioid effects. It is important for the emergency physician to know about and understand loperamide-associated cardiotoxicities such as prolongation of the QRS, unmasking of Brugada patterns, QT prolongation, or ventricular dysrhythmias such as TdP to be able to recognize and treat it.

### Long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder: a case series [^2b3cbcf5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Current data suggest that the opioid epidemic represents a worsening problem in the United States. However, prescribing rates of opioids have been steadily declining, suggesting that alternative opioids are becoming a major contributor to this crisis. One medication that has shown an increase in nonmedical use is loperamide. Loperamide is a peripheral mu-opioid agonist that is intended to be used for diarrhea. However, when taken at high doses and/or in combination with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, it acts centrally by penetrating the blood-brain-barrier. Loperamide crossing the blood-brain-barrier results in similar central nervous system depression as other opioids. Loperamide's over-the-counter availability and growing media presence has resulted in more cases of loperamide substance use disorder, predominantly to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms and to produce a euphoric state. This case series presents 3 patients with loperamide-associated opioid use disorder who have been successfully treated with on-going buprenorphine treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case-series to explore long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder. Our findings suggest that buprenorphine can be used for loperamide use disorder, most effectively when patients are in mild to moderate withdrawal. These cases also demonstrate how different waiting times were necessary before starting buprenorphine treatment in order to avoid precipitated withdrawal.

GI Toxicity: Diarrhea

Management strategies to minimize diarrhea include dietary modifications such as eating small meals and avoiding greasy or spicy food, milk, caffeine, and alcohol. If diarrhea develops, patients may benefit from the B-R-A-T diet (bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast/decaffeinated tea) and maintaining fluids (6–8 large glasses of water, clear liquids, or soup per day). Medications such as diphenoxylate-atropine may be used to treat diarrhea. Oral administration of loperamide at low doses can be used; however, loperamide should be used with caution in certain patients, including those with underlying bradycardia, congestive heart failure (CHF), or prolonged QTc due to the risk of Torsades de Pointes (Table 3). Potassium and magnesium levels should be evaluated in patients with diarrhea to ensure they are maintained in appropriate range (Table 4).

### Antidiarrheal medicine loperamide (imodium) [^f83095a4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Welcome to FDA Drug Safety Podcasts for health care professionals. This is Lesley Navin Advanced Practice Nurse from the Division of Drug Information. On June 7, 2016, FDA is warning that taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter and prescription diarrhea medicine loperamide, including through abuse or misuse of the product, can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death. The risk of these serious heart problems, including abnormal heart rhythms, may also be increased when high doses of loperamide are taken with several kinds of medicines that interact with loperamide. The majority of reported serious heart problems occurred in individuals who were intentionally misusing and abusing high doses of loperamide in attempts to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve a feeling of euphoria. We will continue to evaluate and determine if additional FDA actions are needed.

Health care professionals should be aware that higher than recommended loperamide doses can result in serious cardiac adverse events including QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest. In cases of abuse, individuals often use other drugs with loperamide. If loperamide toxicity is suspected, discontinue loperamide and start necessary therapy. If loperamide ingestion is suspected, measure blood levels, which may require specific testing. For some Torsades de Pointes cases in which drug treatment is ineffective, electrical pacing or cardioversion may be required. From 1976 through 2015, FDA received reports of 48 cases of serious heart problems associated with loperamide use. Thirty-one cases resulted in hospitalizations and 10 patients died. Serious heart problems occurred mostly in patients taking higher than recommended doses.

Other patients took the recommended dose along with interacting medicines causing an increase in loperamide levels.

### Loperamide-induced hypopituitarism [^670cb645]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well recognised that potent opioids, used either as analgesic medications or for illicit recreation, may produce dose-related hypopituitarism, including clinically significant hypoadrenalism and male hypogonadism. For illustration, 74% of community dwelling men taking strong opioids (≥ 20 mg morphine daily or equivalent) had a total serum testosterone concentration below the reference range in a previous study. Similarly, secondary adrenal failure has been frequently reported during both short-term and chronic opioid administration. Opioids act centrally to suppress the hypothalamic release of the hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, leading to the downstream effects of hypoadrenalism and hypogonadism.

Although clinically manifest hypopituitarism in the setting of loperamide use has not been previously described, the effects of this drug on human HPA physiology were first reported in 1986 when it was found to inhibit plasma ACTH levels in a small number of patients with Addison's disease. 16 mg of oral loperamide induced a marked fall in ACTH levels that was detectable 1-hour postdose and persisted for several hours after administration, with a nadir at 300 min. Similar reductions in basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH have also been demonstrated in normal persons. Plasma levels of ACTH were markedly suppressed 3 hours after oral ingestion of 16 mg of loperamide, with both studies supporting a hypothalamic–pituitary mechanism for the effects observed in our patient.

While adrenal failure in the context of loperamide has not previously been reported, the overlapping chemical structure of this drug with opioids supports the mechanism of secondary adrenal failure seen here with high-dose loperamide.

Learning points

Adrenal failure secondary to hypopituitarism is a serious and hitherto unrecognised side effect of this very commonly used medication.
Critically, it was demonstrable in this patient while taking a quantity of loperamide just marginally higher than the maximum recommended dose.
Failure to recognise adrenal failure in this setting, where warning symptoms and signs (eg, hyponatraemia, hypotension) may overlap with either acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease, could have a disastrous impact.
Opioids, used more commonly at higher doses with significant systemic absorption than loperamide, can cause dose-related hypopituitarism and clinically significant adrenal failure.
It is imperative that clinicians exercise caution when relying on loperamide to manage their patients' chronic diarrhoea; we should be mindful of the possibility of drug-induced life-threatening adrenal insufficiency.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^3b453440]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) — loperamide recommendation and evidence: The AGA suggests using loperamide in patients IBS-D-. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty). No new studies have evaluated the efficacy of loperamide in the management of patients with IBS, and evidence comes from two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; there was a lack of beneficial effect on global improvement of symptoms of IBS and urgency, with no improvement in urgency and no data on IBS-QOL or adverse events. Loperamide is FDA-approved for the treatment of diarrhea, and the optimal dose and method of using loperamide is not known and can vary between patients based on symptom patterns.

### Brugada-type pattern on electrocardiogram associated with high-dose loperamide abuse [^05a2c872]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Loperamide has been increasing in popularity recently for its effects separate from treatment of diarrhea. In large doses or in combination with other agents, it can lead to desirable effects in the central nervous system. However, cardiotoxicity has been reported with its abuse.

Case Report

A 49-year-old male who had been chronically abusing loperamide was found to have Brugada-like changes on his electrocardiogram (ECG). He had no other clinical symptoms associated with Brugada syndrome and did not have similar findings on previous ECGs. After abstaining from further loperamide use during hospitalization, this pattern slowly resolved without clinically significant dysrthymias. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? A patient with a history of loperamide abuse is at risk for cardiotoxicity. While other dysrhythmias are reported more commonly with loperamide abuse, Brugada-like ECG changes can occur and warrant appropriate consultation and prompt follow-up.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^709871e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dehydration

Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of loperamide hydrochloride does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.

Gastrointestinal Disorders

In general, loperamide hydrochloride should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. Loperamide hydrochloride must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop.

Treatment of diarrhea with loperamide hydrochloride is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated).

Patients with AIDS treated with loperamide hydrochloride for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride.

Variability in Pediatric Response

Loperamide hydrochloride should be used with special caution in pediatric patients because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, may further influence the variability of response to loperamide hydrochloride. Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions.

A number of the adverse events reported during the clinical investigations and postmarketing experience with loperamide are frequent symptoms of the underlying diarrheal syndrome (abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and flatulence). These symptoms are often difficult to distinguish from undesirable drug effects.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase II study of AGI004 for control of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea [^39c97c0c]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea (CID) is a common complication of cancer treatment causing effects ranging from troublesome to life threatening. The incidence of CID is variable, occurring at any severity in 40–80% of patients receiving irinotecan, fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin alone or in combination. Severe diarrhoea (NCI CTC v3.0 grade 3 or 4) occurs less frequently but has been reported at rates of up to 31% in patients receiving irinotecan with consequent dose reduction or delay or, more worryingly, resulting in cessation of treatment or patient mortality. Attempts to identify biomarkers predictive of gastrointestinal toxicity following treatment with these agents have not yielded consistent results; hence, patients receiving these agents do not routinely undergo pharmacogenetic testing currently but are counselled about the risk of CID and the need for prompt treatment in the event of this occurring.

The mechanism of CID is not completely understood but is thought to be a multifactorial process. Chemotherapy causes direct toxic effects on proliferating epithelial crypt cells resulting in disruption of the mucosal barrier and impaired absorption of electrolytes and water from the gut lumen resulting in diarrhoea. There is also altered enzyme secretion and changes in gut motility causing a reduction in transit time. Management of CID generally involves use of anti-diarrhoeal rescue medication, with use of opioids such as loperamide considered standard first-line treatment agents alongside supportive measures such as hydration. Loperamide acts as a μ -opioid receptor agonist in the intestine, but not centrally, reducing gastrointestinal motility and increasing water reabsorption and has been shown to be an effective treatment in the initial management of CID, but less effective in controlling severe diarrhoea. In this setting the somatostatin analogue octreotide, which exerts its anti-diarrhoeal effects by decreasing gastrointestinal hormone secretion, reducing intestinal mobility and increasing water reabsorption, has demonstrated efficacy in controlling even severe or persistent CID. This is clearly an effective agent for treatment of CID; however, it requires repeated parenteral administration in view of its short half life and is relatively expensive.

Loperamide for functional gastrointestinal disease in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — loperamide is reported efficacious for diarrhea in IBS, decreasing stool frequency, increasing water and ion absorption, improving stool consistency and urgency, and may improve anal sphincter tone, but generally does not significantly affect pain; typical dosing is 2 mg after each loose bowel movement (usually < 8 mg per day) or preprandial 2–4 mg in IBS patients with prominent diarrhea after feeding.

### Loperamide-induced severe cardiotoxicity: a toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic analysis derived from a case series and the published literature [^143d5d5f]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic loperamide overdose is associated with cardiotoxicity. We describe the toxicokinetics of loperamide and N-desmethyl loperamide, and their concentration-response relationship on cardiotoxicity in newly described and published cases.

Materials and Methods

We obtained serial loperamide and N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations, and corresponding electrocardiographic intervals in three episodes (two patients) of loperamide-related cardiotoxicity. A toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic analysis was undertaken that included data from previous publications to explore the relationship between these variables.

Results

Patients presented with dizziness, bradycardia, loss of consciousness, and jerking or ventricular tachycardia after taking loperamide 320-400mg/day for weeks or years. In one patient, ventricular tachycardia occurred on days two and three post-admission. Prolonged electrocardiographic intervals resolved after approximately five days. Admission loperamide concentrations were 5.37–288μg/L and the terminal elimination half-lives were 21.3–38.7h. Admission N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations were 87.67–256.34μg/L and the terminal elimination half-life was 31.9–88.9h. Overall, there were 42 loperamide and 35 N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations with paired electrocardiographic data, and the concentration-response relationship was derived using a maximum effect (Emax) model. Lower loperamide concentrations were associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities, compared to N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations. The total relative loperamide concentration, which combines both concentrations into a single value using in vitro inhibitory potencies at cardiac ion channels, out-performed either parent or metabolite concentrations alone for predicting cardiotoxicity on receiver operating characteristic curves.

Discussion

Loperamide and N-desmethyl loperamide have long elimination half-lives causing prolonged cardiotoxicity. Higher loperamide and N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations are associated with prolonged electrocardiographic intervals.

Conclusions

Patients with chronic loperamide overdose are at risk of cardiotoxicity that persists for days due to persistent loperamide and N-desmethyl loperamide concentrations. We believe patients with loperamide overdose need an admission electrocardiograph and continuous monitoring until electrocardiographic changes resolve.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^c3c80314]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 6: Pharmacologic therapy — Antimotility and antisecretory agents are frequently necessary to control stool losses in SBS. Massive enterectomy–related gastric hypersecretion and hypergastrinemia may last 6–12 months postoperatively, and antisecretory medications (proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists) are beneficial; some specialists have suggested that acid-suppressing agents should be used sparingly beyond 12 months unless there is clear evidence of persistent benefit. Octreotide may reduce secretions and slow transit but has not been shown to improve absorption or reduce the need for PN, may worsen malabsorption, should generally be reserved for large stool losses with problematic fluid and electrolyte management, and should be avoided during the period of intestinal adaptation. Antidiarrheals reduce motility; commonly used agents include loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, codeine, and tincture of opium, with loperamide preferred because it is not addictive or sedative; use should be guided by objective measurements of stool output, and loperamide and codeine may have a synergistic effect. In SBS without an ileum, high loperamide doses are frequently needed (ie, up to 16 tablets [32 mg]/d), and these agents seem to be most effective when administered about 30 minutes before meals.

### Arrhythmogenesis and prolonged repolarization from synthetic opioids: finally sorted? [^70a6633c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Putting all of this together, there are several unresolved issues with Klein et al.'s work. Currently lacking are (1) a mechanism(s) of arrhythmogenesis and (2) triggered activity that would reach threshold for a subsequent AP. Their supplemental data show higher concentrations of methadone associate with small membrane oscillations between slow pacing events (0.3 Hz), which may be technically DADs; however, none trigger a subsequent AP nor sustained firing. DADs require SR Ca 2+ loading to initiateand show typical frequency dependencesuch that the experimental conditions here are unlikely to produce DADs of sufficient amplitude to initiation arrhythmia. Given the scope of what has already been characterized with loss of I Kr and I K1, one would have expected an investigation for the conditions for EAD induction, both phase 2 and phase 3. Further characterization of the AP, with different pacing frequencies and changing [K+] in external solutions would better elucidate the full effects of methadone and recapitulate conditions associated with its clinical features of arrhythmogenicity. The reasons for the AP shortening also need some flushing out, particularly because the loss of dV/dT may be related to progressive block of I K1, resting membrane potential depolarization and unavailability of sodium channels, as we and others have shown in human ventricular myocytes. Such findings could explain the conduction defects in addition to prolonged QT interval noted in loperamide overdoses.

Regardless of the missing pieces, this article highlights the need to look beyond HERG when considering the cardiac safety of new drugs. It long been the purview that HERG inhibition is the barrier to drug safety and, although demonstrating normal HERG current and trafficking is essential, other ionic currents should be considered. Human induced pluripotent stem cells represent a model to resolve this issue, but particular attention needs to be focused on induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes with normal I K1 density.

The story with methadone and cardiac toxicity reaches a new (if unresolved) chapter with this insightful work. As the vulnerabilities of loss of I K1 are better understood, mitigation measures for methadone and other arrhythmogenic drugs influence may be finally clarified.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^a54957ef]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety

Based on this evidence, we can state that racecadotril has a very good safety and tolerability profile, is not different from placebo, and clearly better than loperamide. Post-marketing data cumulate knowledge from about 71 million adults and 65 million infants and children. Overall, there were only 530 (0.00075%) and 265 (0.00041%) individual case safety reports, respectively.

The most common side effect of racecadotril is headache (2/96 patients in the clinical trial by Baumer et al.). Furthermore, cutaneous/subcutaneous (including erythema, edema, urticaria, and itching have been described) and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms have been reported. It is not futile to repeat that generally in all studies both in adults and in children adverse events incidence is not significantly different from placebo. Nevertheless, racecadotril is not indicated in antibiotic-induced diarrhea and chronic diarrhea due to a lack of clinical studies in these indications. Moreover, there are little data available on patients with severe renal or hepatic insufficiency and the drug must be administered according to the indications of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). In patients with prolonged vomiting, bioavailability may be reduced. Patients with hereditary metabolic deficiencies, like galactose intolerance, Lapp-lactase deficit, or glucose-galactose malabsorption, must avoid racecadotril.

The risk of drug interaction (DDI) is very low even if it has been reported an increased risk of angioedema in patients using ACE inhibitors. The mechanism beside this side effect is the increase of bradykinin the degradation of which is mediated by both ACE and a neutral endopeptidase inhibited by racecadotril. Therefore, patients taking ACE inhibitors should be warned in advance that in case of diarrhea, the concomitant use of racecadotril could increase the risk of developing angioedema. Despite this interaction risk being reported in racecadotril's SmPC, its evidence is limited to case reports.

### European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management and avoidance of adverse events of treatment in chronic myeloid leukaemia [^290d25b1]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

The prevention of AEs of TKI treatment of CML has been addressed only marginally in randomized trials. Two reasons account for this: first, because it is not the objective of these kind of trials, and second, because in pivotal randomized trials, the spectrum of AEs is still being discovered and with longer follow-up, unforeseen late AEs are revealed. Also, this topic cannot be properly addressed in retrospective studies. The information on the kinetics of appearance of AEs is scarce. Development of AEs can be determined by type of TKI, dosage, schedule, disease phase, concomitant medications and body size.

Our present recommendations comprise three types of information. First, the kinetics of appearance of AEs, in order to inform the reader when to be more cautious. Second, the conditions before or concurrent with TKI treatment that predispose to TKI toxicity. Here it is important to note that, while it is sensible to treat comorbidities optimally (for example, the control of hyperlipidemia) or to change food or lifestyle, there are only very scarce data on whether this mitigates the incidence or severity of AEs. Third, the hypotheses on pathogenesis that the authors have offered in their studies. In the absence of evidence for prevention of AEs, our recommendations are based on the application of ars medica, reflecting the opinion given by the authors of system-specific sections and the opinion of the panel reviewers and members.

General approach to the management of AEs

Early and prompt recognition is crucial for optimal management, without unduly compromising treatment continuity. First of all, patient education on potential AEs and their time course is vital, together with pre-emptive treatment to reduce AE risk (for example, loperamide to pre-empt bosutinib-associated diarrhoea). Most of the study protocols have used the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC) for classifying the severity of AEs, and there are similarities in management strategies across different studies. It is worth noting that the NCI-CTC criteria are not always precise enough to quantitate the severity of AEs.

However, the success of these strategies has not been studied in depth. Aspects such as reversibility, frequency of relapses and severity are known only for a limited number of AEs. Our general approach for managing AEs is summarised as follows, depending on the grade of severity:

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^48fb3865]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

For SG-related any-grade diarrhea, we recommend initiating treatment with 4 mg of oral loperamide, followed by 2 mg thereafter with each episode, to a maximum dose of 16 mg/day until resolved. If diarrhea is not resolved after 24 hours or the patient is experiencing 3–4 stools per day when at a near maximum loperamide dose, oral 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine sulfate should be considered 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 20 mg diphenoxylate-0.2 mg atropine sulfate per day until control is achieved. Discontinue diphenoxylate-atropine use if clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days of administering the maximum dose. Because the severity of diarrhea associated with SG can vary widely by case, some patients may benefit from alternating loperamide with diphenoxylate-atropine administration. We have used loperamide prophylactically (not routine) and administered loperamide alternating with diphenoxylate-atropine. The PRIMED study included an investigation of the use of prophylactic loperamide with SG therapy, with loperamide given for 3 consecutive days after SG administration (ie, Days 2, 3, and 4 and Days 9, 10, and 11) for the first 2 cycles (with the option to extend to the next cycle based on the physician's discretion). Rates of diarrhea (34%)were lower compared with those reported in the ASCENT (65%)and TROPiCS-02 (62%)studies (Table 1). Constipation was observed in 46% of patients in PRIMED; whereas rates of 37% and 19% were observed in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02, respectively. Octreotide (100–150 μg, may increase to 500–2000 μg intravenous [IV] or SQ 3 times daily; discontinue within 24 hours of resolution to reduce risk of ileus) can also be effective with unusual cases of persisting diarrhea. However, the octreotide injection is painful, and ice on the injection site may be helpful. Additionally, patients should hydrate with oral or IV fluids as needed.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^75d29bb0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Small amounts of loperamide may appear in human breast milk. Therefore, loperamide hydrochloride is not recommended during breast-feeding.

Pediatric Use

Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age (see WARNINGS). Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, such as altered mental status, somnolence, and respiratory depression, than adults. There have been rare reports of paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with pediatric patients less than two years of age.

Loperamide hydrochloride should be used with special caution in pediatric patients because of their greater variability of response (see WARNINGS). Dehydration, particularly in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, may further influence the variability of response to loperamide hydrochloride.

The safety and effectiveness of loperamide hydrochloride in pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea have not been established. Although loperamide hydrochloride has been studied in a limited number of pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established.

In case of accidental overdosage of loperamide hydrochloride by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for suggested treatment.

### Electrocardiographic abnormalities, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy associated with loperamide abuse [^0e8aca59]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old man presented with recurrent syncope and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). His evaluation revealed a prolonged QT interval > 600 milliseconds, witnessed torsades de pointes (TdP), and dilated cardiomyopathy. At his initial admission, an ICD was implanted and atrial pacing at 80 beats per minute suppressed ventricular arrhythmias. The patient was readmitted with device infection and recurrent TdP leading to intubation. This led to the discovery of a hitherto unrevealed loperamide abuse and his cardiac arrhythmias and LV dysfunction were determined to be related to large doses of loperamide. Following abstinence, his ejection fraction and ECG returned to normal.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal with opioid-receptor agonist properties. Recommended over-the-counter doses (range = 2–8 mg daily) do not produce opioid effects in the central nervous system because of poor oral bioavailability and P-glycoprotein efflux* of the medication (1); recent reports suggest that large doses (50–300 mg) of loperamide produce euphoria, central nervous system depression, and cardiotoxicity (2–4). Abuse of loperamide for its euphoric effect or for self-treatment of opioid withdrawal is increasing (5). Cases of loperamide abuse reported to the Upstate New York Poison Center and New York City Poison Control Center were analyzed for demographic, exposure, clinical, and laboratory characteristics. Cases of intentional loperamide abuse reported to the National Poison Database System (NPDS) also were analyzed for demographic, dose, formulation, and outcome information.

### Prevention and management of adverse events related to regorafenib [^3eba1194]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is common among patients receiving regorafenib. Five grades of diarrhea are described in the CTCAE version 4.03 (Table 1). Although grade 1 diarrhea (an increase of < 4 stools per day over baseline) may not present a significant problem for patients, grade 2 diarrhea (increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline) can have a moderate effect on quality of life, limiting the patient's ability to leave the house, and grade 3 diarrhea (increase of ≥ 7 stools per day over baseline and incontinence) severely affects self-care activities of daily living (ADL). That said, in our experience, the prolonged occurrence of grade 2 diarrhea may negatively affect a patient's quality of life and ADL more than a short-lasting grade 3 event, and so it is important that patients are educated about the need to report and manage any occurrence of diarrhea.

Dietary advice that may minimize the likelihood of diarrhea (e.g. ensuring a low intake of fiber) should be given to patients on initiation of treatment. In order to effectively manage diarrhea and prevent symptoms from increasing in severity, patients should be advised to contact their healthcare team if they have an increase of more than three stools per day. Patients should also be educated about the variation in stool form and advised that changes to stool number or consistency do not always indicate diarrhea that requires treatment. The Bristol stool chart is a useful tool to help explain the variation to patients — stools are classified into seven types, with types 5–7 tending towards diarrhea.

We recommend that patients experiencing diarrhea of grades 1 and 2 should be advised to take loperamide (two 2-mg tablets) after the first stool and one additional tablet every 2 h, until 12 h after the last watery stool, for a maximum of 48 h. It is important to confirm that the patient is experiencing diarrhea, as the use of loperamide could otherwise cause constipation. In addition, the risk of developing constipation is increased in a patient already taking opioids for cancer-related pain. If loperamide does not control the diarrhea, for example when diarrhea remains grade 3 or higher after the 48-h loperamide period, the patient is likely to become dehydrated — the patient should be encouraged to increase fluid intake and hospital admission should be considered.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^3a86ac04]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, this guideline suggests against the use of antispasmodic medications like drotaverine and mebeverine for the treatment of IBS or FAP. Drotaverine is a phosphodiesterase‐4 inhibitor that promotes muscle relaxation by reducing muscle cell phosphorylation. Mebeverine, on the other hand, acts as a direct musculotropic spasmolytic, inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular calcium and stabilizing muscle cell membranes. The efficacy of drotaverine and mebeverine is not supported by evidence, possibly due to their distinct mechanisms of action.

Rationale: Despite a lack of any evidence of the efficacy of loperamide in children, the GDG is in consensus that they frequently use it for patients with IBS‐D specifically and have good experience with its effect on improving stool consistency. It acts as an opioid receptor agonist and impedes colonic transit time through a direct effect on intestinal muscles, and it also inhibits luminal electrolyte loss, causing hardening of stools. Availability, ease of use, and low cost support its use for symptom control. Limited evidence of very low certainty exists for efficacy on stool consistency in adults. Caution should be exercised beyond dosing for infrequent symptom control, as loperamide may induce QTc prolongation, as well as cause central side effects due to crossing of the blood–brain barrier at higher dosages. It is also contraindicated in specific clinical situations, including bacterial enterocolitis due to the risk of toxic megacolon.

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^6305e1c2]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical Trial Data

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with IMODIUM® were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.

The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators.

1) Adverse events from 4 placebo-controlled studies in patients with acute diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride, were: dry mouth, flatulence, abdominal cramp and colic.

2) Adverse events from 20 placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented below in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: nausea, vomiting, headache, meteorism, abdominal pain, abdominal cramp and colic.

3) Adverse events from seventy-six controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients with acute or chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater in patients from all studies are given in the table below.

### Peripherally restricted transthyretin-based delivery system for probes and therapeutics avoiding opioid-related side effects [^ba6806aa]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We also evaluated the efficacy of the long-acting antidiarrheal agent loperamide in inducing constipation in our OIC rat model. Loperamide enters the brain readily but due to efflux by P-glycoprotein its CNS concentration is minimal. At therapeutic doses, the action of loperamide is peripherally restricted to the mu-opioid receptors in the gut. However, at higher doses loperamide can overwhelm the efflux transporter, accumulate in the brain, and lead to opioid-related CNS adverse effects including overdose and death. In contrast, fentanyl (a lipophilic drug with high CNS penetration) has a 2-fold preference for the brain over plasma. Similar to fentanyl, loperamide has high potent agonist activity on the mu-opioid receptors (K i = 0.53 nM vs. K i = 0.39 nM for fentanyl). The reported ED 50 of subcutaneous loperamide for inducing constipation is 1 mg/kg (GI transit = 50%). Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of loperamide vs. fentanyl in inducing OIC at a dose of 1 mg/kg. In our study, the inhibition of GI transit by loperamide (GI transit = 54.5 ± 4.9%, which is consistent with literature) was 25-fold lower than that of fentanyl (GI transit = 2.3 ± 1.8%) (Supplementary Fig. 12). Increasing the dose of loperamide by 30-fold (30 mg/kg) has been reported to result in less than 2-fold decrease in GI transit (GI transit = 30%). It is important to note that the anticholinergic action of loperamide (through a nonopioid mediated process)may also contribute to the inhibition of the GI transit observed in our studies.

Collectively, these data (Figs. 6–8) provide insights that highlight the critical role of mu-opioid receptors, in both CNS and peripheral nervous system, in causing OIC. Importantly, our findings on the critical role of the mu-opioid receptors in the CNS for causing OIC challenge the theory that morphine and other opioid agonists reduce GI motility through a mechanism involving predominantly the mu-opioid receptors in the GI tract and that the CNS contribution to constipation is minor –. This information provides clues that explain deficiencies associated with current PAMORAs.

### Intentional misuse and abuse of loperamide: a new look at a drug with "Low abuse potential" [^ad5ccec8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its opioid properties, loperamide has long been thought to have low abuse potential due to its poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and limited potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. A recent patient reportedly taking loperamide to avoid heroin withdrawal symptoms, at doses approximately 100 times those recommended, directed our attention to this issue.

Objectives

1) Investigate number of cases of intentional loperamide abuse and misuse reported to poison centers between 2009 and 2015; 2) Compile reports of clinical effects of loperamide abuse; and 3) Search for evidence of increasing Internet interest in the central opioid effects of loperamide.

Methods

For the years 2009 thru 2015, we reviewed exposure calls related to misuse/abuse of loperamide in the Texas Poison Center Network's database and the National Poison Data System. We used Google trend analysis to detect evidence of increased Internet interest in the illicit use of loperamide.

Results

Between 2009 and 2015, the number of misuse/abuse calls related to loperamide alone nearly doubled, with about one-third of cases occurring in teens and young adults in their 20s. Of particular concern are reports of significant cardiotoxic effects (∼18% of cases), including conduction defects and various dysrhythmias, sometimes leading to death. Google Trends analysis demonstrates an increasing number of searches for "loperamide high" and "loperamide withdrawal" beginning in 2011.

Conclusions

Loperamide misuse/abuse seems to be on the rise. Given its propensity to induce conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias at very high doses, emergency physicians should be vigilant for this form of drug abuse.

### Potent inhibition of hERG channels by the Over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent Loperamide [^68928a7f]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro electrophysiological properties of loperamide. The authors' hypothesis was that loperamide is a potent blocker of the current carried by the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel.

Background

Loperamide is a peripherally-acting μ-opioid agonist available worldwide as an over-the-counter treatment for diarrhea. Like most opioids, it is not currently known to be proarrhythmic. Recent cases of torsade de pointes in association with high-dose loperamide raise concern given its structural similarity to methadone, another synthetic opioid with an established arrhythmia risk.

Methods

Effects of loperamide on blockade of the hERG potassium channel ion current were assessed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing hERG to elucidate current amplitude and kinetics. The concentration required to produce 50% inhibition of hERG current was assessed from the amplitude of tail currents and the impact on action potential duration was assessed in isolated swine ventricular cardiomyocytes.

Results

The 50% inhibitory concentration for loperamide inhibition of hERG ionic tail currents was approximately 40 nmol/l. In current-voltage measurements, loperamide reduced steady and tail currents and shifted the current activation to more negative potentials. Loperamide (10 nmol/l) also increased the action potential duration, assessed at 90% of repolarization, in ventricular myocytes by 16.4 ± 1.7% (n = 6; p < 0.004). The maximum rate of rise of phase 0 of the action potential, however, was not significantly altered at any tested concentration of loperamide.

Conclusions

Loperamide is a potent hERG channel blocker. It significantly prolongs the action potential duration and suggests a causal association between loperamide and recent clinical cases of torsade de pointes.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^3dcbc54f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Ancillary management — antimotility, antinausea, and antiemetic agents: Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate); loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). An antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate). During acute gastroenteritis, more children receiving ondansetron, compared with placebo, had resolution of vomiting and ondansetron reduced the immediate need for hospitalization or intravenous rehydration; however, ondansetron did not decrease hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge and diarrhea was reported as a side effect. A recommendation cannot be made for the routine use of antiemetic agents for acute gastroenteritis in children < 4 years of age or in adults; bismuth subsalicylate is mildly effective, and racecadotril reduces stool volume but is not available in North America.

### Cardiac conduction disturbance after loperamide abuse [^ac3d7c58]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Prescription opioid abuse is a major public health concern and an ongoing epidemic in the United States. Loperamide is a widely available and inexpensive over-the-counter antidiarrheal with peripheral mu-opioid receptor activity. Online resources discuss the use of loperamide for the amelioration of withdrawal symptoms or recreational abuse. We describe the clinical course of 5 patients abusing loperamide, 3 of whom had life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Methods

In this observational case series, patients with cardiac arrhythmias or history of loperamide abuse with cardiac arrhythmias were identified; 5 patients were identified and 4 of the 5 patients were seen directly at the bedside. Clinical profile and outcome of patients is reported.

Results

We report 5 patients with history of loperamide abuse; 3 of the 5 patients had life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. One of the patients experienced a second life-threatening arrhythmia after he resumed loperamide abuse. Loperamide levels were obtained in 4 of the 5 patients and were at least one order of magnitude greater than therapeutic concentrations. Discontinuation of loperamide resulted in complete resolution of cardiac conduction disturbances.

Conclusion

This case series describes several patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias temporally related to loperamide abuse. With the recent efforts to restrict the diversion of prescription opioids, increasing abuse of loperamide as an opioid substitute may be seen. Toxicologists should be aware of these risks and we urge all clinicians to report such cases to FDA Medwatch(®).

### Epidemiology, management and outcome of ultrashort bowel syndrome in infancy [^07b5b14e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Intestinal continuity

The benefits of restoration of intestinal continuity by joining the small bowel remnant to the colon need to be considered. It provides a distinct advantage of increasing enteral tolerance by increasing the absorptive surface and prolonging transit time. It may also allow colonic adaptation to occur which will increase absorption of short-chain fatty acids which can potentially be an additional source of enteral calories. However, the disadvantage of continuity may be high stool output with watery diarrhoea which can be difficult to manage and cause perianal complications. Careful replacement of fluid and electrolytes is essential and some cases with high stool output (stoma output > 30 mL/kg, > 6 watery stools/day) may require antidiarrhoeal agents like loperamide or antisecretory agents, for example, proton pump inhibitors or clonidine. In children where the colon cannot be in continuity because of high output, the options are to keep the proximal small bowel loop drained with a nasojejunal tube until a definitive management plan has been formed, create a tube enterostomy or create a standard spouted stoma. A tube enterostomy is made by bringing the bowel to the surface of the abdominal wall and creating a small opening big enough to insert a tube the size of a Foley catheter. The advantage is that bowel length is not lost in creating a spout as in a traditional stoma, and in the event of reversal some length is preserved. With a tube enterostomy, it is also easier to control the output which is likely to be high and watery by spiggoting. This gives the option to 'expansion recycle' should lengthening be considered and also reduces loss of length in subsequent closure.

### Apraglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-2 analog, improves fluid absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome intestinal failure: findings from a placebo-controlled, randomized phase 2 trial [^0d4c4d1f]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients were required to record their 48‐h spontaneous dietary fluid intake for days 20–22 to investigate whether increases in intestinal absorption were associated with decreases in spontaneous dietary fluid intake. Because of the short treatment period of 4 weeks, PS volume reductions were allowed between days 4 and 24 if judged clinically necessary by the investigator because of clinical signs of fluid retention, such as edema, excessive unintended weight gain, and/or polyuria. Clinical signs could be observed by the investigator during trial visits or reported by the patient during telephone visits throughout the trial. PS volume reductions were assessed during days 20–22. Patients returned to their baseline PS volume and content during the end of the treatment urine collection (days 27–29). Concomitant medications, including proton‐pump inhibitors, loperamide, and opiates, were kept unchanged and stable throughout the trial. If necessary, adjustments could be made in the drinking menu and prescribed PS volume and content between treatment periods.

Body weight (determined using a leveled platform scale) and body composition (determined at the same time of day, relative to PS administration, by dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry [DXA; Norland XR‐36 DXA densitometer, Ford Atkinson, WI, US]) were measured at baseline and at the end of treatment. Blood samples for fasting plasma citrulline, a suggested marker of enterocyte mass, were collected at baseline; during the first, second, and final treatment visits; 4 days after the first treatment; and 4–6 weeks after the last treatment. Plasma citrulline levels were determined as described in the Supplementary Material.

Outcomes

The primary end point was safety. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or disease) not necessarily causally related to treatment. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as an AE that resulted in death, was life‐threatening, required hospitalization, prolonged exciting hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, caused a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or was a medically important event. Secondary objectives related to efficacy included changes from baseline to the end of treatment in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion; changes from baseline to near end of treatment in PS volume and spontaneous dietary fluid intake; and changes from baseline to the end of treatment in body weight, lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral content, and plasma citrulline.

### Irinotecan hydrochloide [^5207b3ef]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Once-Every-3-Week Dosage Schedule

Single Arm Study: Study 6

Data from an open-label, single-agent, single-arm, multicenter, clinical study involving a total of 132 patients support a once every-3-week dosage schedule of irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum that recurred or progressed following treatment with 5-FU. Patients received a starting dose of 350 mg/m2given by 30-minute intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. Among the 132 previously treated patients in this trial, the intent-to-treat response rate was 12.1% (95% CI, 7.0% to 18.1%).

Randomized Studies: Studies 7 and 8

Two multicenter, randomized, clinical studies further support the use of irinotecan given by the once-every-3-week dosage schedule in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed following prior 5-FU therapy. In Study 7, second-line irinotecan therapy plus best supportive care was compared with best supportive care alone. In Study 8, second-line irinotecan therapy was compared with infusional 5-FU-based therapy. In both studies, irinotecan was administered intravenously at a starting dose of 350 mg/m2over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks. The starting dose was 300 mg/m2for patients who were 70 years and older or who had a performance status of 2. The highest total dose permitted was 700 mg. Dose reductions and/or administration delays were permitted in the event of severe hematologic and/or nonhematologic toxicities while on treatment. Best supportive care was provided to patients in both arms of Study 7 and included antibiotics, analgesics, corticosteroids, transfusions, psychotherapy, or any other symptomatic therapy as clinically indicated. In both studies, concomitant medications such as antiemetics, atropine, and loperamide were given to patients for prophylaxis and/or management of symptoms from treatment. If late diarrhea persisted for greater than 24 hours despite loperamide, a 7-day course of fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Patients in the control arm of the Study 8 received one of the following 5-FU regimens: (1) LV, 200 mg/m2IV over 2 hours; followed by 5-FU, 400 mg/m2IV bolus; followed by 5-FU, 600 mg/m2continuous IV infusion over 22 hours on days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks; (2) 5-FU, 250 to 300 mg/m2/day protracted continuous IV infusion until toxicity; (3) 5-FU, 2.6 to 3 g/m2IV over 24 hours every week for 6 weeks with or without LV, 20 to 500 mg/m2/day every week IV for 6 weeks with 2-week rest between cycles. Patients were to be followed every 3 to 6 weeks for 1 year.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^a76e3c9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Controlled Substance

Loperamide is not a controlled substance.

Abuse

Loperamide is a mu-opioid agonist. A human abuse potential study of loperamide hydrochloride at single doses up to 60 mg (3.75 times the recommended maximum adult dosage of 16 mg per day) was compared, in a double-blind cross-over design using nine subjects who had been active opiate users, to a threshold dose of codeine sulfate at 120 mg (96 mg base) or placebo. This resulted in one subject (11%) feeling a drug on placebo and identifying it as "dope" (heroin) and liking it slightly. Codeine was felt by 56% of subjects and identified as "dope" by 44%. Loperamide was felt by 44% of subjects and identified as "dope" by 11% and possibly dope mixed with some other kind of drug by another 22%. Loperamide abuse and misuse have been reported, especially at doses of 60 mg or greater. Loperamide can have greater CNS opioid effects at higher doses or with coadministration of drugs that increase systemic exposure and/or increase CNS penetration of loperamide (through inhibition of the CYP450 enzyme system or inhibition of P-glycoprotein). Loperamide is primarily being misused for relief from opioid withdrawal, and abused by a few users who obtain some (reportedly mild-moderate) level of euphoria\.

Dependence

In animals, parenteral administration of loperamide hydrochloride can cause physical dependence, cross-tolerance to opioids, and all the other pharmacologic effects typical of mu-opioid agonists. Studies in morphine-dependent monkeys demonstrated that loperamide hydrochloride at doses above those recommended for humans prevented signs of morphine withdrawal.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^136f0554]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Assessments

Patients were asked during the screening phase of both phase 3 studies whether they had used loperamide for their IBS-D over the past year (yes/no). Patients indicating prior loperamide use were asked whether loperamide was used acutely (defined as use for short-term relief, typically not exceeding 6 days of consecutive daily use), or chronically (defined as continuous use for maintenance therapy, typically exceeding ≥ 2 weeks of consecutive daily use), and whether loperamide had provided adequate control of their IBS symptoms (yes/no).

Use of over-the-counter loperamide rescue medication, purchased by the patient and reimbursed by the sponsor, was permitted during the treatment period for the acute treatment of uncontrolled diarrhea. A dose of 2 mg of loperamide was permitted once every 6 h, with the following guidelines: no more than 4 unit doses over a continuous 24 h time period (8 mg/day), no more than 7 unit doses over a continuous 48 h time period (14 mg over 2 days), and no more than 11 unit doses over a continuous 7-day time period (22 mg over 7 days). Patients were asked to record their use of loperamide rescue in electronic diaries for 26 weeks (IBS-3001) or 30 weeks (IBS-3002). Use of above the permitted amount of loperamide initiated an automatic alert to the investigator. In the event of excessive loperamide rescue use, the status of the patient was to be evaluated by the investigator as soon as possible. Treatment discontinuation in the event of excessive loperamide rescue use was at the discretion of the investigator.

Safety assessments

Safety and tolerability of eluxadoline were monitored throughout the studies through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examinations.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^c216d0d9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety findings with eluxadoline in patients who reported inadequate symptom control with loperamide were consistent with the findings from the overall phase 3 patient population and the known safety profile of eluxadoline (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data); over half of patients with inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide experienced AEs with eluxadoline, of which GI AEs (nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation) were the most frequent, although overall incidences were low. Of the patients who used rescue loperamide during the studies and reported GI AEs, over half reported ≥ 1 GI AE with an onset date after loperamide use. However, there was no clear temporal relationship between loperamide use and the occurrence of GI AEs. Constipation was more frequently reported in patients treated with eluxadoline compared with placebo, though the incidence was low and consistent with that from the overall phase 3 patient population (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data).

The primary end point of these two large, prospective trials focused on efficacy and safety. Although data collection for the trials was prospective, the present study represents a subgroup of the initial study, with the inherent limitations of such an analysis. That said, the large sample size and the prospective nature of the analyses minimizes these limitations. Furthermore, although many of the study patients had used loperamide during the year before study initiation, over half of the patients had not, and past use of loperamide relied upon patient recollection that may be unreliable and cannot be confirmed. Indeed, the exact dose of loperamide used by patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide remains unknown; therefore, a comparison of patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide at one dose compared with another dose is not possible.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^2402f71e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety

Overall, among patients with prior loperamide use with inadequate prior symptom control, over half in each treatment group experienced ≥ 1 AE (placebo: 50.6% eluxadoline 75 mg: 59.3% eluxadoline 100 mg: 61.0% Table 3). The most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in any treatment group) were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and headache. GI AEs tended to be more common in eluxadoline-treated patients, although the incidence was generally low (< 11% Table 3).

GI AEs were reported in approximately one-third of patients who used rescue loperamide during the studies, across the treatment groups (placebo: 24.7% eluxadoline 75 mg: 34.2% eluxadoline 100 mg: 31.7% Table 4). Of these patients, over half in each treatment group reported ≥ 1 GI AE with an onset date after a dose of loperamide (placebo: 16.6% eluxadoline 75 mg: 22.1% eluxadoline 100 mg: 21.4%). There was no clear association between the timing of loperamide rescue medication use and the reporting of GI AEs, with the majority of events reported > 14 days after the most recent loperamide dose. In those patients who had used rescue loperamide during the studies, the most common GI AEs reported (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in any treatment group) included constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea (Table 4). Constipation tended to be more common in patients treated with eluxadoline 100 mg compared with eluxadoline 75 mg or placebo (6.1% vs. 3.7% and 1.4%, respectively), although incidence was generally low. The incidence of constipation in these patients was similar to that observed in the full phase 3 population safety set (placebo: 2.5% eluxadoline 75 mg: 7.4% eluxadoline 100 mg: 8.6% (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data)).

### A randomised trial of ondansetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea [^3127f24a]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Our variable dosing regime mirrored clinical practice and we feel gives a better idea of how the drug will perform in clinical practice. It undoubtedly improved response rate and had we chosen a fixed dose many patients would have developed constipation and probably dropped out or had worsening symptoms. As expected, the median number of tablets per day was much lower for ondansetron than placebo, median (IQR) 1 (0.5–1.4) and 2 (1–5), respectively. However, dose titration does complicate analysis since only the stool diaries in the last 2 weeks are truly informative of the response, meaning that we cannot impute data to allow for incomplete diaries, which would be normal practice. These incomplete data led to only 98 subjects being analysed.

Our evaluation time of just 2 weeks was short but in patients with diarrhoea and rapid transit, drug effects tend to be rapid and quickly reversible, for example with loperamide. We found that most subjects returned to their previous bowel habit within the 2-week washout and only 17 patients required longer.

### Loperamide induced cardiac arrhythmia successfully supported with veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO), molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [^e7720a47]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: This case of Loperamide misuse had refractory ventricular arrhythmias and was successfully supported by VA ECMO. Loperamide is currently available without prescription and can be obtained in large quantities over the internet despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2016 black box warning noting cardiac toxicity. This case illustrates the life-threatening toxicity of loperamide and suggests a supportive modality to provide clinical time while the drug is cleared endogenously or exogenously. Case report: A 36-year-old female was found minimally responsive. Vital signs and monitoring revealed wide complex bradycardia, undetectable blood pressure, hypothermia, bradypnea, and hypoglycemia. The rhythm degenerated to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cardia refractory to multiple ACLS protocols. VA-ECMO was initiated with immediate stabilization. Subsequent history revealed massive consumption of loperamide taking 400-600mg daily. Highest known loperamide and N-desmethyl-loperamide levels were 32 and 500ng/ml respectively. Since loperamide and metabolites are known to be protein bound, molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) was initiated for toxin clearance. Additionally, she developed acute renal failure supported by CRRT. She was ultimately weaned from ECMO, MARS, and CRRT and discharged neurologically intact on hospital day 12. Discussion: VA ECMO for hemodynamic support provided the needed time for natural resolution of the cardiac toxicity while providing adequate perfusion. MARS was used in the setting of highly protein bound toxins, but drug clearance could not be demonstrated through serial levels. VA ECMO (or referral to a center with VA ECMO) should be considered with lethal loperamide-induced cardiotoxicity and perhaps other cardio-toxins.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Diarrhea

Inform patients experiencing grade 2 diarrhea (an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools) or greater or experiencing severe bloody diarrhea with severe abdominal pain and fever to stop taking capecitabine tablets. Advise patients on the use of antidiarrheal treatments (e.g.,

loperamide) to manage diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Cardiotoxicity

Advise patients of the risk of cardiotoxicity and to immediately contact their healthcare provider or to go to an emergency room for new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they have a known DPD deficiency. Advise patients if they have complete or near complete absence of DPD activity they are at an increased risk of acute early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by capecitabine tablets (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Pathophysiology and management of diabetic gastroenteropathy [^f2f79eed]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antidiarrhoeal products

Compared to the general population, people with diabetes have a two-fold risk of having diarrhoea (11 vs 6%). Very often, diarrhoea is induced by glucose-stabilizing treatment such as metformin or other medications commonly taken by people with diabetes. If no underlying condition is found for development of diarrhoea, pharmacological treatment will usually include dietary assessment and intervention in combination with loperamide, an opioid receptor agonist. Uncontrolled observational studies have shown that the α 2 adrenergic agonist clonidine may reduce diarrhoea in people with diabetes. The use of clonidine is, however, restricted by its cardiovascular side effects.

Furthermore, diabetes significantly increases the risk of having faecal incontinence, which in frequently is aggravated by diarrhoea. If an underlying cause of diarrhoea can be identified, it must be addressed. If not, loperamide or dietary intervention may be indicated. In a number of persons, faecal incontinence is associated with neuropathy and reduced sensibility of the anal canal. In these cases, loperamide, suppositories or enemas should be considered. Treatment of refractory cases is very complex and may even require a stoma.

Neuromodulation

Neuromodulatory electrical stimulation of the sacral nerve, which is described in detail later, is an emerging technique for the treatment of faecal incontinence and potentially sensitivity in the anal canal. However, the role of sacral nerve stimulation in people with diabetic gastroenteropathy has not been investigated specifically.

Pharmacological management of sensory symptoms

In the management of abdominal pain in diabetes it is often impossible to distinguish between the different organ manifestations. This is due to the vague presentation of visceral symptoms with changing presentation of the pain and referral to somatic structures, and this should be taken into consideration. It can also be difficult to distinguish between symptoms such as nausea and pain evoked by dysmotility and those that are related to the sensory (and central) neuropathy per se. In such cases the primary reason for pain such as constipation should be treated primarily. If all such reasons for the pain can be excluded, management should be directed against the neuropathy. Although only few studies have addressed treatment of visceral sensory symptoms in people with diabetes, the pharmaceutical options most often applied are reviewed here. On the other hand, the individual variability in phenotypical presentation of pain in diseases is greater between people than between pain syndromes. This indicates that mechanistic aetiologies and subsequent successful treatment should be based at the level of the individual rather than the disease per se. Hence, the recommendation for pharmacological management of visceral neuropathic pain follows the guidelines used for somatic neuropathies.

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^e527aa4c]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up: The patient was evaluated and underwent laboratory assessment before each SG dose in the infusion center.

Concern at follow-up: The patient noted that her pain improved after cycle 1. She was feeling well except for grade 1 diarrhea with loose watery stools 3–4 times daily that would start 3–4 days after each infusion. She had problems with constipation in the past and had been hesitant to use loperamide.

Treatment plan: C. diff assessment was negative. Blood laboratory assessments were within normal limits. Loperamide was started at 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. The patient was also given a prescription for 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine to use up to 4 times a day if loperamide was not effective. She was also encouraged to orally hydrate and notify her oncology team if diarrhea symptoms were not responding to these management strategies.

Follow-up and outcome: After using loperamide as needed for diarrhea, symptoms were controlled. Cycle 2, Day 1 of SG was administered at full dose without delay. A regimen for early loperamide therapy for diarrhea was again reinforced to the patient (as outlined in the Diarrhea subsection) as part of chemotherapy education during cycle 2, Day 1. The patient again experienced diarrhea that was treated immediately with loperamide at home, leading to early control and absence of progression to grade 2 diarrhea. The patient had renewed confidence that early and regular use of loperamide, as needed, was a proactive approach for managing her symptoms.

Key learnings:

Therapy with SG may continue while managing grade 1 diarrhea with diagnostic assessments and supportive measures.
Control of grade 1–2 diarrhea with medication and supportive measures, followed by resumption of the same dose of therapy on subsiding to grade ≤ 1 is prudent.
For grade 3–4 diarrhea, SG should be withheld while managing the toxicity. Then, SG can be resumed with a dose reduction, if necessary, once diarrhea subsides to grade 1 or resolves.
Loperamide can be employed once infectious causes of diarrhea are excluded. If loperamide is not effective, diphenoxylate-atropine may be administered. In severe cases resistant to diphenoxylate-atropine, octreotide can be employed.

### Topical loperamide for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain: a case report and literature review [^d3765655]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Peripheral nerve damage can result in neuronal hyperexcitability, resulting in neuropathic pain. Localized neuropathic pain is confined to a specific area not larger than a letter-size piece of paper. Topical analgesics are increasingly popular for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain because systemic agents for managing neuropathic pain often produce undesirable and intolerable side effects. Commonly used agents for topical use are amitriptyline, baclofen, ketamine and lidocaine; however, these agents do not always give the desired analgesic effect in some patients. We report for the first time a patient with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy and intractable localized neuropathic pain treated successfully with loperamide 5% cream. After application of loperamide 5% cream, the patient reported a complete reduction of pain within 30 mins, lasting for 2.5 hrs. Subsequently, the patient was able to reduce his daily intake of oxycodone, while using topical loperamide for pain relief. Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid agonist, commonly used against diarrhea. As a topical formulation, it is preferable over other opioids due to its low systemic bioavailability and low risk of crossing the blood–brain barrier. Peripheral upregulation and sensitization of opioid receptors at peripheral nerve endings and perhaps at other cell populations in the epidermis might be targets of topical loperamide.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for colorectal and anal cancer: the extent of recommendations for managing long-term symptoms and functional impairments [^746d2b4b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this review are the inclusion of international guidelines, a thorough search of both electronic databases and websites for 33 cancer societies, and guideline quality assessment against the criteria of the AGREE II tool. Two limitations of our review were the inclusion of only guidelines available in English, and with our search process, we could not accurately count the number of non-English guidelines excluded. Some non-English guidelines that we did not have resources to review may provide recommendations for long-term symptoms or functions. For example, the Dutch national guideline for CRC (which we are aware of as LW is a Dutch clinician) provides risk factors for fecal incontinence, recommends the use of diagnostic tools to evaluate long-term symptoms, and provides interventions for managing specific problems such as fecal incontinence with bulk-forming agents or loperamide to decrease fecal frequency. However, despite excluding non-English guidelines, we expect that they would be informed by the same international evidence that informed guidelines published in English.

In conclusion, the majority of guidelines for CRC reviewed did not provide recommendations for management of long-term symptoms and functioning impairment following treatment for CRC. Their recommendations primarily focus on detection of early recurrence, the timing of follow-up, which diagnostic tools to use, and on the importance of a healthy diet and weight, and active lifestyle after treatment. Few recommendations are available for how to reduce or manage symptom burden and improve HRQL. This may be due to lack of evidence about effectiveness of potential management strategies. There is need for clear evidence-based recommendations for managing long-term symptoms and functioning impairments to assist health professionals in supporting CRC survivors and to ameliorate suffering due to persistent symptoms and functioning impairments that often go unmanaged.

### Brugada syndrome associated with adolescent loperamide abuse [^bb8388a1]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 14-year-old boy with obesity, hypertension, and chronic loperamide abuse who presented to our facility with symptoms of opioid withdrawal and type 1 Brugada pattern on an electrocardiogram. He was treated for anxiety and withdrawal. There were no documented dysrhythmias. His Brugada pattern resolved by hospital day 5 and remained resolved 12 days postadmission. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in the SCN5A gene (c. 5038G > A, p. Ala1680Thr), which has been reported in association with Brugada syndrome. To date, there are no published reports of pediatric loperamide use associated with a Brugada pattern on an electrocardiogram. We propose that chronic loperamide use unmasked the electrocardiographic phenotype associated with his gene mutation.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone in patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic noncancer pain: a phase 3, open-label trial [^448d7376]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Clinical Study Design

This was a multicenter phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00804141) conducted between December 03, 2008, and September 20, 2010, in six countries. Patients were 18 years of age or older and had chronic, nonmalignant pain for two or more months, were receiving opioids for one or more months, and had OIC for one month prior to screening. A diagnosis of OIC was confirmed if patients met two or more of the following criteria: experienced hard or lumpy stool for 25% or more of bowel movements (BMs), had straining during 25% or more of BMs, experienced a sensation of incomplete evacuation after 25% or more of BMs, required use of manual maneuvers to facilitate 25% or more of BMs, or had three or fewer BMs per week. All patients received open-label subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 12 mg once daily for 48 weeks. Methylnaltrexone dose could be adjusted as needed to a maximum of one dose per day and a minimum of one dose per week.

Patients were excluded if they had a history of chronic constipation before opioid treatment, had a diagnosis of bowel obstruction, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse, or other significant GI disorder, had experienced inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or megacolon six months before screening, had a history of rectal bleeding not associated with fissures or hemorrhoids, or had a history of cancer within five years before study entry. Patients with CV conditions (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension) that might put the patient at greater risk and those with electrocardiogram (ECG) or laboratory abnormalities were not eligible for participation. Patients who had unstable hepatic, renal, pulmonary, psychiatric, or other medical conditions that might increase their risks during the study (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension) were also excluded. Use of lubiprostone, tegaserod, loperamide, partial opioid agonists, or a combination of opioid agonists/antagonists was not permitted; however, laxative use and nonpharmacologic treatment (manual disimpaction and pelvic floor retraining procedures) were allowed. Use of diphenoxylate and atropine was also permitted. The study was approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each participating site and was conducted in accordance with the Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinic Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.

American Gastroenterological Association–American College of Gastroenterology guideline — prucalopride dosing, safety, and contraindications — states: "The recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in adults and 1 mg daily in individuals with severe renal impairment (ie, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min)." "The efficacy in persons 65 years and older is comparable with the overall study population." The most frequent adverse effects are "headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea," which "occurred within the first week of treatment and typically resolved within a few days," and "Five percent of individuals discontinued prucalopride because of side effects." In a safety database of "4,476 subjects, 4 individuals attempted suicide and 2 completed suicides, both of whom had discontinued prucalopride more than 1 month before the event," and "The label cautions patients and clinicians to be alert to unusual changes in mood and behavior and suicidal ideation." "No drug-associated risks of miscarriage, major birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes have been identified." Prucalopride "is contraindicated in patients with intestinal perforation or obstruction, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and toxic megacolon/megarectum."

### Torsades de pointes in the PACU after outpatient endoscopy: a case report [^4b8eb70f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The number of known medications with QT prolonging potential is well over 200 (AZCERT, Inc.). A reference to many, yet not all, commonly used perioperative medications with a known risk (KR) of TdP is available in Fig. 4 A. It is important to note that this patient had several risk factors predisposing her to this episode of TdP including marked electrolyte derangements, the administration of more than one QT prolonging medication, female gender, and her undiagnosed congenital conduction abnormalities. It is also imperative to recognize that her history of presumed "paroxysmal SVT" should have prompted further questioning and investigation. It is most likely that her history of previous syncopal episodes were episodes of TdP that she miraculously survived without intervention. The history of syncope attributed to an arrhythmia (albeit undiagnosed) may represent a life-threatening condition and appropriate evaluation should be performed to avoid potential catastrophic outcomes.

The primary lesson of this case report includes having a high index of suspicion for electrolyte derangements after chronic diarrhea complicated by bowel preparation and minimal oral intake in the preceding days. Additionally, it highlights the importance maintaining a broad differential diagnosis and considering uncommon conditions when evaluating patients with seemingly common presentations such as post-operative nausea and vomiting. In conclusion, we believe it would be reasonable to consider pre-operative laboratory and/or electrocardiogram in patients with known or suspected cardiac conduction abnormalities and those with a history of prolonged secretory diarrhea given the potential for marked electrolyte derangements.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^623373a4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The gastroenterologist's point of view

As a preventive treatment, administration of macrogol should start from 8.75 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 combined with electrolytes, dissolved in 125 mL of water (or corresponding dose/volume of other macrogol compound) once a day in patients without constipation, up to a maximum dose of 17.5 g dissolved in 250 mL twice daily. The higher dosages could cause undesirable effects, such as loss of appetite due to fullness and nausea. In such cases, the dose of macrogol should be halved or other drugs should be considered. The response to macrogol generally lasts 5–6 days at the most; for this reason, administration should be started early. In case of unsatisfactory response, a prokinetic agent is suggested. Metoclopramide should be avoided due to its action on the proximal gastrointestinal tract and its side effects. Prucalopride is a selective serotonin (5-HT 4) receptor agonist stimulating the peristaltic reflex. Principal adverse effects are headache, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

Lubiprostone and linaclotide exert a secretagogue action, promoting intestinal motility and facilitating bowel transit. Potential side effects are watery diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Physical activity, within the limits of the patient's functional reserve, and hydration are also of paramount importance in the prevention of OIBD.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^ad797039]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Definition of medically refractory gastroparesis — criteria and prerequisite trials — can be defined as "persistent symptoms in the context of objectively confirmed gastric emptying delay, despite the use of dietary adjustment and metoclopramide as a first-line therapeutic agent," with the proviso that "symptoms are not medication induced (eg, opioids, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists)." Generally, "nausea and vomiting are the predominant persistent symptoms," and based on a single trial "a small particle size, reduced fat diet should be used for a minimum period of 4 weeks," while "a reasonable trial of metoclopramide, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication for gastroparesis, is a minimum of 10 mg three times daily before meals and at bedtime for at least 4 weeks."

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^92cbde28]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Methadone blockade of cardiac inward rectifier KCurrent augments membrane instability and amplifies U waves on surface ECGs: a translational study [^781e0129]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly half a million people died from prescription and illicit opioids between 1999 and 2018. While all opioids suppress ventilatory drive leading to respiratory arrest, synthetic opioids such as methadone and loperamide present an additional risk for sudden cardiac arrest caused by life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Both drugs possess dual aromatic ring structures that interact within the distal human ether‐à‐go‐go–related gene (hERG) channel, which, at least in part, explains their proarrhythmic risk. Methadone is recognized by the World Health Organization as an essential medication to treat opioid dependency and chronic pain. Over the past decades, however, methadone has been disproportionately implicated in opioid‐related fatalities despite representing a small fraction of prescription volume. In a community‐based forensic study of sudden cardiac death, methadone was present in 72 of 178 decedents while other opioids were found in only 11, suggesting a distinct proclivity to trigger cardiac arrest. While causal inferences cannot be based solely on postmortem findings, this association was subsequently borne out in worldwide pharmacovigilance data, where methadone was among the most frequently reported drugs associated with cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia. To date, however, the mechanism of proarrhythmia caused by this compound has not been fully characterized.

### FDA warns about serious heart problems with high doses of the… [^6722951a]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter and prescription diarrhea medicine loperamide, including through abuse or misuse of the product, can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death. The risk of these serious heart problems, including abnormal heart rhythms, may also be increased when high doses of loperamide are taken with several kinds of medicines that interact with loperamide. Health care professionals should be aware that use of higher than recommended doses of loperamide can result in serious cardiac adverse events. Consider loperamide as a possible cause of unexplained cardiac events including QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest.
- Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, stomach discomfort, nausea or vomiting, and constipation.
- Higher than recommended doses of loperamide can cause serious cardiac events, including QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, syncope, and death.
- Consider loperamide as a possible cause of these unexplained cardiac events. In some reported cases, these events were not attributed to loperamide, resulting in ineffective and/or delayed treatment. Some cases reported more than one cardiac event. Ten cases resulted in death. Nine of the deaths were due to ingestion of large amounts of loperamide, and there was one sudden cardiac death after the patient ingested an unknown amount of loperamide. In many cases, standard antiarrhythmic medications were ineffective and only electrical pacing resulted in control of the arrhythmias.

We also searched the medical literature and identified additional cases of serious cardiac events with loperamide. 1–5 One case resulted in death, one was loperamide-induced Brugada syndrome, and three were Torsades de Pointes after ingesting large doses of loperamide. In all three Torsades de Pointes cases, the patients self-treated their chronic diarrhea with massive doses of loperamide. Multiple advanced measures such as defibrillation and pacemaker insertion were needed. Since our review, four additional articles describing serious cardiac events with loperamide have been published, including two that resulted in death. 6–9.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^62701083]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

9.2 Specific drug treatments of symptoms

No treatment is ideal, and even though some help to correct physiological abnormalities, they may not affect the patient's symptoms (boxes 3 and 5).

Drug therapycan be difficult and often drugs with conflicting actions are used (prokinetic for constipation and anticholinergic for colicky pain). Essentially, the drug therapy is targeted at the symptom perceived as most important by the patient.

Prokinetic treatments are used to try and improve the dysmotility itself and can return some of the measured abnormalities towards normal. They may especially help with vomiting and constipation. Prokinetic drugs are generally not used after a bowel anastomosis. Some of the previously used prokinetic drugs have been withdrawn or can only be used with extreme caution. They include domperidone and metoclopramide (D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists) which stimulate gastric emptying and small intestinal transit, and enhance the strength of oesophageal sphincter contraction. Metoclopramide also increases the release of acetylcholine from some enteric nerves. Domperidone is a selective antagonist of peripheral D 2 dopamine receptors, which does not have the acetylcholine-like effect of metoclopramide. National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) alerts have been issued for domperidone highlighting problems with prolonged QTc, therefore long-term use should be subject to QTc monitoring. The extrapyramidal side effects of metoclopramide (especially in children) and the potentially irreversible tardive dyskinesia in elderly subjects, together with no evidence of consistent benefit in gastroparesis, caused the European Medicines Agency's Committee to recommend that metoclopramide is not used in the long term. Cisapride, a 5-HT 4 agonist, enhances acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus without having anti-dopaminergic effects and may have been of particular benefit if MMCs were present on small intestinal manometry. In a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 26 patients, cisapride helped abdominal pain, improved solid gastric emptying and the MMC. Unfortunately, due to an increased risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias (probably relating to a prolonged QT interval) in patients taking other medications or suffering from underlying conditions known to increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cisapride was withdrawn. Tegaserod, a 5-HT 4 receptor partial agonist, increased stool frequency in irritable bowel syndromeand improved the symptoms in functional dyspepsia, but was withdrawn due to an increased risk of heart attacks or strokes.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^20608d52]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

9.4.1 Dietary adjustments/fluid management

Gastric motility may be far less deranged for liquids than for solids with the result that many patients tolerate liquid feeds better than solid meals. Sometimes frequent small meals with low-fat, low-fibre and liquid nutritional supplements may be helpful.

If the patient has a stoma and a short bowel, fluid restriction, a sipped glucose saline solution, use of loperamide sometimes in high dose (occasionally with the addition of codeine phosphate) will reduce the risks of dehydration, sodium and magnesium depletion. If a high net secretory output occurs, a proton pump inhibitor (or occasionally octreotide) may be needed.

Post-feeding orthostatic symptoms in partial autonomic failure may respond to dietary adjustments and drugs such as fludrocortisone, midodrine and octreotide.

9.4.2 Vitamin/mineral deficiencies

Care is needed to ensure that micronutrient deficiencies particularly of iron, vitamin B 12 and the fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A, D and E, do not occur. Magnesium deficiency is common especially if a high output stoma. Magnesium oxide may cause fewer osmotic effects than other preparations but is expensive.

Bone mineral density is important to address and should be assessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning in those with malnutrition. For patients who cannot take oral measures to improve bone density, parenteral bisphosphonates such as zoledronate should be considered.
